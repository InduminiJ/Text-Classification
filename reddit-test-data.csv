1,   Hey so I am running two dnd groups for my college club and we have ten players that want to divide into two groups. The issue is 6 of the players want to be together and have listed each other as their top 5 choices. So I put up a poll on whether we should do a 6-4 grouping with the 4 groups being allowed to recruit two more players and the 6 being capped at 6 or rather a 5-5 grouping. The poll just concluded and the votes are directly proportional to the grouping being a 6-4 in favor of the 6-4 grouping.  The issue is I don't want to be unfair to the four groups as leading with this decision will result in their dissatisfaction whereas a 5-5 would result in a lot of people's dissatisfaction. Any ideas on how I should proceed?  We have already run one session with ten players but a lot of people complained saying that waiting an hour for their turn was not preferable so I am doing two groups in one world which impact one another
2,   I own a lenovo Ideapad 3 for 2 or 3 months now  and Im starting to see my screen flicker and tear from time to time and I dont know why  but my laptops screen flickers more often while charging.  so I connected it to an external monitor  and the external screen was clearly fine so I tried updating  rollbacking and manually update my drivers but nothing seems to work  I also tried updating my bios but its the same thing and I promise I did not fucking punch my laptop.  I tried fixing this problem for over some weeks so Im tired  Its not severe but its feels really annoying
3,   Not  long ago I came across a TTRPG system that really blew my mind. It is a  book ( I will intentionally omit the name ) Created and published in  the year 2000. The book was never reprinted and is not very popular. The  studio and creators are still around but moved on to other systems.  After finding the system  my mind was really racing. I want to take the system  make some changes and build a different setting.  Here is a question. Is this legal or copyright infringement?  I  am seeing games  especially in OSR scene freely almost copying D&D  books. Even to point of incredible accuracy. So where is the line? What  should be changed  how and how much? Note that I am only taking the  mechanic and modifying it. Everything else - branding  story  setting -  is new.  Again. I am not trying to steal anything. Its more of a homage to a great system that is unfortunately abandoned.  ps:  contacting authors and asking for permission is possibility. But for  sake of argument let say that they are not available at all.
4,"  1280x800p  Shadow of the tomb raider HIGH 36 FPS   Doom MEDIUM 46-60 FPS  Cyberpunk HIGH 20-30 FPS (crashed)  Dota 2 HIGH 47  LOW 80   Dota 2 controls are too awkward to play with against humans  6 hours battery life  'still has a lot of bugs' (not launch version)  Google translate translated whatever they called Gabe into ""G Fat"".... lol.   Not very optimistic about performance personally  settings tested were all over the place but considering Doom  one of the most optimized modern games (especially for a Linux emulation)  and it's a standard benchmark title and was dropping to 46fps on medium at 800p  screams that every other modern game will need to be on low to even have a chance at fluid framerates. Unless you're into that 24-30fps 'cinematic' experience consoles used to have. From eyeballing the performance it looks like it's worse than a gt 1030. But hey  $400 and portable  if you need PC games in your ~~pocket~~ bag  this seems like the answer."
5,  To output 1080p content at 144Hz  you will need either a Dual-Link DVI  DisplayPort  or HDMI 1.4 cable (or better). However  note that some monitors with HDMI 1.4 are limited to 60Hz or 120Hz.  For 144Hz at 1440p  you will need at least HDMI 2.0 or DisplayPort 1.2 while for 4K 144Hz you are going to need HDMI 2.1 or alternatively  DisplayPort 1.4 with DSC 1.2.
6,- **Pathfinder Kingmaker** is on there. I loved PoE like you. This game is an isometric game  I preferred PoE but sank a good 100+ to the PC version of this game. Never played on PS but I'd imagine it would not be as good.    - **Nier Automata**  Good JRPG. I don't love JRPGs and I don't love this game as much as this sub-reddit does. But I have to admit it's a good game.   - **Fallout New Vegas**  IMHO is the best RPG available on PS Now. It's glitchy and buggy but has a great story and really lets you feel in charge about your character and the world around you. It's not turn based.   - **Undertale** - Is for me personally a great game. Turn based battles with uhhh mini-games   hard to explain. But it's so off beat it's really not for everyone and I don't expect everyone to like it. Do you like offbeat things and not mind low graphics? Maybe this is worth investigating for you.    - I don't know if it's still on PSNow but I used my PSNow to play **Torment Tides of Numeria**. It's a spritual successor to Planscape Torment  although if your a fan of that game I think this game will disappoint. Still kept my interest well enough.    - **Elder Scrolls 4 Oblivion** is a really good open world RPG. If you liked Skyrim or moderen Fallout games you might really enjoy this game. Not turn based as per your preferences.    - While not an RPG I find **Horizion Zero Dawn** to be a terrific action game with light RPG elements that is worth most gamer's time.   - **XCom 2** is a decent tactical turn based RPG. It's light on story  limited number of classes for your party  but heavy on tactics and the game shines in it's turn based combat.
7, [Lucid Sight](https://www.lucidsight.com/)  the independent game studio behind MLB Champions  CSC with Star Trek  Herocade  Polyrunner  and several other games spanning VR  AR  and NFTs is announcing that it has raised $2.58 million to launch a cloud-hosted multiplayer service called [Colyuseus Arena](https://www.colyseus.io/arena).  Colyseus Arena is a fully managed solution that handles server management  infrastructure  and scaling so that game makers can focus on game design and development.  The funding round was led by Galaxy Interactive.  Other investors included VamosVentures  Goal Venture Partners  Gaingels  as well as existing investors.  The new round brings total raised to $15.4 Million.  Earlier this year Lucid Sight acquired Colyseus  the most popular open-source Node.js multiplayer framework.  The Colyseus open-source framework has had over 300 000 downloads since it was created six years ago and averages 10 000 downloads per month.  Lucid Sight created Colyseus Arena because the number one request from Colyseus game developers was a cloud-hosted solution for Colyseus.  Colyseus Arena reduces or eliminates the need for dedicated networking and DevOps engineers in multiplayer games.  Networking and DevOps engineers have always created a $500k to $1MM annual drag on every multiplayer game Lucid Sight has ever created.  Our goal with Arena is to bring that cost way down  so more styles of casual  hypercasual  and NFT games can afford rich multiplayer experiences.  Colyseus will always be open-source and we made the lowest tier of Arena FREE because we wanted no barrier for developers to dive in and *GET TO FUN FASTER*. said Lucid Sight CEO Randy Saaf.   With Colyseus Arena  game developers can set up  manage and update their servers with a few clicks from an intuitive administration dashboard.  Features include:    * Get started for FREE with an Indie/Dev plan. * Easily manage your servers and add server-side logic from an intuitive dashboard. * Optimized server configuration and infrastructure setup. * Global availability with 7 data centers and regional access points. * Worry-free scaling with tier 4 and up plans so when your game peaks there will be no interruptions.  * Enterprise-grade load balancing & custom matchmaking. * 24/7 monitoring & DDoS Protection * DevOps as a service for non-Colyseus users * Host your custom Linux Servers. * Host Unity / Unreal headless server. * Get fully customized solutions for projects of all sizes. * The simple setup allows you to GET TO FUN FASTER.  Lucid Sight began accepting Colyseus Arena Early Access sign-ups in Feb 2021 and has since amassed hundreds of customers with games supporting millions of Daily Active Users.  Customers of note include Lightfox Games ([Knights Edge](https://www.lightfoxgames.com/knights-edge))  PM Studios ([Squish](https://www.play-squish.com/))  Tobspr ([SchoolBreak.io](https://poki.com/en/g/schoolbreak-io))  [Kirka.io](https://kirka.io/)   and massively popula
8, Alright so I just got an M.2 recently  before I installed it  everything was booting fine  no issues  afterwards I tried to boot and nothing turned on  no fans or anything except for my LED Fail detector  said my CPU wasnt working or wasnt detected. I confirmed the socket pins werent bent  Ive reconnected the whole PC  now I have had XMP active at 2933 before I disconnected everything  some people are saying that could be the issue.
9, An extremely good episode.    The emotional moment with the restored Fido lands extremely well  like the renewed oath of the main characters  which is a direct nod to Spearhead formation.     Eugene death is abrupt and disturbing and portrayed in a very realistic fashion. Sometimes anime that deal with war are accused to glorifying the spectacle and downplaying the anti war message  something that Eighty Six definitely avoid. Here you have the depiction of a person reduced to a lump of meat in a desolate battlefield and it's very effective  striking a balance between how gory is to die in an explosion like that and at the same time making it something not for those who just enjoy gory deaths in fiction. It's a very sad moment and the fact that we didn't even saw the events that cause it enhance how mundane is to end like this in a true battlefield.     At the same time the main characters are now considered as war obsessed psychopaths  an unpleasant nomea that many real life war veterans know very well. They are objectively difficult to relate as it's remarked when Grethe Wenzel is surprised that they don't like the monument for their comrades. It doesn't hel that they are developing a vehicle that's considered a dangerous pilot killer. Arguably being in a Vanagandr is dangerous as well  but sacrificing armor for speed makes the Reiginleif comparable to the US tank destroyer in WW2  which they were supposed to defeat German tanks with speed but ended up with tragic losses when initially deployed.     Anyway i don't like how the English subs translated Feldreb into Combat Armor. It's a foreign word used in anime because it's supposed to be the iconic name of the main mechas and shouldn't be translated in my opinion.
10, Anyone else agree that Kingdom Hearts series is their favorite RPG game  series? I'm usually bad at RPG's but I still love Kingdom Hearts  nothing like it. I love Kingdom Hearts 1 the most  it's such a classic and KH II was great too but some of the battle systems was kinda confusing. I wasn't a huge fan of KH III tbh  it was cool seeing the Toy Story world but that Frozen world  made me quit the game and come back a few months later  so easy to get lost  if KH 4 uses Frozen II I hope they fix that mistake. I've never played Birth By Sleep yet or finished Chain of Memories  the styles are too different for me. I did like Dream Drop Distance though again pretty confusing. I also didn't 100% everything on all the games and beat all the super bosses at least for KH II and never got any of the ultima weapons  WAY too much grinding. Sorry to rant  what are your thoughts and on KH III and what do you look forward to in KH 4?

12,- Baldur Gate 1 and 2 - Icewind Dale 1 and 2 - Neverwinter Nights 1 - Shadowrun series  - Planescape Torment - Torment: Tides of Numenara  - Wasteland 2 and 3 - Pillars of Eternity 1 and 2  Most of these have remastered versions on Steam  dont feel old at all.
13," Baldurs Gate anyone?  The characters would respond when you gave them a command and one of Imoen's lines was "" You're a queer fellow"". Because you would often give commands quickly the clip would cut short resulting in her berating the player saying "" You're a queer"" over and over again.  Ahhh 90's gaming..."
14, BS. Possibly lowered the lift on a rim by mistake and bent the rim. Ive seen it happen multiple times in the last 10 years working as an automotive technician. Guys lean the rim onto the lift and forget its there  bring the car down and tada  bent rim.
15, Disclaimer: I've only played a few hours so far so I can't comment on the experience as a whole.   It's not bad. My biggest complaint is that all of the setting information and important terms/lingo are frontloaded into codex entries that pop up almost every time you progress the dialogue  at least early on.     It's not like Disco Elysium where your character doesn't know anything so it has an excuse to work questions about the world into the dialogue naturally. It can really kill the pacing. I think the game would have hugely benefitted from the option to highlight certain words to mouse over for a small summary of their meaning  similarly to how Tyranny did it.  The writing and characters are not as good as DE  but honestly DE's writing is so far ahead of almost every other RPG that I don't think it should be expected to keep up  even despite the fact that both games are mostly reading. Expect young adult novel levels of writing for the most part; it's fairly simplistic but it wasn't unpleasantly mediocre.
16, Has anyone here ever noticed that the vast majority of RPG games or games with RPG elements put spiders at some point in the game (especially the giants)? I don't know how many times I was playing and I came across one of these  honestly I still haven't got used to it lol the witcher 3  Monster Hunter World and Dark Souls 2 are some examples of this
17, I have a character who spent three years fighting against an enemy. It has been five years since the truce was signed. She has been running data about the potential outcomes should her people resume hostilities with the former enemy. She has concluded that her former State would destroy itself regardless of her State's victory in a war. They will either get completely wiped out  as this is the 3rd time they've been at war with the enemy. Or  in the case of victory  they will inevitably tear themselves apart from infighting.   Would it make sense for my character to align herself with her former enemy to ensure they remain a regional superpower to dissuade her former comrades from taking up arms?
18, I have recently upgraded to windows 11 and while I am using my oneplus bulllets wireless z bluetooth earphones there is a lot of sound crackling  while I do absolutely anything. Tried updating the drivers and unpairing and pairing again but nothing helped. Disabled the enhancements and tweaked a lot in the setting but can't get any progress! I think it is due to some fault in windows 11.
19, I really dislike narrative rpgs as the lack of immersion kills any fun for me since you cannot be surprised by something that you just created  and since I love worldbuilding and want to do it myself  not collaboratively.  That said  perhaps I can help you.  >any fight with a few goblins  which in-game lasts half a minute  will last about two hours real-time   This problem  which occurs often in dnd and pathfinder due to complexity of rules  can be fixed. In osr games such as knave  fights are very quick. And then you can be right back to the immersion and being your character. I highly recommend the osr genre.
20, Im looking for anime where a guy crossdresses as a cute girl/woman similar to a femboy/trap or whatever. Reason why Im asking is because I love femboys and guys that look and dress up as cute girls  dont worry Im straight tho.
21, Im still undecided if i should get the game or not. But i have read that the game is very short and that the choices dont really matter. Is any of this actually true and is this game actually worth it? This is coming from a Disco Elysium fan btw so my expectations are pretty high.
22, I've had this issue with my 08 4runner since the new type of gas pumps came out that have the fume protective mechanism on them. Whenever I am at a gas station that has the type of pumps with the rubber according fume cover  the gas stops flowing quickly and often will not restart again. The only remedy I have found is holding the pump at a weird angle to allow air to get in under the rubber piece. I have to hold it in this awkward position throughout the whole fueling process or it will shut off again. This never happens with the older style pumps.  Any advice on what might be going on and how to fix it?
23, Places like Mixam are actually quite economical but you have to print a large number for it to make any sense (say  50-100 copies). I don't know of anything besides Lulu that can do what you're looking for. I assume places like Bookbaby are similar.  I invested in a color laserjet printer. It is pricey but the output looks good. The printer cost me $400 and the cutter about $100 (I think); I use higher quality paper too. But I can now print whatever I wish  and it usually looks good (assuming the books are smaller). The only recommendation I would make is that you either get an edge-to-edge capable printer OR one that can print larger pages (e.g. larger than US Letter or A4) so you can easily cut without shrinking first.   That said  my town has a local printer that does a good job; I think I spend something like $30 on a nice color printout (i do the stapling/binding myself).
24, So i recently got my hands on a 1070 that had problems displaying.  And i thought to myself easy fix  probably just some driver problems  But after tinkering alone with it for 2 days  it still won't post.

26, You need to grow a thick skin if you want to survive in the game industry. I've got a lot of hate over the years. People were mad one time because in the language selection screen  in the languages list  English was higher than Russian  so I was accused of treating my own people as lesser nation to others somehow.  You just need to learn to ignore these assholes  ban them and move on with your life.

I feel that Will is probably gonna regret [when he wins against Blood](https://i.imgur.com/xOg77d0.jpg) and I already have a gut feeling on what's about to happen.   [Will wishing he looks like Blood](https://i.imgur.com/uTvW0JX.jpg) feels like foreshadowing. I've said this last week but my theory is that Blood could be Will's biological father with Mary even possibly being his biological mom so whatever is going to happen next week in Will's coming-of-age ritual  I don't think I will be ready for it."
33,### The Duke of Death and His Maid  *Genres: Comedy  Romance  Slice of Life  Drama*  #### Synopsis  *Cursed by a witch to kill any living thing he touches  a young Duke lives out his days in his familys secluded villa  far from guests and people he might inadvertently kill. He is assisted by his live-in maid  a flirtatious and cute girl who enjoys nothing more than getting close to him and teasing him.*  #### Review  This show got a lot of bad initial reviews on account of its shallow shtick  in which the busty maid constantly teases the fretful boy who is unable to touch her without killing her. And the first few episodes didnt really rise to anything beyond that. But given enough time  the characters and their relationships became a little more endearing  and the circumstances of the Dukes curse more intriguing.  Lets touch on the visuals first. For starters  its a 3D show. The animation is pretty standard for such formats  visually lacking but not atrocious. Notably  many of the backgrounds and environments are given a canvas texture  making the scenes appear as if theyre paintings. I thought this would become annoying  but it mostly faded into the background or meshed well with the gothic/classical aesthetic and soundtrack. This produced an atmosphere that worked really well with the tone of the show.  The major themes are loneliness and human connection. The Duke lives a solitary life in a huge mansion  spending his days enjoying tea and playing piano. He has very few visitors  is a pariah to his family  and is somewhat of an urban legend in the surrounding area. He is assisted by his elderly butler Rob  and the beautiful maid Alice. His life is gloomy and solitary  but as Alice refuses to let him wallow in self-pity  he begins to change his outlook on life.  That relationship between the Duke and Alice is what drives the show. At its heart  its a romance. Its about a girl who refuses to let a boy turn to despair  and how she helps him regain his self-worth. Its about two people developing an intense connection  and the barrier that prevents them from embracing one another. But its also about not letting barriers stop you from enjoying time with the one you love. The progression of the Duke and Alices relationship is not fully hindered by his curse. The joy of the show is watching them work around it  get used to it  and adapt to it. The ease with which they play with fire  getting close to each other and throwing caution to wind in favor of expressing their connection  is both nerve wracking and inspiring. Its sweet  and makes their interactions enjoyable  even if theres the occasional thigh or cleavage flash.  The worst thing I can say about this show is that it can be a little boring. Its definitely slowly paced  and provides little in the way of action or excitement (beyond the teasing romance). But it was often funny  and did include some intrigue and mystery as to the circumstances of the Dukes curse  which I expect wil

Damnit Eugene just couldn't stop himself from triggering those death flags huh?...  That ED song was super powerful too  appreciate that we're still getting new ED songs for special episodes this cour/season as well.
36,#1: We've been playing a semi homebrew d20 modern. I allowed my players to go a little wild  but I also stated  that I'm gonna give them disadvantages. How it went?  -Jack Daniels. Akimbo Gunmancer with squit. He got high as hell ACC with akimbo only  because of his squint.   -The Castle. Meat tank  whose STR was scaling with quality of the Doors he's been wielding (ended with bunker Doors with almost str cap)  -Yayamiomate (his name is a Polish pun  it's literal balls to the floor). A samurai on chemo  with every possible sickness. But! As long he wields his magical katana  he can't die from sickness. Also when he Hurts someone with his weapon  enemy gets random sickness.  -Suomi Perkele. Son of the Nokia founder  mute but he wields old nokia 3310 that casts spells and allows him to speak. My player took his laptop and when he used to speak  he went to the text to speech  and it spoke for the player.   #2: Post Apo: Neuroshima They got a shit ton of RPG missiles  but they got 1 Man that was very muscular archer... They did big ass longbow that technically (1 player was almost engineer  so he calculated it) could shoot RPG missiles and they could explode. They exploited it as long as they had them. Best thing was when he shot a group of thugs  killed all of them  hostage  and made terribly big explosion on fuel depo.

40,"$690 with active cooling with 2 fans  and only 2 ram slots? This looks decent  but it's overdesigned and overpriced.  I guess 2 RAM slots is good for those looking for hardcore memory OC  but still feels ""cheap"" with that MSRP."
41,$72k is higher than the standard QA entry level position by quite a lot  possibly because 'QA analyst' isn't a typical title and many actual entry level positions are contract work. So a FTE QA associate is often a bit more senior.   All that being said  QA tester is one of the lower-requirement positions at a game studio. Hi-Rez not having specific experience or education requirements for this position isn't unusual at all  although if you have any kind of relevant experience it'll help a lot. Even just playing games  being able to reproduce and document bugs  and not trying to use it as a backdoor to game design will put you in the top tier of applicants.

This week you'll learn how to show a path to a target position using the NavMesh and a LineRenderer  even with a Third or First Person Controller. That's right  no NavMeshAgent requirement here! We'll still have a baked NavMesh that we'll use to determine the path  but we'll allow the player to freely move with WASD and jump! We'll also implement some configurations such as height above the ground and how frequently to recalculate the path.

44,(Not ordered from 1 to 10  just my 10 in random order)  - Futaba - Annoying Senpai. - Natsumi - Annoying Senpai. - Takeda - Annoying Senpai. - Nasse - Platinum End. - Lugh (I liked him even more his in former life though) - Assassin Isekai. - Maegami-chan - Tawawa on Monday. - Lev - Vampire Cosmonaut. - Irina - Vampire Cosmonaut. - Riko - Pride of orange. - Coach (forgot her name) - Pride of orange.  2-3 girls from Jahy-Sama would probably make my top 10  but they're not from this season.  I also really enjoy Mieruko-chan so far  but not really because of the characters  so I couldn't find a way to have them in this list. I like them well enough  they're not just that special I suppose? The story is great  the character are fine.
45,(Not referring to this video but on Fractal cases) is it only me or it feels weird how GN allows advertisements of products they reviewed (and even explicitly refers to tests theyve done.) Im not saying anything shady is happening but there definitely seems to be conflicts of interest here.
46,*  stay humble * Go to an HPDE group with good qualified instructors. * Pick _everyone's_ brains  absorb everything you can * be smooth! if you want to test your smoothness  go karting  you'll find out what non-smooth inputs do to stability * Dont over think shit * Really  dont over think. Go in stock  determine what you may want to change a few days in  you wont have any actual feels for things otherwise. * Dont think iracing gives you much experience. I went in to my first track day with _so many laps_ on Road Atlanta. The main thing iRacing taught me what the turns are and how to be smooth. The actual physical experience is another 80% of what makes actual car driving.
47,* **Earthbound** * **Mother 3** * **Parasite Eve** * **Pokemon** Platinum  Fire Red  Heartgold  etc * **Persona** 2 EP  3  4  5 * **The World Ends With You** * **Deus Ex Human Revolution** maybe * **Stardew Valley** * **Final Fantasy 6 and 7**
48,* **LEFT FIELD / OFF THE RADAR**: XCOM 2012 and XCOM 2.  Heavily class based  lots of different paths and compromises and choices when choosing class abilities. * **Final Fantasy V**s Job system is loveable and fun.  The espers in FF6 and materia in FF7 are soulless and unfun in comparison.  Every job literally changes the character sprite  which is extraordinary for a 16-bit SNES game. * **Suikoden 2** is just plain awesome and has large 6-character party because it has a diverse array of friendship Unity attacks with *little to no MP cost* so its overpowered in a fun way if you carefully pick a team with friendship co-op attack potential.  It also has runes somewhat like FF7s materia  where each equippable rune gives some special tactic or ability and theres always a different between wearing the rune on your body or embedding it in a weapon. * uh **Tactics Ogre** the PSP version maybe.  Can be emulated on computer.
49,* **Suikoden 2** on PS1 emulation on computer.  It really doesnt get any better than this one  but a lot of people dont know it.  Dont forget the fan-made bugfix patch from rom hacking.net.  Theres 108 recruitable characters  no thats not a typo  theres 108.  [Look at this intro credit sequence](https://youtu.be/8X2B716Vc5A) * **Final Fantasy 6**  the best Final Fantasy game * **Final Fantasy 5** * **Earthbound**  great writing and music and sound effects and art * **Mother 3**  fan translation patch  definitely a good cast of characters (like Earthbound and Suikoden 2). * **Secret of Evermore** maybe * **Tactics Ogre** (PSP) * **Persona 2 EP** etc on PS1 emulation. * **Are Breath of Fire  like 2  3  4  good?**  Theres lots of neat looking RPGs on PSP but I havent played them in my emulator yet. I recently tried Tales of Destiny  and Lufia 2  and theyre OK.  > all the quests just feel like chores  **They are chores**.  Gamers love quantity not quality  so publishers and devs fill games with tedious busy work and gamers love them for it.  Gamers even glorify games by how many hours?  so publishers use filler and gamers lap it up.  None of the games I listed even have quests in the modern sense of the word.  You just go around to various places and settings and meet people and do the story and readnhe writing and do the action.

And of course [Shin is getting scolded by their instructor](https://i.imgur.com/5sui6w5.jpg) for his very creative evasive maneuver. [He's clearly not making any friends too](https://i.imgur.com/tlDvMCU.jpg) while in training school.   Looks like we're not gonna waste too much time in training school though since we timeskip [3 months ahead](https://i.imgur.com/L1hoQkC.jpg) where the gang has already graduated and Lt. Col. Wenzel surprises them [with a memorial for the fallen Eight-Six](https://i.imgur.com/Fb1MFBl.jpg) with all of their names [engraved in a monument.](https://i.imgur.com/1dzKHjC.jpg)  And it that's not the only surprise we're getting! [Fido is back!](https://i.imgur.com/6vJsS17.jpg) Looks like they found his wreck and discovered that his core is still intact. It's sweet to know that [he only activated when Frederica mentioned Shin's name.](https://i.imgur.com/Z8q4Boc.jpg) And just look [at that smile from Shin.](https://i.imgur.com/3Sqs4VI.jpg) seeing his old buddy back.  So literally [Frederica's position in the 1028th Test Unit](https://i.imgur.com/hN1tiZl.jpg) is that she's their official mascot? I love it! It's awesome since she clearly knows the dangers and wants to be there on her own accord but not gonna lie  [Giad's old tradition of having young girls in their unit](https://i.imgur.com/dE2XHMy.jpg) as some sort of morale booster is kinda fucked.  As much as I love to see [Shin kicking ass again on the field](https://i.imgur.com/XrjKBuG.jpg)  I kinda wish we got to take in the battle a bit more. That battle went by way too fast. [That new Reginleif is pretty awesome though!](https://i.imgur.com/jw8VsxY.jpg) It even has a HF blade to cut down Legion! It's perfect for Shin!   [All of Shin's superior officers have died](https://i.imgur.com/HSHwrmi.jpg) so he's the only one running his entire battalion right now? That's actually kinda badass. I am surprised that they didn't just put all of the Eight-Six into one special unit. Considering how high  their skills are individually compared to regular soldiers and officers  it makes sense to spread them out into different battalions.  Jesus fucking christ. One second we have [Eugene all happy and waving off to Shin](https://i.imgur.com/tjJ1ztg.jpg) and then we just hard cut [to Eugene's severed arm](https://i.imgur.com/cJr1IXR.jpg) in the battlefield holding his locket. Fuck. I really should've expected this but I guess this is a good reminder on how people [can die any time in this show](https://i.imgur.com/j6dg6hg.jpg) without any warning or fanfare.  It doesn't matter if it's at Republic of San Magnolia or the Federal Republic of Giad  [Shin will continue on with being The Reaper.](https://i.imgur.com/8bHI7lQ.jpg)  Looks like we are definitely back into full gear with our first death of this cour. :(
51,* Baldur's Gate series. In hindsight  while it brought in an era of deep  expansive  and engaging CRPGs  it does not need any remakes  other than making sure it can run on modern hardware. Beamdog's work on the EE versions are appreciated  though ultimately not necessary. * Planescape Torment. Still remains as one of the best stories and writing ever to grace the medium  barring Beamdog's EE version of it  needs no remake. It has shit combat and a stupid RPG ruleset  but the game isn't exactly about the mechanics. We have a true spiritual successor in the form of Disco Elysium (no  Numenera is no even remotely close)  and I feel that the genre should move forward instead of reviving old titles. * Diablo 2. Yes  it got remade. No  it did not needed a remake. Its mechanics are old and boring. They were awesome when they first came out  but since then games like Path of Exile and Grim Dawn have massively improved the formula. Diablo 2 is fun  and will always have a place in my heart  but no way in hell I'll buy a prettier version of it just to play the same old mechanics. * Fallout 1 and 2. With how few there are that remembers Fallout's isometric roots  and the dark humour in the first two games instead of the whimsical slapstick humour from Bethesda's interpretation of the Fallout franchise  I hope to god nobody goes back and turns Fallout 1 and 2 into something akin to Fallout 3/4. That would be a slaughter of my childhood. * Dark Sun: Shattered Lands. This was a great game when it was released  but was made using D&D 2 edition rules  which is pretty confusing if you're not from that era. It's one of the first RPGs with a strong storyline with multiple options to solve problems  and one of the first RPGs to have a strong open-world implementation in its era. Remaking this would not bring anything new to the genre  and players who never played the older gold box games will not understand the appeal of these games.

My name is BlackPenguin and Im back again with some seasonal anime reviews for the Summer 2021 Season. After watching 23 shows in the Spring  I reduced my Summer watchlist to paltry 16 shows. I had so much more free time!  My reviews can be found below starting with my Top 5 Anime of the season  my Top 5 OPs/EDs of the season  and then individual reviews for every show I watched  in order from highest to lowest rated (in my own humble opinion). I try to be as spoiler free as possible  & write in a style that is digestible for all audiences from otaku to anime newbie. I also wait until Ive watched the entirety of the show/cour  so as to give a complete picture of what I thought (hence why I do them after the season is over). I also give a synopsis for new shows.  I talk about things like plot structure  themes  character progression  the major tones or emotions of a show  & early developments. But no specifics on major plot points  character events  endgames  outcomes of final battles  or anything that would steal the majority of your enjoyment away. So someone who hasnt seen the show *should* be able to read the review without issue. And if anything *is* potentially spoilery  I always give a warning. But please keep in mind that when reviewing a *returning* show  I may spoil its *previous* season/cour.  So  give them a read if youd like!

57,**Atelier Iris 3: Grand Phantasm**  this game has probably one of the best turn based combat systems I've ever seen. Turn based combat with turn order displayed on a gauge  shared skill points for activating spells and abilities  elemental/damage type weaknesses are displayed when selecting the enemy  all skills list their damage type and or element  crowd control abilities  turn order manipulation  healing and damage over time abilities  a class system  a fun crafting system it seriously has nearly everything I want in a turn based game.   The story is totally ho hum though and some of the character designs are cool others are bizarrely oversexualized in generic JRPG fashion. I've heard they abandoned this combat system and returned to whatever it is they did before the Iris system because their Japanese fanbase didn't like it  which is a damned shame.
58,**Content warning:** spree shooting  suicide  violence.  I finally finished my free  system-neutral horror scenario called [Logomancy](https://kidminotaur.com/logomancy-67faf7bc878d) (first mentioned around these parts [several years ago](https://www.reddit.com/r/rpg/comments/5wog9h/comment/dec93f9/?utm_source=reddit&utm_medium=web2x&context=3)). I originally ran this with Delta Green  but you could use it with Call of Cthulhu  Cthulhu Dark  a generic/universal system  etc.  The gist: A new roleplaying game that contains a magical language that drives people mad  not unlike the *King in Yellow*. The PCs need to find out what's going on and find the source of the game before more people get hurt.  The scenario includes a micro-game designed to be used as an in-game handout. The PCs could actually play this game as a game within a game.  It's pretty short and would work well as a one-shot.  Let me know what you think.
59,**Context and prior experience** : I'm male in my late 20's  living in my 4th country in 6 years. I was born in America  but speak 3 languages  and am working on a PhD in physics (quantum and nonlinear optics). In high school a friend and I made a few games in ADA  and also ported basically all of OpenGL into ADA and made probably the worst graphics rendering engine on the planet. I also made a few other games in java  game maker  etc... But in general have been programming for nearly all my life.  **The Game** : I'm making a video game called hive-defender ([hive-defender.com](https://hive-defender.com))  which is a fast-paced strategy-shooterthat takes place in a procedurally-generatedand fully-destructible labyrinth. You customize and control 4 alien swarms simultaneously  and defend your home from would-be human invaders! You can play alone  or play online with a friend  and defend your hive together.  **State of the Project** : Currently the single player portion of the game is basically feature complete and ready to go. Which means that right now  I'm working on final polish and balancing   I have 24/36 unlock aesthetic choices ready to go  and 39/39  perks ready to go  and have even done a few optimization patches - but of course there's always some bug fixing and edge cases that need to be dealt with.  **Immediate Goals** : I was accepted into a game incubator ran by the country I live in  and part of that means that I need to form a limited liability company  and get prepared to pitch the project to a panel of investors and publishers. That means a bunch of boring work  but also that I need to gather metrics which I can use to validate the market viability of the project to the potential partners. To that end  I'm working on a public demo that I'll release on itch  and at the same time (for wishlist purposes)  will be releasing a steam page.  **How it's Going** : Well I have a discord  and a dev-build that people can play. Generally  it seems like people like the game  and that's good. On the other hand  it's pretty overwhelming for a lot of people given that it's really very hard to control all 4 swarms independently! Although maybe  that's kind of the intention? I am having some issues with the visuals though. It seems like people aren't just overwhelmed by the visuals of the game. There's a lot going on - visually speaking  and this has been a harder problem to address. I personally don't have a problem with it at all  so it's difficult to understand where people are coming from.  **Long Term Goals** : So obviously I need to introduce multiplayer in the game. I think there will be some challenges  but in general  I plan to run private  co-op servers  using some unity-built plug-ins. One person will host  and the other will join in. Everything will be run on the host's computer  and his job will be to send the game state to others  and control swarms 1&2  and listen to commands from the guest (who controls swarms 3 & 4). And of cours

I'm just some guy on the internet who has been following intellectual property law as an interested layman for the last few decades.  If you want a real answer  put some money on the table and hire a lawyer who knows your local laws and specializes in IP law.  &#x200B;  Actual game mechanics (e.g.  the process of rolling 1d20  adding modifiers  and comparing it to a target number) are not copyrightable.  What *is* copyrightable is the prose used to explain those mechanics.  In practical terms  what that means is that you can't copy their text word-for-word without their explicit permission (a license).  There's also a ""derivative works"" clause which means you can't rewrite their prose in your own words.  Even if you're expressing the same ideas or mechanics  the expression must be your own.  The reason you see so many word-for-word copies of the D&D 3.x rules running around is because of the OGL  which basically allowed authors to use most (but not quite all) of the text of the original publisher's rulebooks  provided they followed certain requirements when doing so.  &#x200B;  You may also want to do some web searches for why Kevin Crawford chose not to use the OGL for Stars Without Number.  His answers are basically consistent with what I said above (in summary  ""I didn't need the OGL because I wrote it all myself"")  but he's looked into this a lot more closely and carefully than I have  so he may nail some nuances that I've missed here."
61,"**Divinity**  as a whole  is my favorite series.  The world of Rivellon has a storied and rich history spanning more than 14 000 years. It experienced the rise and fall of not only civilizations  but races as well. The Eternals  now seen by modern Rivellonians as gods  rose to acquire and manipulate the power of Source  and although many of the ancients proved that they had an aptitude for it  eight rose to become masters of the Source when they dared to create mortals in their own image. These ""gods"" and their subjects would meddle with the world's history for all time.  Most people only think of the darling  Original Sin 2 when someone mentions Divinity  but the world has a long  intertwining history built up over the course of Dragon Commander  the first Original Sin  Divine Divinity  and Beyond Divinity before the events of Original Sin 2 even came to pass  with Divinity II taking place just 60 years after Original Sin 2 as the last chronological game in the series.  As thrilled as I am that Divinity finally caught on after 20 years of existence  it always makes me sad to know that most people have never experienced the rest of what Rivellon has had to offer. I try not to be a hipster about video games and I do take pride in having been there since the beginning  but I don't gatekeep and I strongly encourage and welcome anyone with the means (aka a PC) to play every game in the series in chronological order.  The continuity in the series is outstanding and it's almost impossible to find a more consistent and yet varied series."
62,"**For First-timers:**  Whenever a new Lupin III series comes out  of course some people are going to ask/wonder: do I need to have seen any of the other Lupin III franchise before watching this?  &nbsp;  **Short Answer: No.** Every Lupin III series is standalone  you'll have no problems starting here.  &nbsp;  **Long Answer:** Still **no**  you'll absolutely be fine watching this on its own. But you may wish to know that recent modern Lupin series have had a lot of fun referencing past series or having characters from past series make minor appearances. Of course  if you've seen all the past series this can add a lot of fun and enjoyment to the viewing experience  but it's certainly not necessary. For example  the last arc of Part V had callbacks to certain characters/items from several of the movies/TV specials - if you recognized them you were like ""OMG it's the _____ from ______!"" but it was still perfectly understandable for those who had never seen those before. Heck  often-times a character gets introduced who has history with Lupin as if they were some character from a past series... and they're not  it's a completely original intro. So don't worry about it  you'll be fine.  All that said... yes  this Albert guy is from a past series - Part V  specifically. All you need to know is exactly what they said in this episode - he's a former partner of Lupin III who now works as a spy for the French government. If any other past characters show up in a way that's important to the story  you can be sure any past context necessary for this story will be explained at that time  too.  (And if someone references Rebecca  just know that she's best girl.)"
63,**Grim Dawn** is my favorite ARPG.  As far as builds go  you combine two classes and can progress in either of them  allowing for a pretty staggering amount of build possibilities.  In addition  much like Path of Exile's passive web  you are able to progress in and complete Constellations (eg The Throne) that give you passive benefits and procs that you can tie to skills.  You unlock Constellation nodes by restoring shrines in the world  which can take you to some pretty out of the way places.  To secret places.
64,**How** are you making your game? You can start with what you know as a web developer: just javascript and HTML will do for a simple game.           function update() {          // your update logic here      }        function render() {          // your render logic here      }      let currentFrameId = 0;      function loop(frameId) {          update();          render();            currentFrameId = window.requestAnimationFrame(loop);      }  here you have the most basic game loop in javascript. There's no input handling because you'll bind listeners to whatever ui element you like.   Start with this and build something simple  then add a delta time to the update function  and go on from that.   After that you can bring in a library like Phaser and familiarize with more specific game dev concepts.
65,**Modern Superhero game.**  What are some things I can have this cult do that appear on the surface to be Good but once you start digging you find out they are actually evil?  Like they went and volunteered at the Animal rescue.  2 days later all the animals are dead.  **Edit:** They are supposedly helping People get their lives under control.  Mainly focusing on 18-30 crowd.  one of the things they do for these people is have them volunteer in the community.  CLean Cut and extremely helpful.
66,"**Mutant Year Zero** would be my pick.  Its weird enough to give players some coool ideas and it generates the whole ""GM actions"" for you  As a GM you just pick up the book and follow the steps outlined and BAM! you suddenly realise you have an adventure ready to go.   Also the mechanics are very easy to explain to a player. You simply roll as many dice as you have in your stat+skill+gear.  Thats it."
67,**Parasite Eve** has an excuse for like a real-time movement tactical grid battle system.  Its not fully baked  but  combined with the weird weapon upgrade/attribute system  it gives A VERY UNUSUAL and INTERESTING feel to the game that also meshes well with the unusual setting (modern day New York City and dark sci-fi/horror adventure).  **Suikoden 2** is great and leisurely and the team/friend Combo Move system is fun and very easy  theres no limit or mana points.  Uh **Lufia 2** has a weird combat/dungeon mechanic thing.  **Mother 3** has rhythm button battle moves  so then of course some enemy music is rhythmically confusing  and then of course theres a special ability that lets you hear the pulse of the music more easily to do the big damage rhythm combo.  The **FFV** Jobs system is in fact as cool and great as everyone claimed it was.  Its better than both FF6s Espers and FF7s Materia.
68,**Ram**  A barebone Debian with SMB shares need around 300 to 500 MiB ram I believe. Something along that line. You want more ram if you reopen small files over and over again quickly. Or making tons of quick writes.    Also useful if you want other services to run. Torrent client  media server to watch movies outside the house (Jellyfin)  checking for new episodes or movies  automatically torrent or newsgroup fetcher etc.  **CPU**  Even a modern i3 will be plenty for most home storage system  even if you use encryption and compression. If it has an intel iGPU it can also transcode a couple of movie at the same time for live watching in different resolution / bitrates / containers.  **HDDs**  Well that just depends on how much storage  speed  redundancy you want to have.  &#x200B;  So yeah  just for transferring 2x 33mbit/s a pi is plenty good. If you want to step up a bit a entry level Intel fromt he last few years with iGPU can handle even more. Encryption  live compression and hardware transcoding. Put in a single 8GB stick and you are golden. Makes it easy to upgrade at a later time.
69,**The Problem:**  I would like to boot into BIOS to install an update from a USB drive and change the voltage settings to my RAM  however when I try to boot into bios  either from UEFI mode in Windows  or by spamming the delete key  I am met with a blank display. *I BELIEVE* the issue started when I enabled a setting that was supposed to allow me to boot into BIOS by holding the power button down for a certain amount of time. There is no button to simply flash an update from the USB drive I have to be inside BIOS to do it.  **What I've tried:**  * Resetting the CMOS by removing the battery and shorting the jumper pins. DIDNT WORK. * Rebooting to UEFI mode within windows advanced recovery settings. DIDNT WORK. * Switching outputs from DP cable from GPU to HDMI cable from Mobo. I thought maybe the GPU just wasn't outputting during the boot sequence but this didn't work either. * Disabling FAST BOOT within Windows Power settings. DIDNT WORK.  **PC Specs:**  * Intel i7-10700k CPU * Corsair Vengeance DDR4 16gb RAM (at around 2.4k mhz atm I want to boost to 3k) * EVGA GTX 1080 Hybrid * MSI MPG z490 Gaming Edge Wifi motherboard. * Outputting to LG 27GL850 and AOC G2770 monitors. * OS is Windows 10 Pro * Storage: 1TB Samsung 970 Evo SSD  Any help with this issue is greatly appreciated. I will go back to Google/Forums in the meantime.  &#x200B;  **SOLVED:**  The issue **in my case** was something with the firmware on my DP ports on my NVIDIA Graphics card.  Running [this updater](https://www.nvidia.com/en-us/drivers/nv-uefi-update-x64/) from Nvidia solved my issue and I can now display BIOS on my main monitor without having to use an HDMI cable to my secondary monitor.     &#x200B;

71,"**Track stuff**  1. Learn the flags  watch the flag stations.  Always know where the next tower is  you never know when there's going to be an emergency or some other reason they're passing information. 2. Learn the hand signals and passing etiquette.  Point by on the appropriate side (passer goes off-line).  If someone is faster than you  let them pass - if you're about to enter a technical section and the pass isn't going to be for a couple turns  the ""i see you there"" signal is appropriate. 3. 100mph on track feels way faster than any sort of sim racing.  There is some carryover  but learning to feel the physics in your own car is far more immersive than even the best sims.  Basic line is all you're really going to carry over  and even then in person you're probably going to have a tendency to brake too early and turn in too soon. 4. Tap the brakes at about the halfway point of any flat-out straight.  Better to find out you have no brakes there and start thinking about how youre going to slow down than to find out going triple digits into a braking zone.  **Prep stuff**  1. Make sure you have appropriate brake pads and fresh fluid.  Nothing ruins your fun like the brake pedal going to the floor.  Pro-tip: the pads in your OE Brembos on your Camaro are better than nothing  but probably still trash.  That said  you don't have to break the bank - something like StopTech ""Sport"" brake pads will hold up to most power levels and tire compounds and are generally under $150 for all 4 corners on most cars. 2. Appropriate tires are a must too.  All seasons *will* chunk on you if you're moderately fast.  You dont need ST-class autocross spec tires  but I wouldnt do a track day and expect to run full sessions on anything less than a UHP Summer. 3. If you havent changed it in a while (3 months)  fresh oil before the track day.  If you have  still consider changing it after.  Judging by your cars  Im guessing you're American.  Unless you're just going to an open track day  most track organizations are going to have you in the novice group with a mandatory instructor for all sessions (maybe solo the last 2 over a full weekend IME) and at least an hour worth of classroom time throughout the day.  Listen to your instructor and pay attention in the classroom.  Safety and learning are much more important than being fast."

73,**Wrath of the Righteous**. It's buggy in parts but storywise I feel like it's one of the best CRPGs of the last couple of decades. Probably worth waiting a few months on if you're bug averse but I was shocked by how enjoyable I found it  it feels like playing BG2 for the first time.

76,*Burn Bryte* is an RPG made specifically for roll20. There's nothing *specifically* about it that requires a VTT  but it has a lot of dice and exploding-dice mechanics.    *Lancer* says in its corebook that it helps to have the COMPCON character builder and encounter builder. It also probably plays better on a VTT than a regular tabletop.    *this discord has ghosts in it* expects a discord server.    *Alice is Missing* come either in physical form with cards  or as a roll20 setup or discord bot setup.

78,*foil hat theory*  they are doing the remasters to test them on new systems like they did the first time with GTA5 and then came out with RDR2.  Except this time we are getting this trilogy and GTA5 (again) on the nex gen consoles because GTA 6 is coming AND GTA online will be a stand alone game incorporating all the maps from the previous games in one GTA online world.

85,.... didn't we just have a shit slinging session on the Integra literally an hour ago  and now it's the best thing ever? I'm not trying to shit on the Integra  and I'm actually quite interested in seeing how it turns out (especially if it got SH-AWD + 6MT) but this sub swings wildly between approval and burn-them-at-the-stake sometimes.
86,"[**Legend of Mana**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e0fXVsFhEug&ab_channel=SquareEnix) just got a remaster. It's an extremely faithful recreation of the original  which *definitely* went under the radar when it was initially released. Most of the changes are visual (updated background art and stuff)  translation and QoL improvements. Mechanically  it's pretty much identical to the original PS1 game  which means there are some aspects of the mechanics that feel a bit dated  but I still love them (though I'm biased  because this is the game that got me into gaming as a kid  so I'll happily admit that I love it probably too much  lol).  For what it's worth  by the way  I'm not really a JRPG person  so LoM is the only proper JRPG on this list. The rest are made by western studios  if that matters. And are mostly indie of various levels.  [**Greedfall**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PmqWaDwKS6M&ab_channel=PlayStation) is another one that I think a lot of people missed. It's a much more recent action RPG clearly inspired by games like Dragon Age. I would call it ""extremely ambitious"" - the development studio basically tried to make something at the scale of Dragon Age: Inquisition  but with a studio team that's like 1/10th the size. I think they did a pretty good job  but it's admittedly a bit janky in places.   I'm not sure if [**Transistor**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pJmtn6JP7Ug&ab_channel=GameSpot) counts as an RPG - you don't really *level up*  exactly  but you do collect new abilities over the course of the game (which can also be used to improve existing ones). It's stylish as hell  not terribly expensive and not terribly long  so it might be worth the risk?  [**Omensight**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8oGSeHFuY7g&ab_channel=Nintendo) is a really awesome game about repeating the last day of existence before the apocalypse  learning about the events leading up to it and eventually - hopefully - preventing it from happening. It's another one that feels a little less like a typical RPG  but is still worth looking into  especially for the super unique investigation mechanics.  [**Boyfriend Dungeon**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uu9BXqm3eKI&ab_channel=Nintendo) is a fairly recent release with a hilarious premise. Basically you find weapons in dungeons  but outside the dungeon the weapons turn into people for you to then date. Fighting with them levels them up  which then unlocks new dates  which unlocks new abilities  so you can level them up some more.

87,"[*Hmm  yeah  no way*](https://i.imgur.com/SxZ10Cj.png)  I don't believe for a second that Lily will turn out to be Lupin's daughter if that's what they are hoping to imply here. But obviously Lupin has some hardcore history with both Holmes and Lily. I'm gonna guess that Lily is [a certain John Watson's daughter](https://i.imgur.com/mQrvT1x.png)  Watson died some years ago  and Lupin didn't actually kill Watson but they all believe that he did. Holmes' legendary days as a great detective were back when Watson and Holmes were a duo  but Watson's passing was hard on Holmes and he's been in a bit of a emotional/motivational rut since then.   If that all ends up being true  awesome  I like that as a new-ish take on the character. To be honest  I was not very excited for Sherlock being in this season as that character has been done to death and I didn't feel like it would really add much to Lupin III. But having him be *not* the top-of-his-game legendary bachelor detective with partner Watson we're all accustomed to and instead be an after-things-went-sharky post-prime Holmes has the potential to be much more interesting.  (Though I'm still waiting for the return of [perfect detective Akechi Holmes](https://i.imgur.com/JMLPMLt.png) and his trio.)  Anyways  great setup episode for the season (or for the first main arc of the season  we'll see). Looks like we're going to have a pretty complex setup - Raven as the eventual antagonist hiding in the shadows for now and Holmes/Lily as the ""guest main characters"" (like Rebecca/Nyx were in part IV or Albert/Ami were in part V) that get a whole story of their own  but we've also got 3 separate police forces in Scotland Yard+Lestrade  MI6+Buckingham  and Zenigata+Oscar. Albert might've been a one-episode appearance just to help establish Lupin's motives and disappear or he might keep showing up  too. Looks like it'll be an intricate story  I'm excited.  The only thing I didn't fully like was that in the car chase scene things felt a bit too weightless/impactless for me. I don't think it's because of the 3D on the cards  particularly  just how they've moved and shot things. Hard to put my finger on exactly what makes it feel that way  but it just does to me. I even went back and rewatched some bits of part III and IV to compare and yeah  I'm not imagining a difference.  Also  I find it hilarious how gun-crazy Scotland Yard is here  shooting up the streets with civilians present  shooting through the smoke grenade  etc. Who knew London was the new Philadelphia."

""At least in the narrow sense that we have been able to build structures that fall with more stable trajectories and at slower terminal velocities than equivalent seeds that you would see from plants or trees.""   solar panels beat nature in converting sunlight into electricity  too :p   nature isn't trying for stable trajectories or time in flight... nature is trying to spread seeds."
114,> Are people actually expecting the entire Zen 3 line to come out with 192MB of L3 just because die stacking is a thing?  No  theyre expecting the ryzen 5/7  refresh (6/8 cores) to come with 96MB of cache   and the ryzen 9 refresh (12/16 cores) to come with 192MB of cache.  > To me  in a silicon shortage  192MB of L3 even for a 5900X seems pie in the sky  let alone for the entire range... so is there another source people are getting this idea from?  People are making an assumption/guess that the entire zen3 desktop range will be refreshed with vcache as zen3+. This has not been confirmed. But if you assume that to be true  then the cache amounts are obvious  just based on how the silicon works. All zen 3 cpus with*out* integrated graphics are built using an IO die   and 1 or more CCD chips which has a single CCX consisting of 8 cores and 32MB of cache on it. The 5600x and 5800[x] have 1 ccd (With 2 cores disabled on the 5600x) and so have 32 mb of l3 cache  and the 5900[x]   and 5950x have 2 CCDs (With 2 Cores per CCD disabled on the 5900[x])  which gives them 64MB of cache. The way vcache works is by adding a single (For now) 64MB cache die on top of each CCD  tripling the cache from 32MB per CCD to 96MB per CCD. So then the single CCD chips (5600x and 5800[x] successors) would have 96MB of cache  and the dual CCD chips (5900[x] and 5950x successors) would have 192 MB cache.
115,> Are people actually expecting the entire Zen 3 line to come out with 192MB of L3 just because die stacking is a thing?  Where'd you pull that from? No one but crazy people are expecting the entire product range to feature 192MB's of additional cache per CCD. The low end of the product range will have 64MB's of V-Cache  plus the default 32MB which makes a total 96MB's of cache per CCD.
116,> Are we at a huge disadvantage?   The only disadvantage (as far as technical knowledge) is that youre in-charge of your own learning/curriculum. CS degrees typically cover a broad base of things  but theres no reason you cant learn those things yourself.   When it comes to being self taught the main thing youll have to figure out is whether you want to create your own structured learning path or go about it totally unstructured.   > Does previous intricate knowledge of a certain programming language/engine taught via a college course benefit development to a huge extent?  What are we comparing here though? Regardless of if youre self taught or learnt through college  if you have an intricate knowledge of the languages/engine you use then that will benefit you greatly if what youre doing can leverage that pre-existing knowledge. But where or how you learn the skill is irrelevant.   Also at least to my understanding college doesnt really do a deep dive into languages. Youre expected to learn and be able to use the technology  but youre not going to get taught all the ins and outs of it. e.g. if youre taking a class that uses C  youre not going to come out of it with a complete understanding of the standard  knowledge of how to write the most performant code  what quirks exist in the language  etc. Any students that do  likely is because they decided to learn that on their own.

Jujutsu and Tokyo Revengers having similar art styles means that all manga now have similar art styles?  > The scene happens before or after something important  just because of Humor or - in a very specific and rare occasion - it has motives Inside of the story  By that logic  the part in Fire Force where Shinra fights Rekka and it immediately segues into him accidentally groping Tamaki is a-ok  because its funny - even if it doesnt match the tone before.   > Why are so many people saying ""I hate ecchi scenes... in a Shonen""  I mean... it is ok to say that  But a Shonen is boy's maganize soooo it's kinda logic that... it would have some ecchi  There are tons of shonen series which *dont* have ecchi  though. Just because a series **can** have it  doesnt mean it **should**.   > Ignore the proportions/ecchi if you don't like  the story is the main point of basically any manga. If there is a ecchi scene just skip  you... wouldn't lose something  What if ecchi scenes pop up at random  with no indication of if the scenes will actually be important? Like  Mushoku was disliked because people were blindsided by the ecchi - its not like there was some trigger warning before that would notify people to skip it.   > Also  when there is mangas that have their own art  or they are Overcharged (jojo's part 8 - or any other part without having a physical volume is hard to follow - and Hunters Guild: Red Hood) or they are extremly simple (Noragami) but good enough...

I think this guy is onto something with armchair developers on Reddit not being worth listening to."
122,"> Games like ""Baldur's gate"" feel too old for me. I would prefer these games to have a good story  that I could influence with my choices  Planescape torment comes from the era of baldurs gate but it has an excellent story and fits most of your criteria. You may also want to check out some of the tales games  such as symphonia or vesperia  they have pretty cool companions.  Give the gothic games a try  you can probably run all of them  they're not really strong in terms of companions but your choices do matter and the style of the games haven't really been replicated by any other games aside from elex. Speaking of which if you can handle elex then play that instead  its essentially a modern gothic experience.  One I don't see many people mention before is Two worlds 2  it's essentially an inferior bethesda game but honestly very fun if you can get over the comparisons.  Alpha protocol is an action rpg set in modern times  with lots of different choices and such.  Way of the samurai is another good action rpg with a LOT of endings and choices  again not much in the way of permenant companions though.  Kingdoms of amular may be worth checking out  but even with the rerelease it's a very easy game  but there is some fun to be had.  Not quite sure if your laptop can handle dragons dogma  but check it out regardless  action rpg with a strong (or weak depending on how you see it) emphasis on created companion characters.  Give the shadowrun games a go  they're all good crpgs that you can run.  Age of decadence is a great crpg whose story drastically changes depending on your build  it's very much a ""play it your way"" kinda game.  Wasteland 2 is a decent one though it can be a hit or a miss depending on your tastes.  Tale of Wuxia  now be warned  this is a chinese game with TERRIBLE translation  but if you can get over that it's an extremely fun crpg with lots of story and build choices with strong companions and lots of endings. Another warning the game works on a time system  if you are not efficient (or following a guide) you can and will fail the entire playthrough. Think of it like a much much harsher version of personas system. Thankfully though it has enough build variation that it doesnt get boring.  And thats that. Trust me when I say there is always another good crpg to play  even with older systems (I should know)."
123,> How big should the individual spirite be?   It depends on what resolution you are supporting and how big sprites are meant to be in your game (compared to the entire screen). Personally in my game humanoid sprites are [this size](https://puu.sh/Ii73C/69f9dbc648.png) and it's only this large in 4k (which is highest I am going with). Scaling things down works reasonably well if you don't overdo it - eg. going from 600x600 at 4k to 400x400 (2560x1440)  300x300 (aka to 1920x1080) or even 200x200 (1280x720) is fine. But if you try like 32x32 it's going to look like crap (you lose too much information by going this small).  So pretty much make a tiny game  place a camera  put a rectangle for your sprite and figure out how large you want that rectangle to be. That's how you determine what resolutions assets should be.
124,> I am also of the mind that many a times  CG really ruins anime  but not this time  in fact  I would argue the opposite!  I do agree that the CGI in this anime was by no means bad  but I dont think the CGI added anything to it.
125,> I find that often you don't need to improve your technical ability  like drawing or sculpting to make more appealing art.  It's a common misconception. You need a lot of technical knowledge. I recommend reading the first few pages of ***Animators survival kit by Richard Williams***. He basically said even if you are drawing cartoons you still need a good understanding of fundamentals In order to break them.  Plus there is nothing as style. Pro artist have a bunch of different style  its about adaptability and speed.  > It boils down very much to things like picking better colors and learning about composition.  It's sound simple but it's not. Design and design theory is a beast in itself. one need a lot of experience to nail it down. Not to mention designs need to be unique and catchy. And work well.  - **Can you sell games with bad art?**  Yes. But Chance of someone picking it up is low.  - **Do pro artist cheat and trace?**  I won't call it a cheating but yes pro artist trace to speed up there workflow. But this don't mean they just trace. You still need the fundamentals down to trace. (I have seen some bad trace attempts)  - **Do I need to memories every inch of human skin?**  No  you can get started with drawing simple character or pixel art or low poly  The thing is the more you put in better you get and higher your chance of success. I have meet artist who are not super good at art but still make a good amount of money. Sometimes its about speed and expectations.  I have experience in fine art and currently learning graphic design. I won't say I'm a professional but I have done some commission work in the past.
126,> I love the lore and politics of Vampire: The Masquerade  but I'm super not interested in the sexual nature of the whole game  I don't think I've ever had any sexual themes in the game when playing Vampire. There's nothing inherently sexual about it  though I could totally see some groups playing it like that.
127,> I used to run a discord server for the game  and earlier this year I decided to retire it due to it taking a massive toll on my personal life and my mental health.  You should have just left it to the fans to manage the discord - why the need to retire it - simply stating that you don't have the time anymore to manage it.
128,> If that grid is evenly spaced as described in the article  it's impossible for every other clump to match it.  I think you're assuming that each grid cell contains only one clump of grass  but I don't see why that must be true?  Also  since it's a 2D axis-aligned grid  you can use integer division to slot grass positions into the grid (`column = (x - grid_top_left.x) // 2` for 2 m cells).
129,> I'm 49 and I find it very hard to find gamers to bolster our dwindling group of gamers.  In my own age group - yeah  it's hard. So I play with younger crowd  sometimes with kids and family. This makes me GM more often then not  but I like it like that.   Still - not the same as playing with people that have the same experience and age  but A LOT of fun. Especially kids can surprise you  they are a sneaky bunch. Must be after their mother  yes? ;D
130,> In a game engine like Unity  you could probably just set the Time scale to 40  but I think that can only get you so far before you run into problems where the reduced number of Updates have concrete impact on behavior.   You might want to put the game simulation in fixed timesteps. Then instead of making each simulation step longer  you can make more of the smaller steps.  From timescale docs in Unity:  > How often MonoBehaviour.FixedUpdate is executed per frame depends on the timeScale. Therefore  to keep the number of FixedUpdate callbacks per frame constant  you must also multiply Time.fixedDeltaTime by timeScale. Whether this adjustment is desirable is game-specific.
131,> In addition to phones  the rules will apply to other devices like tablets  headphones  portable speakers  videogame consoles  and cameras. Manufacturers will also be forced to make their fast-charging standards interoperable  and to provide information to customers about what charging standards their device supports. Under the proposal  customers will be able to buy new devices without an included charger.  Edit: From [their Q&A page:](https://ec.europa.eu/commission/presscorner/detail/en/QANDA_21_4614)  > **Why are other devices not included in the scope of the proposal?**  > The products covered by the Commission's proposal are among the most used by a large group of consumers and share similar charging characteristics. Other products such as earbuds  smart-watches and fitness trackers were not considered for technical reasons linked to their size  use conditions  etc. The products concerned by the amendment to the Radio Equipment Directive were identified as having a strong potential to integrate the common charging solution and to secure the biggest benefits for consumers and the environment.
132,"> It boils down very much to things like picking better colors and learning about composition.  I disagree. Let's say you want to draw a character. If your anatomy sucks - you can't draw humans. Period. If you can't imagine them in different perspectives - you can't properly draw  say  a dialogue with them. If you lack mental library of outfits/fashion/historical references - you will have a very hard time coming with a cool design.   Art is an acquired skill that takes many years to reach a sufficient level. I mean - just in order to get accepted into a decent Fine Arts university you already have to put a lot of hours practicing it.  And if you do go to say university you will quickly find out that ""better colors and composition"" alone are not going to cut it. You will be told to bring 100 sketches a week. You will be having live drawing classes to level up your anatomy  be told to take a specific newspaper article and transform that into a comic to work on your imagination  study cavemen art  discuss characters designs and how important silhouettes are (and how much you can tell JUST from the shape of the character)  how to intentionally make ugly characters (and then discuss what makes them ugly) and so on and on.   Of course it does depend on what are your expectations. It is possible to make a video game without substantial art skills. But it certainly limits your options and I doubt you will be making  say  something resembling next Ori and the Blind Forest or Cuphead. Personally I don't think I am the worst artist around but I am still only at a hobbyist level. And so I found it much cheaper and effective to hire a professional artist to help me out with my game rather than attempt to reach such level myself  it's just way too much of a gap (both in terms of skill and time) to make something visually appealing to me."
133,> looked like a cool and special show  Sounds like you were probably sold before you posted. It's an accessible show while also being enjoyable on deeper levels if that's your thing  and I'd say it's more informed by live-action conventions than anime ones (contrary to another comment about it having a western style). The animation and music are consistently high quality  the dialogue's generally subtle  and it stars some of the best voice actors Japan has to offer  so you'd be off to a good start all round.
134,> Pick your dev tools  language  engine once. NEVER change them  > I code in C++ using visual studio. I coded my own engine. I have not changed this. Ever. Not in twenty years. Why would I? What do you see in indie strategy games that I cannot do using this development environment? Almost all indies chop and change languages  IDEs and engines like they are changing clothes. This is utter  utter madness. You do NOT need the features in the latest shiny engine  and you NEVER will. If you must use something like Unity  pick a version and never  ever change. Not for the new shiny thing  no matter how shiny  not for all the talk of better productivity. Its all bullshit  and it will waste your time and cause you stress.  > When I edit the csv files for Democracy 4 I use my copy of office 2010. I have not upgraded  nor will I ever do so. I can do everything in Excel 2010. I will not upgrade from Visual Studio 2013. When I tell people this  I get angry tirades from people calling me stupid  and telling me that clearly they are using much more productive tools than me.  > **None of those people ever seem to ship anything.**  > Do NOT upgrade your tools  do not upgrade your dev PC. Get everything sorted  start your games development  and touch NOTHING until a year after you have shipped your game and support has dwindled.  I like the bold part (the author made it bold too). As if it's the most important thing to ship something before you can rightfully call it stupid.

137,> The isolators are around 110-150nm wide  so yes  on a 0.64m pixel that is actually quite a percentage unless they've shrunk things down even more on newer generation sensors. I don't think anybody expects the binned FWC to be similar to a larger pixel.  From /u/andreif in the AT comments regarding area lost to separating the pixels on such a dense array.  Honestly not very hyped about the Smartphone megapixel wars if the price is that high on the sensor area. Unless Samsung cooks up a terrific software solution  the sensor compromise on the Mi 11 sounds more reasonable to me in general.
138,> This is coming from a Disco Elysium fan btw so my expectations are pretty high.  Well  it's not Disco Elysium. No other game is  so you'll be disappointed it seems. Does that answer your question?  Otherwise  I'm quite enjoying Gamedec - it's more of an adventure game than proper RPG  but solving the quests was quite interesting. The writing isn't great  but just visiting the places is interesting enough  especially considering the rather low price of admission for the game.

140,"> Web is so much easier to get into and make a career with. Working on a game makes me feel like a total failure.  No one will think less of you if you just be a web developer and get paid a decent (or a lot?  I assume you can get paid well as a web dev) amount of money.   >I have an insane amount of respect for anyone who can complete even the most basic game. This shit is hard.  I'm glad you have a new found respect for devs.  Though if you really want to make games  you'd need to reevaluate how you approached this. ""I'm just going to program some shit?""  vs. ""I am watching youtube tutorials"" to ""I took courses.""  And all of those are perfectly fine  but if you really want to make a game  consider the scale of your project (start with tic tac toe or something like that)  get more tutorials and try to start from scratch.  Are you using engines or starting from actually scratch?  Like all of these things will change the difficulty (But it's still hard)  Game dev is NOT easy  it's why so many people try and fail  and even those who publish games  produce weak games  and even if they don't  they still don't make money... because buddy  you haven't really hit the ""hard"" part of game dev.  It's either polishing the game  or marketting it  both are complete nightmares.   But I do mean what I said before.  ""Give it up if you don't like it.""  It's perfectly fine to know your limits  or just enjoy games.  PS. Elsewhere you're talking about idle games  those are perfect to tackle  though very hard to master (and balance)...  BuT there's a fantastic channel with a series of incremental tutorials  check out https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCkLwnsfHtk_JAfhD8mSf0gg  . He uses Unity and will walk you through his process.

141,"> What are the best means for finding others?   Leaving advertisements on /r/gamedevclassifieds  /r/inat  LinkedIn etc. If you are paying then you get A LOT of responses. Eg. when I looked for a character artist I got over 100. Animators are a bit harder to come across but I still had a dozen or so candidates in few days. You can find surprisingly skilled artists for $15-20/hour  especially if you look for candidates outside of first world countries. Some artists will be even willing to drop their rates a bit if you are offering full time employment.   Personally I probably wouldn't hire a music composer full time however. Realistically speaking it's unlikely you will ever need more than 1-2 hours of OST in most video games. Whereas a decent composer can make a minute per day so they will most likely be done with your project in less than 3 months. Plus you only need music in later stages of a project - eg. when a given boss fight or area is done. So it's probably better to outsource it. Prices vary a far lot - some composers take as little as $50-60/minute of a track. Decent indie bands can ask for as much as $1000/minute (if you need a highly dynamic track with vocal). If you want a full fledged physical orchestra - this adds $2500-5000/hour (assuming you use a cheaper one  eg. from Hungary and not from USA).  If there are some pieces of advice I can recommend:  * first  try assembling your entire team (as far as full time employees go) in roughly same timezone. Also ensure their English speaking skills (or whatever other language you prefer) are decent enough. For a single background or character you can live with Google Translate but for a longer project this won't work at all. * don't be afraid of asking people to do a (paid) test. Be it a character  background assets  running animation or etc. You will find out that two artists with similar level of finished drawings can greatly vary in speed so a more experienced (and more costly one) may actually end up saving you money in the long run. With programmers it's a bit different and you go with usual interview process. Personally I am against testing random algorithms implementations but if you want I can give you a decent list of quick questions and some coding exercises that don't take long to do  aren't a binary ""you either have heard of this before and do it in 5 mins or never have and you will never finish it"" and actually ensure whoever you are hiring can code.  * ...don't be afraid to fire people. This one might sting a bit if you have never done it before but I specifically say that first month is a bit of a trial period. The problem with fully remote team is that you can't easily check on people. Personally I had to fire an otherwise a skilled artist because they often took 2-3 days to respond (during weekdays when they are supposed to be working) and they forgot to even say what they are working on (there's a general list of things you can work on more or less any order you want).  F"
142,> why invest in the lore  More lore is terrible.  Lore means irrelevant crap that somebody scribbled on a napkin.  Most games are bland and mediocre.  Do other things.  Games cant be anything.  If you dont like it  turn it off.  Unless youre carefully studying how bad it is.

145,">""You just weren't paying enough attention"".  People use that all the time  often to defend against a specific anime (I won't name it  but some people may know anyway  because it's so common  I see it all the time).   If the person who criticizes the anime made it obvious they weren't paying attention sure  but if you throw that out of the blue  that's a weird defense. Especially when people use it to defend anime that aren't all that deep  and wouldn't require much attention to get it in the first place.  >""There is X thing in the anime  yet you complain about Y?""  This one's not just an anime thing  people use that for everything (hell  the Game of thrones showrunners were notorious for using that as an atrocious defense of a scene of their show).  Things don't have to be consistent with **our world**  but they have to be consistent with their own.   That's why it's fine if someone can use a fireball in anime  even though you can't do that in real life; Because in a anime universe a fireball can exist. But the existence of the fireball doesn't mean everything else can now exist in this anime because it established that it's different from our world.   If something seemingly doesn't exist/work for the first 9 epsodes  then it can't exist in the 10th (unless there's a reason why it now exists  of course).  But often there's just no reason  and people will dismiss criticism as ""There's magic on this show  well this shouldn't exist either!"" like it's some gotcha.   It's not.  >""It's well animated!""  People use that all the time to argue against people criticizing anime with generic/garbage plot. Ok  it may be well animated  but it doesn't do anything about their criticism.   If someone says a book is terrible  will these people say ""But the letters are so pretty""? Or if they defended the anime with ""The OP's a banger""  will these people defend the book with ""The cover is pretty good""?   >""What  you want the MC to die?""  People often say that against plot armor criticism... This one really makes me roll my eyes.  No  I don't want the MC to die. I want the MC to live by using his abilities in a realistic way.   If some teenage nerd is surrounded by 1000 soldiers and kill them all with martial art somehow even though he never trained and has no special power  it's a shit plot. And I don't think the better version would be ""The MC dies""  I think the better version would be not to make 1000 soldiers want to kill the MC like that  so the author doesn't then have to rely on plot armor to make him live."

147,>Can I learn both in same time or better no?  If you need Python to pass  you may want to focus on that first. Once you know one programming language  it's easier to learn another. There's a big difference between Python and C#  though. In C#  you have to explicitly define the types of your variables before using them. We were taught Java in my time so it was easier for me to learn other statically typed languages like C++ and C#. Can't say about learning from dynamically typed to statically typed. I absolutely hated PHP and Javascript when I had to learn it for a course.  >Is Python that bad in GameDev?  I'm afraid so. There's a bunch of Python libraries for gamedev but they don't really get traction.  >What would You do if You were me?  Focus on Python but I'd learn to use C# on free time. This was how I was able to learn C++ during college even though it was no longer required. Was able to use it for visual simulation using OpenGL later on for a course. Lots of people were impressed by that. In your case  you could probably have a game project on the second year.

149,">Every single clump of grass has to be a separate entity  carrying a Flammable component  which would probably be a hit in performance (although the developer outlines a few ways to mitigate that later on)  There's a separate grid for grass.  To speculate  the grass is almost certainly an instanced render of quads.  So they at least have an array of their positions to pass to the gpu.  Adding a flammable flag per instance isn't going to be much of an impact.  He says the fire system works like this:  >>When a cell burns  it sends a Im on fire and I burn this much in this radius message down the game event pipeline. This event is caught by objects  AI and other game systems that are in that area. They react to this message their own specific ways. The AI freaks out  the flammable objects get damaged and eventually catch fire.  So for the 2d grass grid  it would need to know which instances are in each cell.  When a cell burns  it tells the fire system to start a fire at each of the world positions for the instances in that cell.  I think I'd also personally have a grass burn-rate variable per instance  so I could burn the clumps in each cell at different rates.  >The dev talks about setting the cells themselves on fire  so I don't know if there's some kind of actual matching with the physical grass -- more like ""there's grass roughly around here  and the fire will encompass it""  When he dynamically generates the grid  he's walking through each cell and making a list of all the grass clumps that are in it.  When you fire your flamethrower at a grass clump  the grid is created containing *all* of the grass in the area.  You start subtracting from the hit point variable of the cell that has the initial grass clump.  When it hits 0  it tells the fire particle emitter system to start rendering fire on the instances in that cell.  >Whenever an entity is damaged by fire  a grid is generated on the fly. Cells that catch fire become damagers themselves. Following this system  every new cell that gets damaged will generate a new grid  Only one grid is generated in a local area until the fire in it is extinguished.  When an object in a neighboring cell is damaged  it either already knows there's a grid active  or it can check ""is there a grid active with this cell""."
150,>However  the apparently silent linking from AppGallery to third-party app stores does introduce a genuine risk of device compromise.  0 respect for the article or investigation.  I have the P40 and P40 Pro and it clearly warns you that you are leaving the official app store and Huawei can't guarantee the legitimacy of an APK.  It's a pop up message that you have to confirm  just to get to the APK.  There's nothing silent about it.  Considering Huawei are converting to Harmony OS it makes no sense for them to update to Android 11 either.  It also boggles my mind that they are flaming Xiaomi for stealing data with....Google Analytics.     Xiaomi's OS uses a lot of apps to gain revenue and they need google analytics to track this.  A simple google search shows you this.
151,>I just killed the stag lord and I find to suddenly be handed a kingdom feels cheap at a lowly level 4 or so (I know people have been handed kingdoms for doing nothing in real life but that was usually through nepotism not as some stranger in the land which is the premise of the game's story) and totally ruins the spirit of adventure for me.  If it makes you feel any better at this point you're not given a kingdom but a barony consisting of a couple of villages and a whole lot of wildlands. That seems much more level appropriate.
152,">I wanted to know how much my game worth...  Only you can answer that question. Why? Cuz it's artistic. Someone may spend $14.99 on the game because it appeals to them. Someone else may only buy it when it hits $6.99 because it really doesn't.  Just like game Dev  they're so many things that need to be thought about when pricing an indie game. Game/publisher loyalty can have higher price points. But indie games  especially micro indies  have a lot more room at setting price points.  And there's also a *perceptual* price point. In one article they point out that pricing a game at $4.99 puts you in a group of tens of thousands of other games. So people looking at that price point think  ""it's just another $4.99 indie game"".  But pricing it at $9.99  perceptually speaking  people will believe it's an overall better game. And it better be.  Also they talk about cost analysis. In the price point examples given  $9.99 and $19.99  selling 100 000 copies at the lower price point is just the same as selling 50 000 at the higher price point  while looking at the short vs long term.  Maybe these articles will help you.

154,>if you have any advice on keeping your current game fresh and exiting for yourself as well as your players long term.  If you have players interested in long term stories that will unfold over 20+ sessions - constantly swapping systems  setting  and more is going to kill engagement outright.  If you have players that love learning new systems  telling new but short stories  and exploring lots of character concepts - this system dance will be really fun.  So the advice is: Find players who want this type of experience.  >Meanwhile  my players would just like to play characters they've made     see them develop and get stronger within an established framework  and    not constantly have to make new ones.  Your issue is what you want  and what your players want are fundamentally different.

155,">Im definitely going to miss it  but I know its time to let go.  My first car?  It wouldn't pass smog check.  And fixing it required more work that you can justify.  So I let it rot away behind my parents house for half a decade before my Dad finally sent it off to the crusher.  I always dreamed of ""restoring"" it but there was NOTHING worth saving (failing engine  failing clutch  rust through all the way around  even the dashboard had split in half and was falling off).  The car gave 110%.  But it still makes me sad like euthanizing an old pet.  Nowadays?  When the car can no longer reliably make a 700-mile road trip on a moment's notice.  Then it's time to sell.  Each successive car will feel slightly less sentimental.  Which makes the decision a little bit easier."

159,">Not know the rules is not such a problem for players as the GM is encouraged to give the players an experience they enjoy rather than break it up with rulebook checking. We have tried to place War Within RPG in this environment....  This is a pretty rough paragraph. Just as a quick proof of concept  you could try something like:  ""War Within upholds this framework by de-emphasizing rules  liberating a GMs creativity from narrative-stifling rule checking.""  Obviously YMMV  I just threw something together real quick. But I think your campaign could do a lot with having your pitch be slightly more thematic and focusing more on what your game does well  rather than what other games do.

163,">So I'm curious; for those that moved away from D&D  what inspired that move?  In my case: not completely understanding D&D.  There's a certain level of Zen involved in fully grokking Gary's Grand Auld Game (especially the original editions  white box OD&D and 1e OAD&D). Without it  there are any number of reasons why D&D won't work for you.  I tried the crunchy alternatives. I tried the rules-lite options. I tried some of that ""narrativist"" business. But it very quickly became apparent that other systems didn't have anything better to offer. So I went back home  to the first editions of D&D  still without fully grasping what makes the great-granddaddy of all game-systems truly *sing*.  It took many more years of running 1e for me to really *get* it."

166,">to earn money you must treat it as a real job with long hours (fortunately i figured this out early)  Yup. Anecdotally  kids assume that because playing games is fun  making them must be fun  too. The reality is very different. I'm always reminded of the Futurama quote after Fry writes a screenplay that lasts a few minutes: ""It took me an hour to write  I assumed it would take an hour to read.""  &#x200B;  >everything has been done already  I agree with the sentiment  but disagree with the phrasing: everything that you are currently capable of doing has probably been done already. Life is a learning process  regardless of your job (I've worked professionally in games and outside of games - in any job  you either constantly learn or you get left behind).  The good news is  games are an artistic medium. So just because someone has already created a painting  doesn't mean you cannot create your own painting that expresses something different.  &#x200B;  >doing art is hard  easier to buy assets  hate the ""jack of all trades"" aspect to gamedev  I'm grouping these together because it sounds like you could benefit from being on a team. There is a spectrum of specialist (""Environment artist"" or ""network engineer"") to generalist (""art lead"" or ""technical director"")  and trying to do everything perfectly just is not possible. Finding your core competency  and then finding others with complementary competencies might be what you need to be successful (some people hate working with other people  and that path is much harder).  &#x200B;  >99% of projects end up abandoned  That is because when starting a project  most people are doing something new for the first time. Its a learning exercise  so while the initial steps of doing something new can be invigorating  when they reach middle of the learning curve  they give up because they are so far outside their comfort zone. Going into a project  be VERY clear about what you're doing and what you do not know (the ""known unknowns"").  The SECOND time or THIRD time you try to build that project you gave up on previously  you'll get much much much further. At some point  you might even finish the game you had envisioned (note: it will NOT look like how you originally conceived it)  and if you're very lucky  it might actually be fun.  So yeah: understanding the goal (learning or shipping  or making money)  and knowing what you do not know (ie  multiple repeated attempts on the same concept) will ease the sting of this.  &#x200B;  >it calms me down  This is probably the most surprising thing to me on your list. All I can say is: good. Even if you don't end up with a career in game dev  it sounds like it could be a hobby for you (and there is nothing wrong with that).  &#x200B;  >i love to polish existing projects  I take back my last statement: THIS is the most surprising thing to me on your list.

167,>To me  in a silicon shortage  192MB of L3 even for a 5900X seems pie in the sky  let alone for the entire range...  There ain't confirmation of lower end vcache sku  most likely estimation's that it'd launch for just 12 or 16 cores sku priced at a premium. There might not even be a 6 or 8 core sku. Don't think it's a popular idea that there'd be an full product stack refresh  A single chiplet sku probably performs the same as a dual chiplet sku anyway. The stacked cache ain't unified across different chiplets so i ain't seein how having 2 chiplets (192 vs 96) would help in games.

174,"1) ""Input"" is a class that Unity provides to you. It's for reading input.  2) getAxis takes a string because it needs to know which axis you are retrieving the value for. These names are set up in the input manager. For example  ""Horizontal"" could be the X axis of a joystick.  See: https://docs.unity3d.com/ScriptReference/Input.GetAxis.html  The type of data you put into a function doesn't have to match the type of data coming out. In this case  you provide a string to the function so the function can look up the input that matches that name. The value of the input is returned (which is not a string).  As another example  consider a function that returns the age of a person:  public int GetAge(string personName){ ... }  If you asked someone to tell you the age of another person  would you give them a number because you were expecting a number back? No  you would give them the name of the person you are asking about. The other person would look for that name in his record book of birthdays  hopefully find the person you are asking about  and then tell you his age in years after doing some date math.  I think it's possible that you may be confused by functions in math  which take numbers as input and produce numbers as output. In programming  inputs and outputs can be *anything*."

183,"100% **Grim Dawn**.  Great classes  each with their own skill tree.  Huge passive tree (Constellations) with some passives giving procs you can tie to skills.  Lots of secrets: the minimap doesn't tell you everything  and you'll often find secret loot in out of the way places.  Itemization is awesome in Grim Dawn.  They have items that will occasionally drop from specific mobs that have unique benefits to them (eg +3 to a certain skill  lower cooldowns for skill  etc).  You're encouraged to find out of the way places in Grim Dawn because there are often shrines there  and by cleansing shrines you get points to spend on Constellations  which can factor heavily into your build.  I think the best way to play Grim Dawn is on hardcore veteran.  When you play hardcore  you live on the razor's edge.  The game is more vibrant knowing that if you mess up  your character is gone forever.  The downside to this is that very few of your characters will ""make it to the end"".  But taking a hardcore character into a dungeon with no escape possible (you either survive or die) ... you can't find that kind of thrill in softcore.  The other downside to playing hardcore is that since your characters rarely survive past level 50  you almost never see uniques  just set items.  But that makes the ones you do see all the more precious.  While you by no means need to get the 2 expansions for Grim Dawn  they're both solid.  The base game is super cheap on sale (like 7 bucks)  but the expansions rarely go on deep discount.    While the amount of awesome mod content out there is staggering  I encourage you to play unmodded for a long while.  The class combinations you can set up (especially with the expansions) are very diverse.  While the mods can bring a complete explosion of classes  they're not always well balanced."

193,2015-2016 were probably the bleakest years for AMD  I'd say. I was certain that AMD will be practically limited to console market in the coming years.  Intel and Nvidia had launched their Skylake and Pascal architectures respectively at around Q2 2016 whereas AMD was no where to be seen  at least not in the high-end game where the real money is.  Nvidia's GTX1070/1080 and Intel's i7-6700K literally had ZERO competition at their release as both Ryzen and Vega 56/64 were still an year away  an eternity in the tech world  and people were also extremely skeptical.

I had many other cars I should have bought for great deals from amazing owners that took care of them when they weren't overpriced (s2000  FD RX-7  964 911). It was overpriced at that time  but nothing like today. As for the money  at that time I could have afforded these cars if I wasn't so hesitant to pull the trigger. These are all in CAD  so you can imagine how cheap it was compared to today.   Lesson to be learned  buy the cars you like and enjoy  with the intention of keeping them. Even if you don't end up doing that in the long run  it's the mind set you should have. Time flies  these cars disappear off the market and whatever it's left will cost you more down the road.
196,20-30fps for high settings in Cyberpunk is actually really impressive to me. A close to locked 30fps experience at custom low-medium settings should be possible then  which means it's probably still a better experience than like a ps4 pro  although at a lower resolution.
197,"24 cores? I thought it had 8 Real cores  16 threads  and 8 ""Efficient Cores"" (which I still feel has no business in a Desktop CPU - useful for Laptop and Mobile CPUs I still don't fully grasp how this functions  and I wonder if the sheer overhead of swapping from 'Efficient to 'Real' cores is going to save time or end up slowing the system down)  tl;dr:  Shouldn't it read as 16 physical cores and 24 threads?"
198,260hp from a 3-cylinder is bonkers. The 600hp Koenigsegg 3-cylinder will blow it out of the water  but for now this sits atop the podium three cylinder performance.   Side note  its weird how polarized 3-cylinder powered cars are.  There are a bunch of compact cars (Fiesta  Yaris  Mini  Mirage  SmartCar) and then the i8 and soon the Gemera. Nothing in the middle. Basically econo boxes and high performance sports cars.
199,30 seconds in the trailer  I still have no idea what the game is about  how does it play  and if I suspect some kind of shenanigans or cgi maybe not even what it looks like. Most people would have turned away before that.  Try hooking people under 5 seconds. If you're good enough it could be a joke or a question or something. If not  at least show what the game is. Then loop back to delve deeper into it.  Edit: on top of that  you're releasing to one of the most fatigued audience: yet another early access survival building crafting game. Just hearing that  more than half the audience has moved away before even looking at a single frame or screenshot.  You have to also hook that audience. Show  *insanely quickly*  why your game is unique? What problem the other have yours solve? What are you doing that nobody else does  or that everybody else is doing wrong?  Why would I risk a lot by paying for early access for this game  when I could play Subnautica  or Valheim  or 7 Days to die  or Space Engineers  or The Forest  or DayZ  or Scrap Mechanic?  I'm not saying those games are perfect. Each of them has *major* flaws. But you're not arguing in court  you're trying to sell something to an audience who on average has a backlog of games the size of your dev changelog  no attention and no time for you.  What are you doing that's unique or better?  Having watched your trailer on Steam:  * It's not the audio  it's passable  at best (and I'm generous) * It's not the feel of the presentation  I mean you have this twist of playing a robot but it moves with the steps of a teenager and no effect on the soil or atmo and the noise of a small children. They're no weight  no slight sinking into the soil  no inertia when it changes direction  I didn't even hear a hint of noise from articulations.And that's just presentation. I don't know why playing a robot is different  or better  than playing a human in the other games?I mean if you're selling the fantasy of being a robot crashing unto a junk planet and doing stuff  then sell this fantasy. * It's not the graphics. They're passable  possibly  but there's no strong art direction  it's brown bland brown scifi that's brown. I mean  [this makes me dream more of being a robot on an distant planet](https://4kwallpaper.wiki/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/85837.jpg)  or [that is someplace I would like to build](https://wallpaperaccess.com/full/2119181.jpg). What's your hook? Where's the dream? * It's not the simulation  that fire seems to be burning metal  on a loop  without spreading or extinguishing or being affected by wind  and with no visible electrical damage. * It's not the immediate profound immersion. I mean  I'm supposed to be a robot and have access to high tech I suppose  and I'm building a room with stairs and walls. Why am I building a room  at all? Do I need a roof? Shelter? How are those thin rusty looking walls a better protection than my own robotic shell?  I'll stop there.  I'm not trying to be an asshole  b
200,35 year old Benzs never use first either. You have to either select it from the shifter  or romp on the throttle all the way past the downshift click on the accelerator to get them to not start in 2nd.
201,48 here  found my colleague was role player  and wasn't the only one. Went to his game in roll20 and did that stuff for year or so  now  after few games  have my old friends plus one neighbour playing zweihnder with me plus 5 in our buildings space. Go figure. No bloody role aster nor space opera for me anymore though 
202,"5 days sitting in one spot  not moving  not eating  not relieving himself  and he is physically fine? I guess the gods must be taking care of the body's needs during that time.  ""Memorize 3 large books by tomorrow."" Wonder which god helps make THAT possible. Maybe whoever the God of Knowledge is blessed him with photographic memory.  Blood's little ""throw the chick into a monster's nest to make it fly out"" may seem extreme  but still easier than the Gus' memorization assignments.  Dumb MC lets the spear undead know he's there and fights it fairly instead of just attacking it from behind. ""What Would Blood Do?"" You're not Blood  kid.  Apparently you don't need to actually say the spells out loud for them to take affect - just mouthing the Words is enough. But MC doesn't like sneak attacks so I bet he'll never do it even if his and others' lives depend on it.  Has Blood trained MC to fight with spears?  Gus being sus as fuck throughout. Wonder if he just wanted MC to kill him in the tunnels  or if he wanted to kill MC in a way that wouldn't finger himself. Then that request for MC to throw the fight against Blood - I highly doubt there's an actually good reason to refuse to tell MC why. Or maybe the three of them swore an OATH to the God of Isekais to keep MC in the dark about literally everything that matters."
203,5e PCs stop being pulp fantasy heroes at around 7th or 8th level  and moves into epic fantasy territory. I don't have a problem with epic fantasy  I just have a hard time running it and writing challenges for those higher levels  and I prefer Conan to FF. I also suck at running high level monsters unless I cheat  and I don't like to cheat. All the DM stuff I don't like to do just gets harder the longer the campaign goes.  D&D also comes with a host of player expectations about what their character options are  which lead to world building requirements if I'm going to run a sandbox campaign (which I am going to do... every time). If I want to run a world without anthropomorphic animals and PC monster races  I'm going to have to get ahead of players and let them know that  because the default assumption seems to be that everything in D&D beyond is fair game... And chances are the players will be disappointed that their favorite builds won't be available. (That said  I had a great time running a campaign in a gonzo-fantasy version Waterdeep one time).  All that said  I think I'm done with 5e for awhile... Although I think I could be convinced to run a Planescape campaign someday. 5e might be strangely well suited to such a bonkers setting.
204,6 YEAR HERE  I have multiple projects I started but not released a single game. Just a few Marketplace Packs. I come from IT and yes GAME DEV is way harder.  But I absolutely REFUSE to quit.. Hang In there!
205,86 (Eighty-six)!! part 2 is currently airing and gives me similar vibes. And its really freaking good too  It has gore and a good story. It has good action but its not the main focus and its not frequent. It focuses more on humanity and building characters but will get you grasped really quick  Would recommend Re:Zero too which is also really freaking good buuut the first arcs (first 12 episodes) can get repetitive and boring but after that it gets better and better and its story and world building is spectacular during season 2.  In total 50 episodes have already (2 seasons of 25 episodes. S2 has two parts) so this is my second recommendation. It features a lot of gore  a lot. And with gore theres action too.
206,9 years ago I bought my 2008 Audi RS4 in Glut Orange.  I bought it sight unseen across the country.  At the time  nobody wanted an orange car. It was on the lot forever  so I lowballed them and they accepted.  Fast forward to today  and it's one of the most desirable colors and RS4 prices are going up.  Bad news is  somebody rear ended me a few weeks ago  totaled the car and insurance is giving me basically nothing.
207,95% of 'influencers' just want to play the LATEST games or the 'viral games' like Among Us or whatever  so 95% of them will see that the game isn't popular yet or whatever and just avoid it or ignore your requests. And A LOT of them will charge you just for the 'privlage' of featuring your game on their channel. You can however  use a website like www.keymailer.co to get in touch with tonnes and tonnes of influencers  who DON'T charge  Anyway man  send me a Steam key and I'll be sure to cover it on my channel. I don't charge indie devs  only the big corps. I'm not huge but can give your game a few new eyeballs for sure ( [www.youtube.com/lfpgaming/videos](https://www.youtube.com/c/LFPGaming/videos?view=0&sort=p&flow=grid) ). Send a key to lfpgaming.yt@ gmail.com if you like (or just use the keymailer site  either way is fine). Best of luck
208,A 2020 mac should have a Thunderbolt 4 port  making all the difference in the world.  Not too familiar with mac  but if you can save up and upgrade the ram later if needed  get the newer model.  Also  it's likely the M1 chip runs slower  but is far more powerful.
209,A battle scene.  In the middle of a massive Star Wars space battle  the players' ship crashed into the bottom of a Star Destroyer  and was stuck sticking out of it.    There was a session-long run-and-gun battle across the underside of a Star Destroyer  against Special Forces Storm Troopers deployed to stop them  while a massive space battle took place above their heads and the Star Destroyer they were on was actively in combat.  It was completely improv'd when they massively failed a piloting roll with a badly damaged ship  and yet it was the most talked about thing from this whole campaign.  The visual just makes me happy to think about.
210,"A better definition is what Jon Peterson noted in his history of tabletop gaming in ""Playing at the World."" An RPG specifically when you look at its roots (and what proper RPGs since then have been oriented around the idea of) is a game where you play as some form of character with quantitative values (stats) that help the player understand and roleplay the qualitative values (characteristics) of the characters. It's about a conversion from qualitative to quantitative so that you can play a character. Nothing more and nothing less.  There are things that get treated as essential characteristics to RPGs like player choice and character creation but that's not true at all. Player choice arguably controls whether it's a good experience or not. The game or DM can railroad you and it's still an RPG  just a bad one. And making your own character isn't true either because plenty of RPGs have premade characters whether it's vidya or tabletop again.  Then you get those who think that an RPG is about numbers mostly  especially some of the old CRPG buffs. There's an attitude that a game must be crunchy and have lots and lots of statistics to be good  but some of the best RPG experiences people have had gave minimal contact with numbers with the dice rolled by the AI or the DM in the background.  As mentioned before  genres can have some blur but we can still be accurate with the definition. This is the only definition that encompasses nearly every kind of RPG while still being true to the original RPGs that spawned them.  edit: I talked with some buddies  and as an addendum  I think Peterson's definition should be improved slightly. The character you play (for a more ""traditional RPG"" definition) should be what interacts with the world rather than you directly. So generally you'll need opportunities to express things as the character rather than default to what you directly think."
211,A bit of advice  from my own experience:  * Run campaigns with a set length instead of multi-year  never ending ones. If you explain in the beginning that the campaign will run for  for example  15-20 sessions  it's much easier to motivate yourself to run it to completion. * Run a campaign with sessions every 2 or 3 weeks and put one-shots in between  preferably using games very different from what you use for the campaign. It's also your testing grounds for games to choose for the next campaign after the current one ends. * While you run a campaign  also play in another GM's games. The change of perspective between running and playing a game gives you the variety you need  especially if the games are significantly different.
212,A block of Ordered Chaos.  I could shape into any type of melee weapon.  however if you were not a chaos mage  it would woogie you the fuck out. and Order mages would look at and see the ultimate abomination of magic items.
213,A comment from the article seems to sum up my thoughts:  > Tesla only started selling the Model S in mid-June and hasnt produced any Xs this year. This is a weird comparison. The Taycan outselling the 911 is a more interesting statistic to me.
214,A copy-paste from another part of the thread  for visibility:  Some older unions - particularly in the USA - aren't very good  because the whole movement/concept has been damaged by anti-union action by the government (e.g. the FBI)  and corporations.     I know that probably sounds like tinfoil hat stuff  but here's some info:     [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History\_of\_union\_busting\_in\_the\_United\_States](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_union_busting_in_the_United_States)     [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Union\_busting#Use\_of\_public\_funds\_in\_the\_United\_States](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Union_busting#Use_of_public_funds_in_the_United_States)     The result of that activity is that SOME older unions in the USA have connections to organized crime and are combative  insular  and protect only their members  not the workers as a whole. Sometimes this is related to long-term attacks on the union - they are permitted to exist only because not many workers belong and there is strong pressure against recruitment. These unions are often ineffectual  even counter-productive for working class people.     So  there are problems with some older unions. Different people argue about how many older unions. Some talk about anti-union propaganda and say the problems are very rare. But regardless  modern  new unions don't seem to have any of these problems.     So whatever problems one poster's father had with union members in his work are probably to do with one of these older  corrupted  defanged  broken  mafia-connected unions that were all that was permitted to survive through things like The Red Scare.     Pathfinder's union would be a new  shiny  as-yet-unfucked union  and probably a Very Good Thing.
215,"A couple of terms that might help are: ""sleeper"": a car that looks ordinary  but is actually really fast (either through being modified  or maybe factory options) ""Restomod"" a car that's been restored using better parts than original  often engines  suspension  and drivetrain from a modern car.  HTH"
216,A couple people have recommended Agon  a game of adventure in the time of Ancient Greece and it's myths. But they also mention that the system could be adapted for use with other mythologies and historical eras i.e. the Norse and their mythology.
217,A CVT is supposed to be smooth  since it can continuously change its gear ratio  but if it creates fake shifts... what the point?  Edit: I know they do it so it still feels like an automatic. Basically what I'm trying to say is  if it acts the same as an automatic  what's the point of it?
218,A few years ago I picked up one of my all time favorite cars as a second car/garage queen. I plan on doing some work on it with my kiddos  and hopefully passing it down someday. My problem now is the car keeps going up in value! All the mods I have planned are reversible  and I'll keep all the stock parts  but man it's tempting to just sit on it and sell someday. I think the experience of working on it with my kids is worth more to me though. And those canyon drives with the sunroof open are priceless.   What are your opinions/experiences?
219,"A friend of mine just got some new tires on her BMW 3 series.  After they put them on  she noticed significant shaking whenever she applied the gas.  Her mechanic told her the tires are ""too good"" and it's causing the car to struggle to put the power down as the tires are ""too grippy.""  Has anyone experienced this with a vehicle before?  This sounds pretty fishy to me.  And the tires she put on the car are Michelin CrossClimate 2's."
220,"A friend of mine was ridiculing electric vehicles and Tesla ten years ago when I told him this is the future  and that Tesla will be bigger than any automotive company in the world.   He is still ridiculing Tesla  and sends me articles like these  where ""aha! One Porsche model was sold more than one from Tesla!"".   I find it amazing how he keeps moving the goal  but in his mind he is still in the same argument with me. In only 10 years  we got to the point where it's fair comparison between a startup company and freaking Porsche  with Porsche even being seen as an underdog. And 10 years ago  ""Porsche selling more EVs than 911s in 2021"" was nothing but a bad joke."
221,A fun alternative to Hearthstone is Skyweaver  a beta project that uses a lot of similar mechanics  but with the addition of trading and utilization of NFT  I have been enjoying their beta and they have made every single decision correctly so far on a management level  all you hearthstone addicts should all give it a try as the community transitions away from Blizzards products.  EDIT: Beta keys can be found by messaging a staff member on their official discord!
222,A good start would be to swap out the PSU if you had any extras. If it cant get enough power  itll shut off. Then you may want to move onto cooling  it may turn off if at temperatures too high to operate.  *The end all option would be to get a motherboard speaker to get a diagnosis directly from the board*
223,A Link to the Past is 30 years and absolutely does not need a remake. It's aged like a fine wine. Great length  interesting map  fun items and mechanics  secret areas  excellent sprite art  iconic music and a solid story.
224,"A little bit of background. I am currently developing a game that is set on an airport and as I add elements to the story I started to think about adding a bit about the whole pandemic and the effects it had on airports. To be clear  the game is not about the pandemic  but I feel like it is a topic that I would like to explore if it is not too sensitive.  Also  I should mention that the game is for VR  so I am kinda worried that if I add even a little bit of it  because of the immersive nature of VR  it might ""wake up"" strong emotions for some people and that is definitely not something I would like to do.  What are your thoughts on this?"
225,A little off topic  but maybe someone knows what could be the reason?  I usually turn off my Lenovo IdeaPad 730s laptop  but when I turn it on after a couple of weeks I find that the battery is low.  How can the battery run out when the device is turned off?
226,A lot of good advice here but I would recommend something else - I am a person who gets into things deeply as well and can relate to your situation to a degree. I have always taken care to balance my activities and by doing that not focusing on one thing too hard.   So here it comes: Do some sports  go running or to the gym  something to clear your head that has nothing to do with any media. Or play boring games like Sudoku that engage your brain but not your creativity.
227,A lot of good info here from a lot of people  but maybe you might want to consider talking to someone for PR. Having someone whose entire job is dealing with taking your info and sharing it with a community  keeping you separate from them can be an incredible asset.
228,A lot of ideas here but nothing very definite . If the issue is purely low tire pressure the car will pull one direction under braking. If your alignment is off your tires should wear funny. If your tie rod ends are bad youll feel play in the front end if you swerve left then right. If your shocks are bad when you hit a bump youll bounce like a spring for a ways. Probably just an alignment issue
229,A lot of old JRPGs are this way.  Someone mentioned Dragon Quest XI  but their description of hard mode just sounds like normal mode for the older ones.  Many of the Final Fantasy games have optional super areas and super bosses that bring the difficulty right back up to 11   but even those are more forgiving than DQ.    If you're down for ARPGs  check out the Dark Souls series.  Stats and grinding make things marginally easier  but they remain brutally difficult up through the final boss.
230,A lot of turn-based strategy games (Final Fantasy Tactics  Tactics Ogre  Horizon's Gate  etc). I do the same thing as you  watching stand up specials and listening to podcasts and whatever  and because those games are turned based  you can zone out for a minute without missing anything. If you're in an engagement for farming purposes or just clearing trash and there's little risk of losing if you mess up  it's easy to just kinda auto-pilot battles.      I also find hack-and-slash type games to work well for this  since you're just running around spamming abilities and murdering hordes fairly mindlessly. Diablo 2 is the classic choice  but you've also got Titan's Quest  D1  D3  Torchlight series  Dungeon Siege series  and tons more.    MMO's are good for this too  but in my opinion it really only works when you're going through content you've seen before (unless you don't care about the stories or whatever).
231,A menu screen and a single level/infinite level is about as simple as you can get. At the end of the day  its more about how well you know yourself in terms of project scope.   I got kinda lucky because I underestimated how long my game would take to make  but also the amount of time I had to make my game got extended significantly  so Ill be able to finish. Theres so much outside of making the game (like marketing  setting up developer accounts  making content) that it would be kinda nice to start smaller and still push through those steps for when you have a larger project.
232,"A paid game can have a free ""demo"". It's up to you whether they're different. Though I suggest you make it very clear to customers.  Are you sure you don't want to give paying supporters even just a cosmetic thanks? Like just ""Supporter's Build"" on the title screen?"
233,A pleasant surprise.   &#x200B;  I just hope the Integra isn't just a rebodied SI/Type R  and that Acura managed to get the manual to work with SH-AWD.   &#x200B;  As an aside  has there ever been a SH-AWD manual car? Like  IIRC  the TL didn't have manual the generation with SH-AWD  the RLX  TLX  and MDX never had manual to begin with. Did i miss a model? Did ZDX get SH-AWD?
234,A ram slot on my motherboard went out   so I went from 32 to 24gb but now I'm angry.  Asus says it's out of warranty.  I could just use Amazon to buy a new motherboard but I'm curious if anyone has had better luck purchasing from other places
235,A rapid expansion of semi industry in India would be excellent news for better future stability within the region. Besides the US  realistically India is the next best counterweight against China.  &#x200B;  India is probably the most peaceful superpower in the region.
236,A smarter cruise control focused on fuel efficiency and not just controlling speed.   I know some vehicles are using route-based speed adaptations (which slows down near upcoming bends) to increase comfort. But I'm talking about having a vehicle adjust the throttle to reduce fuel consumption. Namely where there are grade changes.   So less throttle uphill (within an allowable speed decrease  say 5-10 km/hr) or a slight increase in throttle downhill when there is an uphill section coming ahead (so a speed increase downhill of 5-10 km/hr).   This would allow for greater fuel economy. I do this in some portions of city driving to save fuel. I don't do it on the highway (because it's easier to just let the cruise work) but a background system could run it automatically to save you extra bits of fuel.   With the LIDAR technology that exists  I don't see why a road topography couldn't be uploaded to a cloud system. Then your vehicle location is sent to the cloud to determine the topography it's driving on (most highway driving you won't be changing roads very often). Then the system can know the topography ahead and determine an optimal throttle strategy to save fuel.
237,"A straight pipe will be much cheaper because it is literally just what it says  it's a pipe. It will need to be done correctly though  a lot of newer cars have sensors before and after the cat. If it's not done properly  it might put the car in ""limp mode"" until it gets fixed. As others have said  as long as the mufflers are there  it will be about the same loudness as it would be with a cat. The cat does make it a bit quieter but it's the mufflers that do most of the work."
238,"A thing i noticed just now: Shin's Reiginleif ""decapitate"" a Lowe with the high frequency blades . Visually is almost like a revenge against the same type of machine that did try to do that on him on ep 11."
239,A thing that I've started doing to get that itch out is switching systems within a given campaign! So like  for my Urban Shadows game about Greasers fighting the U.S government we used Mobile Frame Zero: Firebrands for our finale special  In a sci-fi game I did we were going to play Kingdom as a midseason finale before plans fell through. This let's you get in those new systems without having to throw out your current campaign!
240,A thread for game developers to post their latest game updates and hopefully get some great feedback from users.  If you are a developer  please make sure to include a top-level comment description of no less than 100 characters and engage with the community!

242,A toggle switch that allows all the windows to be rolled down at the same rate.  So that way  when you want the windows rolled down only half way  they can all be at the same level and not look uneven.  Many times have I had to manually try to match all 4 windows. I probably looked like an idiot.
243,A very easy RPG tuned to young kids is Amazing Tales.  As written the tone is very much G-rated  and easy to pick up.  Players describe a few things they are good at  and prioritize them.  Their best skill rolls a d20  next best rolls a d12  etc.  Success is rolling over 2 (or 3?).  Easy to grasp and the kids get to play with nifty dice. The books on DriveThru have a lot of adventure starters  which you could swap elements to be more spooky.  Another idea would be to take inspiration from a Scooby Doo episode.
244,A weird dude in Kabuki makeup and a kimono asked me if I wanted to fill out out a game of The Mountain Witch at a con and my mind was blown  then expanded.  I still Dnd but there are so many other experiences out there...
245,"A. Fiasco is a fantastic GMless game that has a card based (which is also diceless) box version.  B. There are very simple  minimal math required rpgs that aren't diceless. Lady blackbird is one of my go-to ""intro to rpg"" game. It requires zero prep  very easily creates drama  and require basic counting level math."
246,Absolutely. Local game stores are all 20 somethings who only play dnd 5e and cash-hammer $40k. None of them have any interest playing anything new or different.  Edit: i am sure geography plays a big roll here and larger urban areas will have larger more diverse populations of players. For those of us in smaller areas finding a group can be nearly impossible.
247,AC Odyssey is probably the closest thing to a Witcher clone on the market.  If you consider Witcher 3 an RPG  you'll most likely consider this game one too.  I wouldn't consider it as good overall  except for when it comes to the gameplay.  Combat is a bit more polished and the stealth adds a bit more variety that the Witcher can be lacking.  I really liked it  but it seems to be fairly controversial overall.  I'd say it's worth a try now that you can usually find it on sale for like $15.
248,ACDelco no longer makes anything  they buy other companies parts and repackage them. Spark plugs are made by NGK  rotating electrical is Denso  bearings are SKF. If you buy premium aftermarket pats you are basically buying OE nowadays.
249,Actual bunnies  or girls dressed in bunny girl outfits?  Or a bit of both?  I mean Haruhi Suzumiya has Haruhi & Mikaru dress in the bunny girl costume. Bulma from Dragon Ball wears it at least once (and Launch as well).  Actual bunnies include Mesousa (Pani Poni Dash)  Haru (Beastars)  and even Ryo-Ohki (a cat/rabbit creature from Tenchi Muyo).
250,Advanced Dungeons & Dragons Pool of Radiance on NES. It's been a long time since I played it  so I don't know if it still holds up  but I had a lot of fun with it when I was younger. But then I also liked Warriors of the Eternal Sun.
251,Adventures of Alundra.  It's deliberately a clone of A Link To The Past made for PS1 players  so it doesn't need to be updated with 3d visuals. And the graphics are incredibly atmospheric. I would love a true sequel/prequel/spin-off set in the same world  and I won't mind if they have fancy new graphics and cut scenes in any new entries  though I'd happily keep the old graphic style. But leave this baby alone.
252,Advice on keeping the game fresh?  For me  one thing worked. I have given up on official campaigns  and started player driven sandboxes. The ideas  plots  surprises contributed by the players keep it fresh \_for me as a GM\_. It is also easier to start up than a longish official campaign (less to read).  &#x200B;  Changing systems: not really. I have a few favorites which I know quite well. I also force myself to not buy any products which will never see actual play.
253,Aesthetically speaking  coupes look much better than sedans  to me. And looks are not a minor thing. Your car  like your clothes  is a visual expression of who you are. That's why people get personalized license plates  bumper stickers  and cosmetic mods  and why cars don't all come in only one color.  As for why FWD? Honestly  I don't see what the drivetrain has to do with any of this. Maybe you want RWD so you can drift or maybe you want FWD because it's easier to drive in the snow  and AWD is more expensive.  Also  I'm one dude; I don't need four doors.
254,After a couple of tests I've been finally able to do (working 12 hour shifts sucks!) I think I can conclude that my new video card is going bad already.  It started with one of my displays wigging out during a VM (screen flickering  apparent burn in symptoms from VM) to another display that won't work any higher than a resolution that 640x 480.  The test that confirmed this  I connected a DVD player to the Monitor (TV) I couldn't get to go over 640x480 and the movie played fine on it at full resolution.   My only other option is the cable being bad but would that affect another monitor (The monitor that was flickering and suffered from temporary burn in (It's fine now BTW) was a different monitor than the one that is now stuck at 640x480)? I'm pretty sure the card is on the fritz.
255,After finishing (and absolutely loving) Divinity: Original Sin 2 a few months ago  I now have another itch for a top-down DnD-inspired CRPG.  The games that caught my eye are the newest Pathfinder game  Pathfinder: Wrath of the Righteous  and Solasta: Crown of the Magister. (There's also Baldur's Gate 3  but Im waiting for it to come out of Early Access before I jump in).  For those that have played them  which one do you think is better and why?
256,After several years with my surface pro 4 and now a Mac air (not even m1) I really can't see myself getting another surface pro  until Ms does some serious work on performance and battery... The pro 4 (i5 in my case) never felt smooth to use for anything but the most simple tasks.   I know it's a tablet form factor  but it just seems like an iPad pro would be a much smoother experience...  Which sucks  as I enjoy windows on a tablet...
257,After yesterdays suspicious Ashes benchmark that [literally had an update to support the unusual configuration of 16 cores/24 thread (suggesting it was really to give Intel the advantage)](https://pbs.twimg.com/media/E_yGho2VcBAsv0z.png)  this is good news suggesting that Intel are actually getting their act together!  Exciting times!  I'm keen to see how well AMD's Zen3 Refresh/3D Cache will counter this :D
258,A-fucking-men. I too had a spiritual moment when reading that passage. So far using this game and its tools has provided the most satisfying campaign of adventure roleplaying in the traditional vein that I've ever run--and the PCs are only 3rd level.
259,Ah okay  the fallout wasnt what I expected from the Wife thing. If anything Takeda is the one totally inscrutable character. Either hes really good at playing it off or hes dense as hell at this stage.  Poor Futaba. Somehow the non-reaction is worse.   Of course  Futaba is still in the initial stages of figuring out what shes feeling. Her focus is on her body image issues and trying to be seen as desirable. Turns out shes always been compact and flat. Hard to blame her for having a complex when you work with Sakurai and your best friend is Natsume (love both of them so far). That earth sun shot was pure visual comedy. Im feeling bad for her honestly.   I do like where they end her story for the episode though. It doesnt resolve her feelings of inadequacy  but it does bring her just one step closer to recognizing her feelings for Takeda. We know hes a bro who cares about her  but saving her from an upskirt pervert with Judo moves is a pretty heroic moment. He does at least call her a woman at the end even if he threw in little. Got a long way to go on that one.   The real MVP and best boy is Kazama. Hes a stealth bro to all. Keeps the office guys from saying something that would hurt Futabas feelings. Gets the office creep away from Sakurai with a fake phone call. He also seems to be the most observant person in the office. Guess thats why hes the one filming in the OP.  His goodness is rewarded with being in the ship that is chugging along. Sakurai recognizes his good heart and asks him out to dinner! Its nice to see one of these romances take off at light speed. Dare we get an openly dating by season end? Love these too regardless and theyll tide me over till Fukeda actually takes off.    Notes  - Grandpa is exactly what I was hoping he would be. Hes going to be so much fun.   - I love that it seems like the people who know them can see exactly whats going on with Futaba and Takeda even if they dont. Thats usually how it works. Even the chief sees it.   - The train scene was a bit brutal. Im hoping its more that hes so tall he cant actually notice that shes got Bear Oppai than hes literally cannot see her as a woman so he just doesnt notice. Or maybe hes so honorable he notices and says nothing.   - The ED is very nice. Still overshadowed by how super infectious the OP is.  Its a fight between this and Banished for whos OP is the biggest earworm?
260,Ah shit. I've always loved the Z and have been seriously eyeballing the new one  but if the Integra is coming with a manual and I can avoid the clusterfuck that is today's Nissan... that's really fucking tempting.
261,Ahh Broadwell. The forgoten child.  Its actually impressive how well it still holds up in a fair 4C to 4C comparison. Ofc once you start adding more cores on the newer parts they blow it out of the watter but still.  Its a part that can easily still serve you well these days.
262,Alfa Romeo Brera  As soon as I started tying that I realised how cliche it sounds...  I still think (for me) it's the most beautiful car on the road.  2.2 4 banger is underpowered  2.4 diesel is cringe  3.2 is still slow  gets 18mpg and doesn't even sound like a busso.  All engine will try to detonate themselves by stretching their timing chains or eating themselves.  One day when I can afford a car collection I will have one for sure.
263,All [D100 systems](https://elruneblog.blogspot.com/2018/08/the-big-list-of-published-settings-for.html) are already more realistic than systems with level  etc. I prefer [HrnMaster](http://columbiagames.com/harnworld/)  which is quite fast  has an injury system and no hp  a complex hit locations  and a good armour system  skirmish system etc. There is also GunMaster from Bill Gant for modern weapons. HM is kind of rule light (combat is around 25 pages)  but it is complex and crunchy in the basic mechanics.  Another D100 system is RuneQuest/CoC etc. A ton of data for all possible ages  quite realistic  hit locations  hit points  Especially CoC rules are easy to learn and rule light.  [GURPS](http://www.sjgames.com/gurps mm a/) has a complex character generation  was draft to be a universal system  great sourcebooks but in my eyes overly complex with a ton of additional rules. By far not the game flow that a D100 system has. [GURPS light](https://www.drivethrurpg.com/product/236828/GURPS-Lite-Fourth-Edition) is most likely here the better system  and used by the Hellboy RPG  Discworld  etc.  [EABA](https://www.btrc.net/eabav2-119/eabav2core) has excellent combat & weapon sources. But I am afraid not rule light.  Phoenix Command is by far too complex to be playable or any good  but the sourcebooks have many details and can be interesting for a homebrew rules.  [Millenniums End](https://www.drivethrurpg.com/product/63044/Millenniums-End-v20) has some interesting ideas like the hit location spread on a plastic sheet and different target silhouettes. And the background goes deep in special forces and police work. I would recommend it as a rule light or fast system  but a possible inspiration.  I didn't checked out the new [Ironsworn: Starforged](https://www.ironswornrpg.com/product-ironsworn-starforged) out  but it could be a good and interesting alternative.
264,All ac games are the same.  I skip all cinematics and story lines.  Its all garbage and uninteresting.  You nailed it with the loot and leveling system and that gets repetitive.  The new Valhalla has a very fun oglog dice game that I play now.  I dont do anything but run around looking for towns so I can play against new opponents  other than that the game is no good.  I dont get the attraction to it.  Maybe its the Viking lore?
265,All else equal  and assuming the 12900k leaks are valid at all  I think the most interesting is the GB5 bench which leverages AVX512 (hence the RKL score) that is being handily beaten by the 12900k that does not have AVX512.  The P-Core arch and Intel 7 (10nm ESF) are kind of exciting. Meanwhile  the E-cores look like they exist when we need some juice but care more about power and thermals.  I'm starting to buy into this hybrid design. Seems to let them get away with making some fat ass cores for the **very many** consumer tasks that really are single or lightly threaded  while still offering scaling potential and letting the P-cores do the important stuff while the E-cores deal with the background noise.  Of course  this whole damn thing is conjecture until we get real reviews. Power  cost  availability - they'll all matter and remain unknown.  Side note: the CB23 RKL to ADL MT score is just hilarious/incredible if it's even close to accurate.
266,All of them are in hell but only one of them *actually* did the thing and deserves to be there.  A classic whodunnit where the players themselves have to figure out who did the thing. Only every one of them had a good reason  but only one actually did whatever it was *and* has to get to the point of admitting it to themself* that it's actually worthy of going to hell for it (or everyone else _not to_)
267,All rolls in front of everyone. If they made a PC at home  all numbers are rerolled. All DM rolls are public as well in combat  so no pulling punches.  PCs made at home with rolls for ability scores and hp? Hard no.
268,All. The. Time. I used to be very bad this way. What I've found helps me  is to not start out with a cool exciting new campaign concept or new cool rules. I take a system my players and I are comfortable with  and just make a bare-bones setting  a very basic map  a handful of NPCs. Then I let the players introduce elements as we play - NPCs  locations  factions  events - and I try to riff off that  so they and I are creating the setting ourselves  as the campaign progresses. Keeps it fresh for me and for them.
269,Almost every game is like that.  The best parts are the mystery and unknown when youre starting out  the learning  and being weak.  Later levels are always worse.  Systems are predictable.  Settings are fully known.  A truly great game remains great even when you know every inch of it.  But still  many games do get worse the more familiar you get with them. And last levels always suck.
270,Alot of cars I've owned seem to turn into classics  91 crx si bought for $500   86.5 suzuki samurai all stock bought for $900   94 1.8l miata with lsd bought for $1300  75 toyota pickup 4x4 bought for $1k  89 4runner 4x4 bought for $1500  92 e30 convertible bought for $2500  These 6 alone would probably be worth as much as my house if I had kept them.
271,Alright  so here's the scenario -- I've been taking my players through the **Dawn of Defiance** modules of the Saga Edition Star Wars D20  albeit  with some changes. Won't get into all of those  but this is where we're at:  * For those familiar with Dawn of Defiance  we're in between episodes III and IV. That's not really relevant information. * One of the players' estranged girlfriend was kidnapped by the Empire at the end of the third episode and they've spent the past six months (off screen) searching for information on her whereabouts for a rescue. * They've recently uncovered the information about where she is being kept and will be going into full-on rescue (think Return of the Jedi). * All I know is that the long-term plan is to have her been brainwashed by the Empire and have her end up being a deep sleeper agent that betrays them at the culmination of Episode VII (taking the place of the normal betrayal).  I'm struggling to come up with an interesting rescue mission  however  and would love ideas. Nothing is set in stone (including the above). I try to be flexible with plot. But I want to make this mission exciting  intelligent and dangerous.
272,Alright  warp to re:zero to steal the ability to revive  warp to one piece and drown foxy and buggy  warp to arifureta and kill him just before he gets out of the labyrinth  warp to black clover to steal finral and gauch's powers  warp to my hero academia to steal shinsos power then I'd be covered for pretty well anything Goku could dish out and since he likes to talk it'd be relatively easy to make him off himself.
273,"Alright episode. Not a fan of ""girl with small tits gets jealous over girls with big tits"" trope  but it's not the worst thing in the world. Her friend Natsume seems pretty fun. Also  I like Kazama and Sakurai's energy  hope they'll get together"
274,"Alright guys  you probably might know what this car is.  The Infiniti G35  also known as the 11th Generation Nissan Skyline was launched in June 2001 based on the XVL Concept unveiled at the Tokyo Motor Show 2 years previously.  With its launch came a wide barrage of displeasure from the Japanese and later  JDM fans. Phases like ""Not A Real Skyline"" and ""Not The Skyline I Know Of Anymore"" were widely discussed among these groups of people.  Perhaps they were a bit true as the V35 broke free from the traditional Skyline characteristics such as having no straight six engine and a more pedestrian design. (compared with the R34. The Coupe was a looker however.)   However it was still a sporty luxury sedan/coupe with its range topping 350GT coupe being equipped with a 3.5 litre VQ V6 making up to 276hp of horsepower and with a 0-100 of 6.0 seconds.   A 4WD ""250GT FOUR"" model equipped with the Atesa E-TS  was added to the Japanese lineup a few months later.   In February 2002  a new ""350-GT 8"" model was launched. This model was fitted with 17-inch alloy wheels  high-performance sports brake pads and a high-rigidity brake rotor.  Feature wise  the Skyline was equipped with VDC and a DVD-based Sat Nav system. Nissan's Syncho Rev Control was also standard in higher end models.   In USA  it was launched under the Infiniti brand and was praised for its driving dynamics by journalists  who also described it as ""being on par with the Germans"".   However sales were not strong in Japan due to it not having the ""formula"" of the Skyline and most importantly  it being too large for the Japanese roads.   It was therefore replaced by the V36 generation in 2007.  http://imgur.com/gallery/s1GFLUF"
275,"Also  both paths should have a rewarding ending  just a different one. For example: the good path has the MC marry the princess and become king of the country while in the evil path the MC kills the royal family and becomes the evil king of the country. No path should have an ending that feels like the player choose the ""wrong"" route (""wrong"" from a gameplay perspective  not a morally one)."
276,"Also  I think an EV should let you customize ""fake engine noise"". Maybe you want your Tesla to sound like a Dodge Demon when you floor it? Or maybe a Ferrari? Or hell maybe a Jetson's floaty car noise? Just download a file to a thumb drive  plug it into that giant screen and upload it to the car's software. This seems like it'd be right up Musk's alley."
277,Also would like to know this as well.   I've done a lot of research into this and there aren't really any good options. Addictinggames supposedly is accepting games as well (last time I checked was a year ago  sent them an email and no reply) and Poki might be as well? The only one I've seen really recommended in the last 2 years was Softgames but I'm not sure what their licensing terms are  or if payment is guaranteed (or if they're even accepting games). A lot of game portals (from what I've read) skip out on payment for whatever reason  but again this is all old info and no one talks about it because the industry isn't there so not sure of the status of it now.  IMO I wouldn't want to spend any amount of time for maybe sorta might get paid  and the market is basically a nub of what it was even 5 years ago. Now that I remember though  I think Newgrounds  and Gamejolt also have a rev share ad thing as well.   Mozilla has a dusty reference for web game monetization if you want some ideas though  but IMO it's looking kinda sparse.
278,Although I don't get a melancholy after running or playing  I do get an elation and excitement that can stop me sleeping. It's almost like my brain is still running at high speed.  I have also DM'd twice a week for around a year and pretty much burned out and started disliking DMing.   It's good you're recognising thar it's not possible to play TTRPGs all the time. It can easily become an obsession. But it can be a lifelong hobby and there's nothing wrong with spending some of your spare time doing it however don't neglect other obligations such as work  family  friends and chores.  Wish I had better advice but I too spend a lot of time reading and posting about the hobby I love.
279,Although it felt weird at the beginning when I heard about it  I have given it some thought and it's not really related. Think about it:    His content focused more on the theory of game design and how games 'felt' from the player perspective -- so he was never going into technical details about game implementation  art  modelling etc.... but rather used all the theoretical research he had done throughout his years to explain his feelings about various game design decisions  mechanics  systems etc.     TLDR: So think of it as his subjective opinions based on his previous theoretical experience on game research - and no value or respect has to be lost :)
280,"Always loved them as a kid and would play with Hotwheels/play Burnout/Gran Turismo1 etc.   What really accelerated it after going through middle/most of high school was seeing Forza Motorsport 4 on display at a Walmart and feeling that brain receptor go ""Hey  you remember you like cars right? *Buy it*""  Annnnd then I sunk a few hundred of my graduation money and bought a big boy 1080p TV (Coming from a SDtv) and Forza and fell back in love. Granted I'm not good with vehicles  best I can do is a brake and rotor change  but I still love reading about them and dreaming of affording my obtainable dream cars"
281,Always remember the original deus ex could be approached from many ways and had a lot of replay ability considering its age not sure how human revolution and its successors have faired never played them .
282,Am I crazy or does it seem like parts of his videos lately are like in 1.5 speed? Sometimes hes talking so fast and arm movements are so fast I have to check my YouTube settings and make sure its not accidentally playing above normal speed.
283,Am I suppose to be excited? Latest Wolfenstein games were pretty lame and last one was terrible. Also best reboot was Quake 4 with that shocking transformation scene. Id like to experience that again  but with larger scale war on Stroggos. Quake 4 had that  but only in very beginning and then it was one man army.
284,Amazing review OP. Love seeing these reviews  especially from other countries. Especially from latin america (my username lol). In general  would you say there is a strong car culture in Panama? Are cars there typically older than in the west  or newer?
285,AMD itself has had a pretty decent track record in the past couple of years of delivering  which is why people are willing to give AMD the benefit of the doubt.   The 15% is likely an average across many workloads. Some will see worse improvements than 15 percent and some better.   The cache die will use specially optimized libraries to allow for a more densely packed configuration. Depending on the pricing  only the high end may get this at first  although if the cost falls in future generations  I suspect that this will trickle down.
286,And just like that Apples most appealing product this year isn't appealing anymore. I hate jelly scrolling (and OLED purple smearing)  and from the video it looks like the new iPad mini has a bad case of it.
287,And just like that Eighty-Six returns with the weekly dose of sadness. Even though Eugene was a walking death flag from the first episode he was introduced  it still hurt to see him go. Having him getting all messed up without showing how it happened really emphasizes how abruptly and unceremoniously one can die in war. I've always loved how Eighty-Six never dramatizes the death scenes but still manages to make them hit you in the feels. 10/10 episode.
288,And that's all without the need to learn about how to properly market your game and run a social media presence or hope that a publisher does not screw you over through confusing and one sided legal contracts.      Solo game dev. requires such a diverse skill set with so much risk involved  where you might end up using up all your savings and after years of work never recuperate it.     Honestly I cannot explain why there are so many solo game devs out there in such a competitive market  other than trying to make their child version proud.    I'm not trying to throw shade on passionate game devs and I truly love that there are so many games to choose from  but the amount of work and risk involved is so much different than most other jobs  that I understand why some devs have regular bouts of depression and drops in motivation.
289,And this is why I went with Dell after moving away from a micro center (No sRGB mode  but I bought colorimeter to calibrate it)   Dell customer support for high end monitors is pretty awesome. Sent a video of the issue  and they cross shipped a replacement that arrived couple days later  No one has time to deal with stuff like this
290,And we're back to the gripping 86 we're used to. Fortunately(?) we don't have many characters like Eugene who we have formed any attachment to  that are fighting for their lives. A major difference is the amount of warm light in the scene when Shin shoots Eugene. In a hidden away spot in the forest  there's more of a vibe of ... positivity? I can't pin the right word down. Rather than dying due to being forced to fight  it's Eugene fighting of his own freedom to protect his sister.  Resentment is starting to grow towards the 86ers in the Federation army. With their newly improved juggernauts  it seems like they are in place as special reinforcements to aid as things get bad. Goes to show how effective the 86ers are when they are actually given real support (which we saw a bit of with Lena's assist).  The Federation have developed their own type of Para-raid it seems  for which the 86ers seem fine with being able to live without all the time. Good to see they can move on at least a little. The memorial  Fido's return  and the return of Shin's gun all in preparation for the return to war. The Reaper is back  and the crew recognise it.
291,And what does Neo-Tokyo and Neo-Domino have in common?  Answer:  A card game decides what's what in politics  economics  and fate.  *Good player lives the high rich life in the center of the city.  *Inferior player lives in the slums and has to deal with hardships
292,Another great video.  He makes it looks easy diagnosing and rebuilding all that ancient fuel system stuff  and great news about the engine. Although I was halfway looking forward to a full engine rebuild since I dont think hes ever done that on any of his cars.
293,"Another pretty niche series is the Legend of Heroes : Trails series  starting with Trails in the Sky.  Pretty lore heavy turn based JRPG that gets very mechanic heavy as the series advances.  Each title takes somewhere around 50-70 hours so it really will take awhile since it's on its 10th or 11th title in Japan but 9 are localized or English patched.  It's more of a fantasy world with technology very similar to the modern era with trains  electricity  cars  giant railway cannons pointing threateningly  etc   The ""magic"" is the game is also a form of modern technology slotted onto a piece of portable machinery to assist in calculated magical phenomena."
294,Another super kyute episode! There was some clever shots this episode mocking Igarashi's breast size lmao. Their boss is a real one  letting Igarashi and Takeda have some time together  based. Kazama and Sakurai also sailing pretty nicely  that scene near the end was \[b\]hngh\[/b\] beautiful.         Natsumi  a tanned tomboy friend  this show has some top tier shit. Ripped grandpa is also great lmao. I wonder how Igarashi will ever get out of whatever zone she is in with Takeda  ganbare Igarashi.
295,any car  even a special one  is just a thing. things can be important  but compared to what keeping it would cost you  it's much better to move on.   The fortunate thing is that while you have an awesome car  it's not going to be hard to replace it down the road if and when the time comes. It'd be different if it was a unicorn or something.   That doesn't take away from how much it sucks now  but at least the market is right for you to get away from it
296,Any chance the chipset this uses supports AV1 decoding?  There are a few 70 dollar AndroidTV devices on Amazon now that do  though  other than the GPU/VPU on the chipset being powerful  I'm not sure I would want to buy those brands.
297,Any game can have controller support if you mess with Steam Controller Configuration.  Anyway  there's Dragon Age Inquisition  Knights of the Old Republic 2  Wasteland 3  Salt and Sanctuary  Grim Dawn.
298,Any good systems for profiling system requirements for games?  Any standards? Industry or otherwise?  We could really use a system for determining the minimum requirements for a game with better accuracy. I'm also curious how this works if it already exists. Especially testing the different video cards etc. because every small developer can't have a reference collection of cards.  Someone has to have solved this problem before  I'm curious of the implementation and how they did it.  Thanks for reading.
299,Any melee mage. Examples: red mage  battle mage  spell blade  night blade  blue mage.  Honestly any class that combines a mage with any traditional melee or physical damage is awesome  arcane Archer is great too.
300,Anyone in such dire mental straits to cheat at a ttRPG clearly needs that win. It's regrettable  but I personally consider such behavior a cry for help  so I don't give them too hard of a time about it. The farthest I go is making rolls happen at the table.
301,Anyone with basic knowledge of how LCD displays work knows that this isn't an issue  but that doesn't stop the anti-Apple brigade showing up to these threads like clockwork.  I see the same jelly scrolling effect on my 9th gen iPad when scrolling in landscape mode. That's because of the way that particular display is mounted.
302,"ao as you may know  certain electric trucks like the cybertruck and Hummer EV and the rivian r1t has it's""sank steer"" feature  what are your thoughts on them? are they good ideas? bad ideas? indifferent? what do you think"
303,Apparently  in Curse of Strahd  the mad mage (i.e. Mordenkainen  the planar hopping uberwizard)  >\[forgot\] his name and the world whence he came. In fact  he doesn't remember anything that happened before the madness.  Not because he cast ***Mind Blank*** on himself  you know  the spell that has 'mind' and 'blank' in the name (which also doesn't do what you think it does). But because  >he no longer has any hope of defeating Strahd or freeing the people of the vampire's damned realm.  ...who wrote this?
304,approaches 1) find usable photos similar to what you need  put them through an automatic pixel art converter (the good ones may be paid) and try out many palettes until you find a good one  2) make the game without backgrounds  launch on early access and use the money to comission  3) find someone willing to do revenue share  4) find someone willing to make one background for a Kickstarter campaign and then use that money to pay them. Or beg for money for one background and use that in the Kickstarter campaign
305,Archaelund is a game in development and it just looks perfect  it has a first person exploring but when you meet enemies it switches to an isometric view whit turn based combat.  It combines the devs old more simple game whit a new one whit huge amount of classes and a huge world.
306,Are there different varieties  or are they all intended to be the same type of ghosts with similar stat blocks? You could have them be detected by and made vulnerable by different methods that the PCs have to figure out. I'd be careful about how much and how heavy the ghosts attack before the PCs figure out the gimmicks though.
307,Are there people that actually believe WB and/or Turtle Rock Studios got some guy into a recording booth and told them to say the N-word in a zombie voice for the game?  This is not 1 person sneaking something like an easter egg into a game and unless Back 4 Blood was developed by the KKK  I think it's just people trying to make something out of nothing.  This will no doubt be patched out which will make them look guilty of a crime they didn't even commit   Gaming has enough actual shitty things going on without needing to invent stories.
308,Are u looking for their perfect parts for ur tasks at the pc or what is your exact question  sorry that I dont really understand.  But if it is ur question what are u using ur pc for? What is your budget? Is it important for u to build also a nice looking one?
309,Are we trusting Seagate this week? They and WD both brought out CMR NAS HDDs and then downgraded them to SMR.  And which can cause RAID failure  if you have a RAID that uses CMR and then replace a drive which may have the same model name and number as the other drives in the RAID but uses SMR instead.    https://blocksandfiles.com/2020/04/15/seagate-2-4-and-8tb-barracuda-and-desktop-hdd-smr/  Not to mention that I'm pretty sure that they've been caught swapping/downgrading SSD components without telling anybody or changing the model name  SKU or mentioning it anywhere.
310,Are you looking for it to be easy to take on/ off? If not you could either tint it really dark  or even just vinyl wrap it to completely block out light. Obviously this would not be something you can just take off easily if you want a bit of sunlight
311,Are you looking for something like summitracing.com? That doesn't realy exist over here. If you want a specific product  you go on the manufacturers website  search for a distributor in your respective country and order it from there.
312,Are you playing some broken version where your gamepad or keyboard isn't registering commands? Those are all core to the gameplay and something that most people stumble across within the first 10 minutes of the game.
313,Are you playing the games on a high enough difficulty? While I didn't play the ones you listed I know that a too low difficulty means you can skip parts of the combat mechanic simply because it doesn't matter and you win the fight anyway.
314,"Aren't you given that barony or whatever on ""nobody really wants this backwater place  so here you go  don't mind all the monsters and other weird things happening""?   That said  I didn't like the kingdom management part of the game either. Too repetitive and unbalanced at the end of the game."
315,"Around 2008-2009 I remember playing a top down arpg that featured a hero on the box art weilding a huge pizza cutter.  the game was centered around poking fun at other arpgs.  Some notable things I remember were legendary loot text being in a rainbow font and side areas called ""squeakeasies"" in the first zone.  Of course the enemies inside were rat people to fight.  Can someone shed some light on the name of this ARPG? its been haunting me as I just cant find it."
316,Art is just something that eats up a tonne of time to understand and get good at.  I've been learning with fundamentals and composition in mind  and I constantly improve  however my renders aren't quite where I want them to be for the kind of game I'm working on.     Practice is everything and it's an arduous path  I just wish I was in some kind of position where practising every day could be a part of working.      I'm just broke enough to not access tools that would make modelling profitable for me. Texturing software is pricy and I can't afford it.   I'm well-versed in creating procedural textures and original texture art in photoshop  but streamlined processes like Quixel or Substance are the way to go if you want to mass-produce useful content in blender to sell or use in your own compositions. Creating asset kits is a great way to practice while you create your content  but it's not necessarily profitable if you can't afford the software license ;P.
317,art is subjective  nobody can decide whether an anime is good or bad  Well it's true that opinions will differ  there are certain standards of writing and production quality that you can assess and anime by to roughly determine how good it is. And you can like anime while simultaneously admitting that it isn't particularly good. It's called having a guilty pleasure  and saying that an anime isn't good isn't the same as attacking people who like it.
318,Article in case of paywall:  Leuven is perhaps best known to the general public as the birth place of Stella Artois. Among chipmakers the Belgian citys biggest claim to fame sits in a squat building not far from the Leuven Institute for Beer Research. Metal banding lends its facade the glittering look of a silicon wafer etched with microcircuitry. Inside  its lower floors hum with the noise of $3bn-worth of some of the most complex equipment humanity has ever devised. The offices above house hundreds of the planets keenest semiconductor engineers dreaming up the future of chipmaking.  The building (pictured) is the headquarters of the Interuniversity Microelectronics Centre. imec  as it is better known  does not design chips (like Americas Intel)  manufacture them (like tsmc of Taiwan) or make any of the complicated gear in its basement (like asml  a Dutch firm). Instead  it creates knowledge used by everyone in the $550bn chip business. Given chips centrality to the modern economyhighlighted by the havoc wrought by current shortagesand increasingly to modern geopolitics  too  that makes it one of the most essential industrial research-and-development (r&d) centres on the planet. Luc Van den hove  imecs boss  calls it the Switzerland of semiconductors.        imec was founded in 1984 by a group of electronics engineers from the Catholic University of Leuven who wanted to focus on microprocessor research. In the early days it was bankrolled by the local Flemish government. Today imec maintains its neutrality thanks to a financial model in which no single firm or state controls a big share of its budget. The largest chunk comes from the Belgian government  which chips in some 16%. The top corporate contributors provide no more than 4% each. Keeping revenue sources diverse (partners span the length and breadth of the chip industry) and finite (its standard research contracts last three to five years) gives imec the incentive to focus on ideas that help advance chipmaking as a whole rather than any firm in particular.        A case in point is the development of extreme ultraviolet lithography (euv). euv is a delicate process involving high-powered lasers  molten tin and ultra-smooth mirrors. The bus-sized machines that generate euv are today all made by asml and used by tsmc and Samsung  a South Korean chipmaker. It took 20 years of r&d to turn the idea into manufacturing reality. imec acted as a conduit in that process. That is because euv must work seamlessly with kit made by other firms. Advanced toolmakers want a way to circulate their intellectual property (ip) without the large companies gaining sway over it. The large companies  meanwhile  do not want to place all their bets on any one experimental idea that is expensive (as chipmaking processes are) and could become obsolete.        imecs neutrality allows both sides to get around this problem. It collects all the necessary gear in one place  allowing producers to develop their tec
319,Artist and ex-web freelancer here. Ran a small boutique design studio for several years before got fed up lmao.   The only tools I ever get along with for game making are Gdevelop and Construct 3. Its just the way my brain is wired  I literally cant program a small game to save my life but was able to finish small games with Gdevelop and now working on a rogue-lite in Construct.   If my potato brain can do it  you can  too.
320,As a beginner  stay away from multiplayer. It makes everything exponentially more difficult.  The third one sounds like the only one of these which could be pulled off by a single developer in 3 years  as long as you don't succumb to feature-creep and try to add too many fruits.
321,As a former freelance web application dev who made the switch to Unity years ago  I feel your pain. Game development is hard  but it's also a lot of fun once you start to get a handle on things. I've been programming in some form or another for roughly 25 years and gamedev still felt daunting when I started; there are so many facets to the process that it's tough to put into words. The learning curve is steep  especially when working solo  so just keep in mind that the task you've assigned yourself is monumental and you should expect frustration: I have days where I want to slam my head into my desk even after almost 10 years with Unity.  My best advice: cut things up into smaller chunks of work and take short breaks in between; this gives you time to mull things over in the back of your noggin' rather than compounding things and feeling like there's too much to do at once. Prioritize your work pipeline above all else; nothing will make better use of your time than working efficiently  even if that means doing the same simple tasks multiple times to solidify the process in your head. Perspective is key: game's take months/years to create with a full team  so going solo is going to be brutal at times. Organization is also key: I would be absolutely lost without my Trello boards (free service I highly recommend).  I hope you keep at it if it's something you're interested in. Maybe you started off with an engine that isn't a good fit for you  or maybe your chosen engine uses a programming language that is raising the bar. Take a few days to get your head clear and maybe try a new engine to see if it's a better fit for your workflow. Taking time away from gamedev is as important as putting in time with the engine  otherwise there's no time for your brain to process and organize everything you've just learned.  Best of luck!
322,As a franchise? It's the trails series hands down. There are better individual games than some of the series but the continuity of story and characters between games is something I haven't seen done in any other game.
323,As a gamedev who tried making websites:  Nothing makes sense.  Website development is one clusterfuck of duck-tape-tied technologies that make no sense and are an absolute pain in the ass to work with.  Working in CSS is comparable to debugging shaders.  Someone  please fix the web. Make regular desktop apps drawn by browsers  idk...
324,As a German i really fucking hope it stays that way. Last real good thing about my country IMO. People ignore the fact that we have less crash related deaths on our Autobahn than countries with a general speed limit of 120 kph or 80 mph. Also not all sections of the Autobahn are without a speed limit. Most of the time you cant go that fast anyways due to traffic and it can be limited to 120 kph between 6 am - 8 pm aswell.
325,As a happy owner of the 10th gen hatchback I'm super split on the new one. For one  I absolutely despise the new rear in comparison to the outgoing gen. On the other hand  the interior improvements look impressive and all the reviews I've seen have praised the ride quality and noise levels - running 18s with a 40 sidewall makes cabin noise on long highway trips borderline unbearable.  Personally  I'm really hoping the new Integra takes the 11th gen platform improvements and makes a car that fits my tastes aesthetically.
326,As a hobbiest game dev that's been at it for almost 15 years  I only have one thing to say:  I tried to get into web dev about a year ago cause i was broke and jobless and I was basically in the same place you are now but in reverse.  Grass is greener on the other side  y'know?
327,As a ME/DA fan  I enjoyed odyssey immensely in spite of its glaring faults. Everyone has pm said all there should be said about odyssey. Expect fun combat  a gorgeous ancient Greek and the possibility of getting attached to the protag (altho some ppl didn't care for their kassandra/alexios but i did). Just don't expect the romances in odyssey to be in depth (don't even bother comparing them to ME/DA in that regard lmao) and for the motions (i.e. enemy forts/underground treasuresl to get repetitive af. If it's going for cheap  it'll easily fill up your time for months on end.
328,As a player  the only thing that bothers me is when GMs try to keep the same campaign with different rule systems. Legend of the Five Rings  tweaked most of the way through to a Powered By The Apocalypse homebrew.
329,As a player there is nothing more frustrating than never seeing the finale of a campaign. Never getting closure. Because of that when I started running games I took the tactic of running story arcs instead of long campaigns. Six month story arcs are my sweet spot for weekly sessions. Sometimes I do longer but 6 months is what I am for  In my group we do different settings and different systems pretty much every time we play. By doing story arts what usually happens is the games that people enjoy the most we will come back to and run more arcs later.  In the case of one campaign the characters reached a nice closure point but I left it open for an additional arc. The plan with that one is to use a different system and recreate the now adult characters in that system.  The biggest piece of advice I can give you is plan for shorter story arcs because you lose interest but also do not talk about or look at other game systems while running. We have that rule around the table. Nobody mentions the next campaign or talks about options for it until we are almost done with the current one. That creates the new shiny effect and we don't want that to happen.
330,As a rule the RPGs I enjoy having a close link to what genres I enjoy in other media. However I prefer RPG settings to utilize an entire genre instead of a specific property. Like how Vampire: the Masquerade is based on all of vampire pop culture  instead of being the official one for Anne Rice's Vampire Chronicles. Cause unless you're Star Wars  the setting of a movie is often way more limited than what I prefer for an RPG.  But as I said in a reply to a similarly themed thread last week; I'm glad these types of RPGs exist. Their favorite fandom getting an RPG might open people up to the possibility of playing something besides D&D. Helping to loosen the stranglehold it has over the hobby.
331,As a solo developer  the first time enter gamedev world  I feel coding & building game mechanic is hard  I try to learn from all the tutorial from youtube & udemy. Now building game your game mechanic feels easy.  When I seriously trying to make a real game  I realize I need to have some art skills  so I watch lot of blender tutorial  and I'm still sucks.. so I try to find the easiest way to make my own model  low poly is the answer.  After I'm done with the mechanic & art  I found a bigger problem.. it's game & level design  no shit  that thing is hard as hell and no tutorial can help me this time. I'm stuck for month  so play Genshin Impact instead. but wait.. this game kinda similar with zelda.. wait zelda is kinda similar with this game.. wait valorant is fucking copying CS. wait.. everybody copying thing from another game. That's it! I found the solution  let's copy some game and add our own twist..   But the most important thing is  be realistic.. if it's feels too hard  lets just cut our scope. I want to make characters with the same quality of genshin impact too  but I can't.. so I try to make something easier for me to make.
332,As a solo developer who loves Godot and uses it every day  I wouldn't recommend Godot to people who would have to look for a job in the industry.  You said you don't have time but you can use Godot again after making a professional career in your business. I have friends who use Godot for their personal projects at home and Unity at work.
333,"As a woman  anything to do with my gender. ""Oh  you just don't get it because [insert anime here] is made for men"" (or  even worse IMO  anything to do with calling the target a ""SJW"" or some similar term just because the target is discussing how an anime has poorly-written female or minority characters and/or shitty themes  completely flanderizing their argument by calling them a cheap buzzword. Random people on the internet aren't going to take away your fanservice anime just by applying basic media criticism to it)"
334,"As an actual game dev  most devs worth their salt code their own tools bc the available ones are shit. Unity ""upgrades"" at the drop of a hat and breaks all tools except your own which you can fix.   Indies also have it worst  they need to do music/foley sound design  graphics  game design  marketing  customer support  voice acting  server backend  monetisation  analytics  HR  accounting... With less than maybe 10 people. You need a code monkey and an artist with a part time accountant at the very least or be experienced geniuses like the Supergiant devs. Or you make tictactoe and 2048 I suppose. Definitely not Genshin Impact lol."
335,As an American  I admire the German driving system.    Theres clear standards for earning a license  unsafe jalopy cars are kept off the road ( relax Im talking about Swiss cheese frame Caravans  not your 240SX LS swap )   and everyones safer as a result. Thats why the Autobahn works there  and why an American Autobahn equivalent is impossible .
336,As an ex-theatre kid  this is very reminiscent of the feeling I'd get after ending a production. The bitter-sweet feeling that you are no longer working as part of a tight group to tell a story. I personally get a small echo of that when finishing a good session/arc/campaign to various magnitudes.  The only thing that helps me with that is reminding myself that we all did this cool thing  and we can and will do more cool things in the future. After that  you can start putting that energy towards making the next time great.
337,As anartist  let me tell you all there is no easy way to all of this. Imo art was harder to pick up than coding  because it's not a matter of somebody explaining something  and you using it. You have to study anatomy  environments  etc. Color theory is one part of it  but I just wanted to point out that art has a shit ton of aspects to it. Their isnt just 1 answer. There is no easy way. It you dont want to pay someone to do it  then practice.   This subreddit is mostly programmer oriented  so here is the perspective of an artist.
338,As fun as the old Speed3 was  I'd tell my 19 year old self to buy the 07 6/6 Accord sedan I was looking at instead. Maintain it to the same overkill standards I maintain everything else to  and just keep it and have fun
339,As I get older I find it harder to invest the time for these types of games.  I might only be able to manage 30 minutes here and there and often with work/family I won't get the chance to play at all for a week or so and I find it hard to get back into it.  I find I'm pretty good for games up to about 30 hours in length.  I would love another playthrough of Baldurs Gate 1 or Pillars of Eternity but I'm almost certain I'll not finish it or have to put it on hold for long enough that I forget what's going on.
340,As I non-web dev  I feel the opposite.  Sure I can make a crappy-looking html page with some javascript  but not full-stack dev with the latest trendy framework.   This is just stuff you have know how vs stuff you don't have know how. At least we don't have a shiny new game engine every 5 minutes.
341,"As if Apple gives a shit. They did it with the IPad  and refuse to do it with the IPhone. There's literally no point to an IPhone camera that takes ""amazing pictures"" when you can't transfer them onto your computer."
342,As if I ever moved towards D&D. Well  I have played some D&D over the decades  but it was just one of the many systems I played. It's far from perfect  and there are lots of things it doesn't do well. It's fine for the kind of game it's good at  and not so great for different types of games. I like variety.
343,As impressive as all the work being put in is  I remember thinking the same about Morroblivion. And thats basically finished now and looks and plays great. But poor optimisation (of course  but its still an issue)  and more importantly  near constant crashes made it just too much of a chore to actually play. Whole sections would become unplayable because of some arbitrary thing you didnt know you did that would just crash the game on entering certain frames or areas.  I cant help but worry that any mod on this scale is going to have the same severe stability issues that make it not worthwhile. Hope to be proven wrong if this ever launches though!
344,As long as it doesn't weigh a metric fuck-ton (looking at you TLX)  Acura might have a winner.  Fuck  slap SH-AWD on it (unlikely since the ILX never had it  but a man can dream..) and I'll hold off on giving up and just getting a SUV to replace my Accord.
345,As long as it fits the story and characters I'm good with it.   The only thing I hate is if game mechanics do not support it and  should the character return   letting its xp/lvl/job/etc. where they were when they left or barely compensated.
346,As long as you take the time to learn the combat system it's difficult  but fair.  Look up builds/demons and it can actually start to become easy unless you play on Hard where bad luck can still really mess you up.  Buffs/Debuffs matter - your enemies use them and so should you. This also means dekaja/dekunda are needed to remove any debuffs on you or buffs an enemy has on themselves.  Abuse the press turn system: attack foes with something they are weak to so you get an extra attack while avoid things they are immune/repel/drain to or you will lose your turn.  If your character dies = instant game over and there are instant kill attacks  but this can be negated.  You have items and spells (estoma  riberma) to make the encounter rate as high (riberma) or low (estoma) as you want.  I believe the new versions have an Easy difficulty you can use.  The only time I really needed a guide was the Puzzle Boy mini game.
347,As much as I'm for saving the manual (we own 4 manual cars) it would be more interesting to see them bring back the s2000 or create a new fun car (also manual required). The Integra was a semi sporty looking  bland commuter. We have plenty of that stuff right now.
348,As other have said  thats simply ridiculous. Sincerely someone who has run Hoosier racing slicks (peak grippiness) on a bone stock NA Miata (<100whp). Sounds to me like a wheel is bent or terribly out of balance. Definitely needs to be taken back to the shop.
349,"As others already pointed out  99.9% that the reason is a faulty tire or improper balancing work  since it's been mentioned that the issue happens at any speed regardless of gas pedal work.  At first i thought ""wheel hop""  which can INDEED happen under specific circumstances when you get **better** tires  but it only happens when you floor it and have a significant amount of power to produce enough wheel spin from whatever speed you're accelerating. Most likely not the case here."
350,As others have said  this isn't exactly new  but honestly I'm fine with both.  Totally original stuff is cool  don't get me wrong  but also  as a big fan of all three properties you mentioned  I also love the idea of being able to tell original stories in those settings with my friends.
351,As per usual  Apple being Apple  makes their phones harder and harder to fix through a 3rd party. This is why I will be using android well into the future  because I actually enjoy fixing and upgrading my phone.
352,As someone in a similar position (Enterprisey dev  not web)  I sat down and finished 90% of this tutorial: https://www.gamedev.tv/p/unity-multiplayer-coding-and-networking  I got a great foothold in a lot of basic implementations for unity  All the code made sense to me because of experience  but I didn't know the mechanisms I can use to approach problems.  Once you get through a good tutorial  you should be able to refer back to parts of it for specific issues you're running into.
353,As someone who does both computer and electrical work from time to time  I did a double take thinking this was some kind of awful IOT circuit breaker (https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Residual-current_device)
354,As someone who has played a lot of mmos this feels like a modern take on Final Fantasy 11 but with a pvp element to it. Its open ended and not really story based. Quests are kind of irrelevant.   While it is grindy. The fact folks were maxing out stuff in beta tells me its not that bad.   It is for sure meant to be played with others. You can solo it  but I feel like a month or two in would be boring alone.   I like it  but Im in a guild (company whatever) that is big in multiple mmos. So about 50 of us moved to this one just to start. So my experience will differ from someone just playing it to grind.
355,As someone who owns a fwd coupe  I wouldn't trade it for anything else because:  1) It's a less complex design (cheaper repairs) 2) Better traction in the winter 3) Looks better than what any 4 door will ever look like 4) I am not a father.. yet. 5) I have the ability to put people in the back in the 0.1% of times when the situation calls for it  6) The fact that I have a liftback means it can basically be used like a small pickup truck when the rear seats are folded down.   However  the premise of your question is wrong as there are 0 fwd coupes left in the market. The question should be  why there was such a large fwd coupe market in the 80s and 90s.
356,As someone who played the game at release  liked some ideas of it  but ultimately was unsatisfied  is it worth downloading it again now to give it another shot?  For reference I'm both a very longtime fan of BG1 and 2 and also a DOS fan so I feel like I SHOULD like this game.
357,As someone who started in Unity  I very much feel this about Unreal. I think the difference is learning how an engine works is important to understanding why your game doesn't work. If you're not sure how either work  almost nothing you do will work.
358,As someone with an 8-year development background (who was originally self taught but eventually did have to do the boot camp route to really learn  because self teaching only takes you so far)  programming is the tip of the iceberg of skills required for game development.  At this point  Ive accepted this is purely hobby. Im not an artist  videographer  musician  graphic designer  or mathematician. The most non-code skill I have going for me is as a Dungeons and Dragons DM  so maybe I have storytelling experience? Maybe? Please?  I make webpages  and that skill may transfer to C#  but it doesnt help with anything else.
359,As the title  so mostly towards GMs  but whats the thing you are most proud of that you have created  maybe its an NPC  a world  a city  a religion  even a really cool Tavern  doesnt matter how big or small  lets hear it!
360,As the title says I applied for a community college next fall for 2 years of game design. I wouldnt say I have the best experience but in my 6 years owning a pc i would dabble in some programs and all that out of curiosity and i did enjoy it i just didnt know much  but game designing and developing always intrigued me. I was just wondering if theres anything I can do from now to next fall that would help me in my future endeavors. The class will include doing animation I and II so I was thinking maybe I can start trying to learn beginner animation on my own? Any advice would be appreciated! :D
361,As the title suggests  I have a 2013 Nissan Maxima with the orange analog display. I was looking at the BOSS Audio line of touchscreen displays and wanted to see if I would be able to swap the old for the new. I want the display for mainly the Apple Carplay feature. I want to be able to wirelessly play music and display apple maps at the same time. Would there be any problems I would run into and is it doable?
362,As with anything it depends on your taste.  If your taste runs heavily to battle shonen I would say it probably isnt for you.  If you enjoy more characterization and nuance  and lots of emotion then you might appreciate it.  Personally I loved it.
363,As you can see your monitor also cuts the top part of your desktop view. There must be a setting somewhere to adjust the image to fit the monitor.  Might also be that your resolution was changed by the game you were playing and failed to revert back into the default - optimized one.  A restart wont fix this.  1. Check your resolution settings and make sure that you are using the correct one. 2. Check your monitor adjustments to make sure the image is not displaced by settings.     Usually monitors have something called *auto adjust* that among many things it will adjust the placement of the image within canvas.  Good luck.
364,Aside from avoiding the jerkiness  it could be fuel efficiency related. I remember I had a \~2018 Camry 4cyl that starts in 4th then would kick down to a lower gear like a maniac if you applied even a ball hair too much throttle. Took a lot of getting used to. I got some weird looks in traffic.
365,Aside from the ARPGs mentioned here and some CRPGs featuring real-time-with-pause  what you're looking for doesn't really exist. Western RPGs rarely feature highly detailed  interesting skill trees. Not to mention a large and varied class system on-top of said trees.  It's a shame really. I've been searching for years for the best skill-tree game and have landed on a roguelike called Tales of Maj'eyal. Currently around 800 hours played. It ticks absolutely zero of your boxes other than a variety of deep skill trees  though. You may have to broaden your search if you want some theory-crafting build porn.
366,Aside from the setting it doesn't really do anything that there isn't already an MMORPG doing. It also seriously lacks content. The only thing this game has going for it is its world PvP  if that's not your thing just go play ESO instead.
367,"Assume I want to play your game. I've played it previously  went through the coins included with an initial install  and quit. Now I start it up again  and I'm told that I need to play a minigame (or pay some money) to get more coins. It seems like requiring the player to do the minigame  when they want to play your arcade game  would feel like a chore. I'm not sure where the fun is  there.  And the ""coins for real currency"" just sounds like a monetization strategy rather than a gameplay element.  It might be a cute gimmick (when starting the game) to have the view approach the arcade cabinet  a coin go in the slot  then zoom in so the gameplay covers the screen  or something."
368,"Assuming you mean DOS1 and DOS2 since the first and third (don't ask) Divinity games will run on pretty much anything (the former actually got an HD ""remaster"" a few years ago in the form in a patch  so it plays great at 1080p).  My old PC was similar to yours and it could run DOS fairly well at 1080p  though not at max setting and I think the framerate stayed closer to 45 than 60fps  with some slowdown for huge cascade effects (fireball fireball fireball oh wait are those oil barrels--).  Never tried DOS2 but I imagine it would also run  though you'd likely have to tweak the settings a fair bit. And you can always tweak *beyond* what the game hardcodes  using third party tools. There's a YouTube channel called ""low spec gamer"" or something like that that's dedicated to getting games to run on hardware fare below minimum specs.  But  I mean  DOS2 can run fairly well on Switch  which is frankly *archaic* in terms of hardware  so it's definitely *possible.* You may just have to settle for min settings + 720p until you get that new GPU  tho."
369,At 40k I'd just get a WRX  lots of room  AWD  way more power  looks much better. 40k for a non SI civic is crazy  even for an SI that's a lot. I payed 40k CAD for my Veloster N.   The 40k price segment is way too competitive for a civic touring.
370,At first my 8gb ram was fine but then I noticed while I was in my performance taskbar and in system it says 5.93 gb usable. Is this normal? But my ram is 8gb  it sucks that it's only 6gb usable. Also. I don't have gpu just an integrated graphics  vega 8 graphics.
371,At last! I've got a first gen Paperwhite  and have been holding out for USB C to update. The battery in mine needs charging every week or so and it's my last micro USB device. I will be picking one of these up.
372,"At that point (level 4/just killing The Stagelord) you have NOT been ""handed a kingdom""  you are a feudal lord who has sworn to serve a higher lord (the Sword Lords). You are a minor Lord  not even a Duke.  People don't start calling you a King until a few acts later."
373,At that point it's just a tiny barony  not a kingdom. A barony with essentially no political power or clout or military or anything and is un-respected by all your neighboring powers.  They do a pretty good job making you feel like an _actual_ kingdom is still so far away as to be out of your grasp. That being said  I highly recommend the mod that makes kingdom management way easier by not taking weeks in-game to do things  letting you use that time to explore instead.  I think it's a great concept that they completely fucked up the balance of. Having to manage your barony is pretty awesome. Having to spend 60% of your in-game time limit sitting in a throne watching adventuring days pass is _not._   Luckily  as with most games  mods fixed it.
374,"At the time when it came out  there wasn't much party-based role-playing games  much less D&D adaptations. So this came with a lot of fanfare and somewhat satisfies the craving for a PC game based on D&D. It also features a somewhat ""new"" way of playing RPGs  via a top-down isometric perspective  much like an RTS at the time.   Now the genre has matured somewhat. If you've never played CRPGs before  I won't recommend you go all retro. The newer isometric RPGs has more QoL stuff and more satisfying mechanics. The first time I realized I could pick stuff up when playing Divinity: Original Sin was mind boggling!"
375,At this point all we're seeing from every new FSR vs DLSS comparison is the same conclusion repeated over and over again. I feel like it'd only be worth making further comparisons if either got an update  or if there was a particularly poor implementation.
376,Attack on Titan  Steins;Gate  Neon Genesis Evangelion  March Comes in Like a Lion  Vinland Saga  Cowboy Bebop  Madoka Magica  Monster  Fullmetal Alchemist Brotherhood  Great Pretender  Clannad  86  Violet Evergarden
377,Availability is at least there unlike most of the last year. You can buy a GPU from a retailer with a full warranty and easy returns and not off some scalper on ebay. But the price is still insanity.  EDIT: Im in the UK. Have a choice of any 3000 series card at most big retailers as long as im willing to pay the crazy price i can have one delivered today.
378,Awesome! Now put that passion and inspiration in to good use and start learning game development. We have all been in your shoes once where we were super passionate about our game dev ideas and ambitions but didn't quite know where to start since - let's be honest - learning game development and all the skills our requires is quite intimidating and confusing as a beginner. The only way to get past that is to keep working on it. If you need directions  this sub's sidebar has good resources for beginners.
379,Aye. That is a great drivers car.   I sold the car Id always wanted (in university) this year. A Mk 7 GTI. I loved everything about it. It only had 38 000 kms (23 000 miles). Still new!  After learning how to invest  and watching my index funds grow  I decided I wanted to focus more on growing my portfolio so I wouldnt have to work until dementia sets in.  I pulled the trigger and got a really good payout. Tears welled up in my eyes as it pulled away with a new owner. I was sad for two weeks. Then I realized that I became too attached. I used to fret about everything with that car. Now Im carefree with my current beater. Im still a car enthusiast - I just dont have to own them.  If you dont have what you want  want what you have. Cars come and go. Your relationship with your wife doesnt.  Youll find the next Miata again. Keep moving forward.
380,Back around 2002-2008 or so I remember playing a website based game that was only text based. The premise of it was to create a kingdom and choose a faction where you would spend turns/currency to reaserch spells  increase the size of your kingdom  train various combat units  or build support buildings. The factions were similar to MTG (magic the gathering) It was a very primitive black website. You could attack the people above and below you on the leader board to attempt to move up.    Does any of this sound familiar to anyone? The name insurrection or Armageddon sounds familiar but I dont think that's it.
381,Back when I had my '97 Express conversion van finding the right size serpentine belt was a huge PITA since there were so many belt drive configurations (because van)  depending on alternator amperage  dual alternator or not  A/C compressor size  engine type  etc.  The correct size belt would still sqeal constantly  so the only thing that fixed it was getting an ACDelco belt a bit too small and jamming the bastard on.  Also  this is not mislabeling necessarily  but I was doing some front end work on my car and I ordered some front sway bar bushings since I was doing the end links anyway  but for some reason the front bar on my car doesn't actually have serviceable bushings. I later found out my rear sway bar (tiny little thing) does have replaceable ones  but the front is in a welded bracket.  Wack.
382,Back when Model S came out people wanted an electric car. But with Porsche  you can get electric  quality  and a cooler styling (in my opinion). If Tesla ups their quality they can for sure get customers back.   Also  maybe people are burned of Tesla? They all look very similar
383,Back when the Integra was a thing  FWD was preferred over RWD because of handling in snow/bad weather. I think these days there is so much more traction technology and better tires and AWD drive available on any RWD platform that it's mostly irrelevant but that wasn't the case in the 80s/90s.   The coupe part was desired because 3 door > 4 door sedan. I moved myself to & from college every year by stuffing everything I owned as a human being into the back of my GSR. It was truly an amazing amount of space for such a tiny car.   That car was everything I needed as a 20 year old.
384,Bakuman is reasonably popular for an anime that finished nearly a decade ago  and is generally highly rated. It sees less discussion these days because the anime community tends to be laser focused on seasonals and there's not much that remains widely relevant in the community years later.  > finding it so unpopular makes me frustrated  You *really* shouldn't be investing any personal value or energy into how popular/well liked your favorite anime are because it has nothing to do with you  and there's nothing you can do to change it.
385,Baldurs Gate 2 was my very first CRPG. I also had zero experience with D&D. I played it long before the Enhanced Editions were released  and wasnt experienced with modding so I played it vanilla. I rolled a terrible druid because I had no idea what I was doing. But you know what? I took my gimped character all the way to the end of the expansion  finishing it. Trust me; youll be fine :)
386,Baldur's Gate and BG2 are great gamesespecially BG2.  Not knowing  or wanting to know  D&D will be a hindrance though.  Spellcasting is a central component of play  and one of the deeper systems in D&D.  I'm not trying to say you can't play without knowing/learning D&D  but I think it's going to be a more frustrating experience.  There's been a lot written about BG over the years  though  so there may be a walkthrough that makes it simple for you to experience the games at this point.  If I were going to recommend a crpg for first-time players  I'd go with Divinity Original Sin 2 or maybe Pillars of Eternity.  I think the story in both is pretty meh  but they're new-player friendly.  DOS2 has maybe the best tactical combat in all of crpg-dom.
387,Baldur's Gate was one of my first crpgs when I was a kid. I found it really tough and never really got far. When I came back as an adult and played it  some of the things I found tough as a kid weren't so bad  though the endgame was still kind of tough.  One thing to keep in mind if you get it is you have to do everything. If you don't get your characters fully leveled and geared  the last fight is going to be like smacking your face against a wall. Though I didn't like lowering difficulty  so maybe it becomes more doable if you do that.  I found Icewind Dale easier to get into  and I kind of liked the feel of it more  but it doesn't have as much characterization and story as Baldur's Gate  it's more of a D&D hack-and-slash.  I'll second the suggestions of Dragon Age: Origins (and the rest of the series - 2 is my favorite for story and characterization reasons) and Neverwinter Nights.
388,Baldur's Gate: Make sure you understand the dnd system.  Divinity OS is probably the best jump off point since hour long tutorials ease the player into the gameplay.  Diablo is more dungeon crawler than rpg.  Pathfinder has the same issue as Baldur's Gate learn the system first so you understand what you're doing.  Pillars of Eternity is very similar to Divinity on ease of entry imo.  Fallout 1 and 2 are a cross between Baldur's Gate where you'll want to learn the system  but you honestly only have to learn 2 things  all checks are chance to be successful and if you want to hit anything with regularity upgrade the skill to be 100% or higher.  Arcanum is something I'd put on the upper end of you'll just have to jump in and play and figure things out.
389,Bare handed brawlers/fighters.  Especially the type where you have a normal looking girl  but somehow she can hit for massive damage and crit often.  Like Alena in Dragon Quest IV or Ayla in Chrono Trigger.  Yeah  it's not realistic.  And that's why I like it.
390,Based on videos I've seen of people driving on the unrestricted sections of Autobahn  probably like 95% of drivers are already going about 70  75mph. Putting on a speed limit of 130km/h wouldn't change much.
391,Basic bitch answer most likely but Skyrim LE. If you dont mind using CDKeys (I can vouch for them 100% Ive used them a lot.) You can get OG Skyrim for 16$ with all DLC. You can mod it to run better and youll have access to quest mods like Skyggerfall (a recreation of Elder Scrolls 2s Main quest) or Beyond Skyrim Bruma. If you need help with modding  I can totally help. Id link the site for the CDKeys site but I dunno if Im allowed
392,"Basically anything that allows you to specialise in a type of gameplay especially if it uses some deep building system. Bonus point if it's an open world. I think the main theme here is freedom haha  I'm thinking very deep trees like path of exile or wolcen. I here that final fantasy xii zodiac age has this kind of mechanic but the ""automatic"" combat really drive me off  I've played dragon's dogma and loved it. Even though it's not as ""customisable"" as I'd like it was offering various gameplay experiences  I've also played divinity original sin 2 which was GREAT especially with the build system. However I'd really like something real time/action  Any recommendations? If I'm not clear feel free to ask!  Thanks a lot for reading and happy adventuring  gamers!"
393,Battle of Wesnoth has a free mobile port.  It's kind of a pain to control though.  Also more of a strategy game than RPG.  Vampire's fall is okay.  It has microtransactions  but I beat the game without ever paying for one.  Dont bother with the multiplayer portion though  that's all PTW.  King of Dragon Pass is an amazing game.  You'll need to look up a guide to actually understand the mechanics  and also a little hard to control.  It's a pc game ported to mobile.  Pixel Dungeon and its various clones (I prefer soft pixel dungeon) are good roguelikes.
394,Be a Mage.  They have the best intro chapter  they learn the coolest lore  and they are OP as combatants.  Late in the game if you want them to become fighters  they can  and then they are the best at that too.  Take Morrigan  but don't be her simp. You'll hate yourself *and* she won't respect you.
395,Bear in mind much of their adoration is because they come from a time when they were basically the only party based RPGs.   Compared to the recent Pathfinder games and Dragon Age they are incredibly bare bones being based on AD&D 1+2 where gameplay options and character customisation are much slimmer. Basically every character apart from magic users are just one button wonders. The writing has snippets of good  basically the opening of 2 and any scene with Warner  but it is a lot less character driven than people remember or that fans of modern Bioware will expect.   They're certainly not bad but there are better first time party based rpgs out there. Dragon Age Origins plays a lot better with much more active combat and much more personality in writing. Divinity Original Sin 1+2 are fantastic games that are bursting with clever ideas. Shadow Run Dragonfall is a super streamlined rpg that still has a lot of freedom in how you play and a lot to like in terms of writing and is comparatively bitesized for a CRPG at about 15 hours.
396,Because the integra coupe was cooler than the integra sedan...   I have no doubts it will debut as a sedan with a coupe option added later (just like the civics its based on) but honestly I just want a 2dr integra as my daily/commuter because I want something engaging to drive (with a Honda manual gear change) that isn't crap to look at and is somewhat fuel efficient. 99% of the time it's just me in the car  and I like how a coupe looks vs a sedan  plus people won't ask me to drive them places if I lie and say the back seats are too small.
397,Because you mention anime games  you could play Tales of games. Tales of Arise just came out but try Vesperia  Graces f (for PS3) and Xillia (PS3). There is also Tales of Symphonia for PC and Tales of Abyss for a PS2 emulator. Those are pretty good. Aside from that  definitely not hidden gem but Devil may cry 1 and 3 are great. There are some rpg elements but nothing crazy specially in 1.  Shadow warrior is a great game with rpg elements as well. Shadow warrior 2 even more adding looting systems.   You could argue that Yakuza games are action RPGs in a broad sense. Yakuza 0 is a good entry point and the best action game of the series.
398,Been a little while since I played Dishonored  but after skimming through the English rulebook looking for answers:  &#x200B;  1. Don't think that's possible. You can generate chaos to prevent a truth from being created when a complication is supposed to happen 2. The English version of the rulebook just says that it needs to happen after an NPC has rolled 3. Took some digging but you're right  it does say that  but not how much it should cost.   &#x200B;  I enjoyed Dishonored  the game flows well during actual play and the setting is cool  but the book could have used an extra round or two of proofreading. Lots of faulty page references in it as well.
399,"Before Roger Moore became James Bond  he starred in this British spy TV series called The Saint  and in it his character drove a Volvo P1800. That car is pretty commonly known as simply ""The Saint""  it is very much linked to that TV series."
400,Being a commander of something in CRPGs in general is geting old for me. It was cool at start  like having your own castle in Neverwinter Nights 2 or gathering an army in Dragon Age: Origins. But now I'd just like to go back to just being a group of adventurers  always on the move and never bothering with buildings in their base  economy and politics.   It's a great idea in theory  but it always comes down to minigames. In the new Pathfinder we have Heroes of Might & Magic minigame  if HOMM was terribly unbalanced. I haven't disabled it yet. Sometimes it's fun  sometimes you spend 15 minutes attacking a gargoyle or watch your army wiped out by a single spell.    As for the roleplay  it's also hit or miss. Sometimes being a judge and commander is fun  sometimes it's weird. So a king abandons his kingdom  leaves his army and goes to risk his life  personally searching for artifacts in some dirty cave? Or you're telling me  that the most uncharismatic and dumb as bricks half-orc barbarian knows  how to manage a kingdom?    Imo being a small ship commander is maximum that makes sense in CRPGs  like in Assassin's Creed Odyssey or Pillars of Eternity 2. But once you have a whole army and kingdom treasure at your disposal  every personal adventure or financial struggles sound silly.
401,Being more critical is an element  but depending on how much you're playing it could also be burnout. I used to love the Assassin's Creed games and they're still fine  there were just so many that were only marginally different that I just felt like I was playing the same thing over and over.  There's no shame in taking a break from a genre of game or gaming in general.
402,Being open to newer and/or different games is probably what you're going to have to do. It comes down to if you're at all interested in newer games or not as there's no sense in playing a game you don't want to. I'm going to disagree with the other commenters here and say I've experienced the same problem you've had with getting an icy reception from younger players  regardless of game system. I'd recommend a solution if I had one but I'm afraid I don't. It sucks getting old.

404,Belt in the tire got displaced or the tire wasnt balanced well. No matter what I wouldnt take the car back to them because theyre trying to rip you off with a dangerous tire or theyre just super lazy.
405,Best and most up-to-date emulator right now is Beetle  which you can run through [Retroarch](https://www.retroarch.com/).  If you're concerned about piracy  most PS1 emulators let you load games straight from your disc drive. Might take a little longer to load from there but it's legal.
406,BEST BOI IS BACK! The grand entrance with the 3D pan shot  The way Shin trashed the Vanagandr so non-chalantly though MAKE DAT BEETLE BOUNCE  Also RIP Eug/ene  the scene was so much bloodier than in the LN! Im surprised they went there considering the toned down graphic violence so far. The dent in his glasses looked like a tear as well. So many little details  hard to name it all on the spot.
407,"Between zero and several hundred million $. It depends on several factors:   * size of your target audience * your marketing budget and how accurately you hit your target audience with it * brand recognition * game's overall quality  I mean  you can make a game about catching monsters in balls and have no one play it. But just put that ""Pokemon"" in the title and even without almost any innovative ideas compared to last version you sell 20+ million copies.  Now  if you want a decent starting point - first  figure out what are other similar games at given pricepoints. Unfortunately I can't really help you with this as I can't think of any single player FPS-es built on low budget that succeeded lately but it's also not my preferred genre so I could simply be missing some titles. Then see how many reviews games comparable to yours have. You can then assume that number of copies sold is around 20-40x the reviews.   It's not super accurate but it's a decent starting point. Eg. if you check out Hollow Knight - you will find it has 157k reviews. This times 20 is about 3 million copies sold. It has officially sold in 2.8 million copies back in February 2019 so it wouldn't surprise me if it was around 3-4 million copies by now so this actually checks out.   Factorio officially sold in 2.5 million copies and it has 101k reviews. So it's roughly 25x multiplier. Do note that these two are exceptions and top 0.1% performers  don't expect this level of success.   Something like Momodora (so a smaller but still successful game) has 8k reviews meaning it probably sold between 150 to 300k copies.   Looking at the raw numbers:  https://vginsights.com/insights/article/infographic-indie-game-revenues-on-steam  Apparently 59% of indie action games tend to make between $0 to $10000."
408,Beyond what everyone else have already said  Baldurs Gate isn't really a difficult series to get into  it's fairly straight forward and was designed in a way to allow people with no knowledge of D&D to play the game.     However what no one has mentioned  which is a semi-requirement  is to **READ THE MANUAL**. Do that  and everything will be fine(Ability descriptions etc are all found in the manual  the manual  is your go to source for all information).
409,Big bore plus small stroke is how you get a really peaky powerband with tons of revs. The bigger the stroke  the more distance the piston actually has to travel.  Go the other way for big torque low revs.
410,Big-budget IP RPGs don't take anything away from the original and indie stuff. There are already more RPGs in existence than anyone could possibly ever play  so everyone is already making choices about which games are best for them. The worst thing that can happen is that the big-budget games are terrible and no one plays them; and if any of them turn out to be good and worth playing  that's a net positive.  Frankly  I think anything that has a chance of getting a 5e-only player to branch out and try something different is good. The near-monopoly that 5e has is far worse for the community than the Avatar RPG.
411,Biohazard and village were great. But the gold standard of RE for me is what they had with Re2 remake. Tense horror  heavy exploration  slower paced combat and a story and characters that aren't super over the top.
412,Blackbirds rpg is currently on kickstarter and runs on the zweihander engine.  Berserk is one of the biggest influences on the game's development.  Has less than 36 hours left.  I am not associated with the project.
413,Blacksburg Tactical Research  The Riddle of Steel  Phoenix Command  Hackmaster (one of the versions is way better than the other)  Role Master / Space Master / Merp  Rifts  Some of them you can get free  like Role Master from ICERPG.  I don't mind Ad&d  but you need to be happy with the system to make that call.  Also games like Necromunda 1e and Flames of War shouldn't be discounted either.  Tyvm
414,"Blades in the Dark might be a good fit. It's about a gang  or ""crew""  of ne'er-do-wells to expand their wealth  power  and influence in a sort of Lovecraftian steampunk city. A cool aspect of it is that not only do the players have their individual PCs  but the ""crew"" itself is a sort of meta-character with a class  levels  upgrades  etc.   The rules are simple for players  a little more complex for the GM (though still simpler than DnD 5e in my opinion). The game is also very flexible  doesn't require any prep  and works well even when all players don't show up. To highlight the flexibility of the game  for one crew the game might focus on unionizing the city's workers and overthrowing the government  while for another it might be on running a demonic drug smuggling ring."
415,Blood: Lets step up your training a bit.  *Drops Will off in the dungeon and leaves.*  Damn  thats one hell of a step up in difficulty from defeating a single skeleton.  I wonder what Gus is hiding from Will though
416,Boot with seatools  run full diagnostics. If thats good  Boot with kaspersky rescue disc and run the malware scan  Or  Get the HP restore software and factory reset it   google had an update  sounds sus
417,Bootlooping is often caused by memory error  try reseating RAM and try each stick individually  Try resetting the CMOS battery too  If thats not the problem  the next things I would look at would be the motherboard and PSU
418,Both are useful and learning one will teach you principles that apply to the other  so no time is wasted either way. I did the same and landed a job for enterprise software in C#. However  my first job was with Python in a uni lab. I still use python for certain tasks.
419,Both Torment games (warning: reading is MUCH more prevalent than action). Disco Elysium seems to be great (have not played it myself). Grim Dawn has a grim setting.  Tyranny might be what you are looking for - dark and unforgiving.
420,Bought a 200 audi avant  i knew it was pretty rare to begin with so i contacted audi of USA to check my vin and they said it's 1/4 with the options it has.  Pearl white exterior and nautical blue sport seats which were all extra options at the time. Seems to be kind of appreciating recently so I'm happy with that
421,Bought a 98 integra type r with 11k miles for 22k in 99. Sold it with 44k miles for 22k two years later. Saw one sell for over 80 on bring a trailer in the last few years. Have a focus RS currently and theyre starting to creep up. Not necessarily a great indicator because it sold for charity but the first one in the states sold for 550k. Wish I had the $$ to just put it away.
422,Bought an 01 BMW 330Ci MT cabrio 3 years back as a summer beater to have cheap fun for little money. When I look now  finding a clean one is becoming difficult and when found  prices are around 8-10k.
423,Bought my cousins Honda Element about 2 years before the price started to seriously climb. Manual  under 60k miles. Virtually perfect condition.   Only bought it to help my cousin financially - he wouldnt accept just money. Drove it a bit and kept up on maintenance; it really just sat in the back of the garage waiting for cousin to rebuy.   When he didnt want it back  I sold it for close to 10x what I bought it for. Worked out very well.
424,Bought my delidded/binned 7700k from them  and most recently sent in my 10850k to have delidded. Both still running nice and cool today. Sad to see Silicon Lottery go  but it's understandable why.  I have yet to OC my 10850k but don't see much point since everything I play doesn't really stress it. I mostly got it delidded to help that extra little bit with temps so it runs nice  cool  and most importantly  quiet.
425,Bravely Default will test your limits on just how much story you want from a game.  But it fits your description.  Also a lot of character customization through the jobs.  I'd also suggest playing Dragon Quest V since you liked the other ones  but it doesn't have character customization.  It has a different kind of mechanic I won't spoil.  KOTOR is a WRPG and fits your wants very well.
426,Brindlewood Bay has a step by step guide to how to run a session within its ruleset. It also has a built-in campaign arc  so you don't have to worry about that(and also rules for a one-shot). You as gm would probably just need three sheets of paper  one for the current mystery  one for the overall campaign(conspiracy sheet)  and a move reference sheet(what the players can do).
427,Bro I'm a very big attack on titan fan and i also had been searching for animes that might match my taste  I watched MHA then but didn't like it  Then I came across some real gory horror animes  U can recommend ur mother watch shiki. Shiki is a very gory and dark horror anime but has an above average story.  Ur mother may also like Promised Neverland. PN is not much of a gory anime but has a good story and is pretty Dark too.  And If u r an Attack On Titan fan then u can watch Hunter X Hunter. the anime has some comedy and stuff involved but in some points it gets really gory(like a kid taking out some one's heart) and Dark and Phycological horror. It also has an excellent story.  After attack on titan HXH my second most favorite anime
428,Bubblegum Crisis is hosted on Animeigo's official site and Cyberpunk 2020 has Shiropunk mods. I wouldn't look further if early '90s cyberpunk is what you want. Gurps also had the famous book that was confiscated by the government.
429,Buck up!  As far as we know  in the entire lifespan of the entire universe  it has never been easier to make games than it is *right now.*  Keep at it!  And don't be afraid to reach out!  There are a lot of gamedev communities (including this one!) that are pretty friendly to newbie questions  if you ever need to just talk out how to approach a problem!  Best of luck!
430,Bug Fables. Indie game inspired by the classic Paper Mario RPGs. It is absolutely a fantastic game. Mechanically I'd say it's even better than the original Paper Mario's. Lots of depth to the combat and medals/badges. Excellent writing and level design too.
431,Buy from a brick and mortar retailer and get a pdf  or pay more for the convenience.  https://arcdream.com/home/about-us/free-pdf-guarantee/  Also  Delta Green has a reddit.  https://www.reddit.com/r/DeltaGreenRPG
432,By built for OC they dont mean built for gamers who want to OC. They mean built for people whose sole purpose is trying to top benchmark leaderboards. Theres a bunch of aspects about this board that make it not great for actual use but optimize the hell out of a potential benchmark.
433,"By retro  I mean PS1 or earlier.  Maybe GBA or PSP  too.  Something easy to emulate and fast-forward through stuff if needed.    By ""good pacing""  I mean I want it to have a strong start and not too much downtime in the main quest.   I want it to feel like the story is getting somewhere and my party isn't useless until they reach level X or get Y amount of money.   I would prefer not to spend 40 minutes in exposition dumps or talking to everyone in town for the one NPC who will let me out of town.      *Here are some games I enjoyed:*  - Final Fantasy 1-10  except 2.    -Dragon Quest 1-11  except 7.    -Phantasy Star 4  -Bravely Default (still waiting on sale for sequel)  -Divinity: Original Sin 2  as long as I have a co-op partner to carry all the vague town and quest stuff  and point me at the enemies.    -Etrian Odyssey series  -Grandia series  -SMT series and Persona 2  -Shining Force 1&2  -Breath of Death & Cthulu Saves the World  -Barkley: Shut Up and Jam Gaiden  -Mario RPGs before Intelligent Systems screwed the pooch.    -Battle Chasers Nightwar  *Here are some games I didn't care for:*  -Phantasy Star 1-3-   Finished 1 but it was a slog.  2 and 3 were just too grindy with an overly vague main questline.    -Baldur's Gate 1&2-  Draconian inventory restrictions and clunky menus drove me off before I could get any taste of progress.  I lost patience with both before I could get my first level up  even on Easy.    -Cosmic Star Heroine-  mainly because of difficulty balance.  Higher difficulties felt like they only had one way to win battles.  Otherwise it felt like nothing I did mattered and anything was a free win.    -Xenogears-  cutscenes so long you have to save in the middle are a party foul.  Sewer level flushed away all my motivation.    -Warriors of the Eternal Sun-  Zero Accuracy Simulator. At Level 1  D&D is just Depression & Depression.    -Might and Magic 3-  couldn't figure out where I was going with the clunky SNES menus.  Tried and failed to start it about 5 times now.    Anything else I could play?    Thanks in advance."
434,C3 corvette. Not necessarily unreliable but overall pretty poorly built with a sub par drivetrain and driving experience. Absolutely love the looks of the car and I want to love it so badly  but they just handle poorly and have limited power hence why theyre as affordable as they are.
435,Call of Cthulhu is great for one-shots  because proper genre emulation demands that most of the party end up dead and/or insane by the end of the adventure  and that's much easier to do with the throw-away characters of a one-shot adventure.    Oh dang  we need a Lovecraft hack of Lasers & Feelings. I'll have to think about that!
436,Can I just say how fucking annoying cable buying is?  Firstly getting short cables seems impossible  I need a 10cm C7 cable and I might as well be drawing blood from a stone.  Same with HDMI  but I want a 90 degree connector and short.  Honestly it'd be nice to have some cable configuration to get semi custom cables.  Select type  Select length  Select quality (FHD  UHD  8K  etc)  Select one end connector type  Select angle  Select other end connector type  Select angle  I know there'll be a ton of binning but the thing is these cable exist  just Amazon is filled with 100 nearly identical 1m HDMI cables and anything specific is made by some weird offbrand.  It'd just be nice for whatever bulk manufacturing company sets up a website ls because I'd love to upgrade all my cables.
437,Can we know which laptop it  is   But regardless a laptop which gamed on requires more care than normal ones . You need to open the laptop and clean the dust from the fans  once you have done that You have to buy isopropyl and gelid gc extreme(thermal paste) and change the thermal paste in this laptop
438,Can you recommend me an anime to watch with my mommy plz??  Bro you're a fucking loser  she doesn't want to watch your Asian cartoons  she's just happy that you have a hobby outside video games and jerking off in a dark room and wants to spend time with you. Grow the fuck up and ask her what she wants to watch instead.
439,Can you share your experiences with GameLand  Magicraft or SkyGame as manufacturing partners?   I'm looking to Kickstart a tabletop game that I've been working on. I'm currently talking to several manufacturers and have narrowed it down to GameLand  SkyGame and Magicraft. Does anyone have experience working with any of them? What was the quality of their components  printing and customer service in your experience? Were there any unexpected challenges and if so how did they address the issue(s)?
440,Can't agree more  SH: Covenant is my 'favoritest' JRPG of all time as well. I absolutely love its story  characters  music  gameplay  graphics and art style. I just wish the whole SH series would have been remastered on the newer gen consoles some time soon.
441,"Can't help with the yt marketing  but the steam page isn't stellar. The game is apparently about restoring the planet  but every single one of your screenshots and videos is of an orange junkyard. Not much ""transformation""  tbh.  For reference  Terra Nil ([https://store.steampowered.com/app/1593030/Terra\_Nil/](https://store.steampowered.com/app/1593030/Terra_Nil/)) is a game in the same genre  and it has a great steam page that you could take inspiration from."
442,Car alternators are rated at about ~150A. I measured the current generating rate of the alternator at idle using a diagnostic app and it showed ~38A being generated. At the same time I hooked up a clamp DC multimeter at the battery negative terminal to measure current and it showed a ~5A rate (charge since its positive at -ve terminal). Even after revving the engine it doesnt change much. So why is the battery only charging at 5A and whats the point of such a huge alternator capacity ?
443,Car appreciation seems really neat until you realize that it'd be even more profitable to just invest in an index fund  I drive all my cars as much as I wish and re-sell them after a bit  knowing they won't lose value. But I have no interest in holding onto them for the gainz  as the opportunity cost is too high
444,Cars have been a lifelong fascination of mine. It's what my one-track mind defaults to thinking of. When I was a kid  like 6-7  I could draw my dad's 2000 Honda Odyssey better than I could draw people. Now  I'm planning to make inroads for asset modelling so I could start modelling original designs for video games.   But it feels a little disingenuous to call myself a *car guy*. Not in the mechanical sense at least  and for now. I don't know how to do an oil change or what point to place a jack if I have to change a wheel. I won't be able to name 95% of the parts in an engine bay. I don't know crap about drag or aero or tuning or how to stiffen suspension or why the Subaru EJ series blows head gaskets (or how to fix that). I tune out on spec sheets in review videos. And I'm not serious about design in the sense that I would want to make one from the ground up.   I've spent most of my life surrounded my bicycles. I enjoy it. There are conveniences to owning one in the city compared to driving that I value immensely. I like wrenching on mine  and tuning it and adding accessories and such. And with the way the world is headed  I might be stuck to it longer than I expect. But I gravitate towards the car. I'm obsessed with studying car design. I like critiquing  I like seeing how I could be able to change or adjust them to look  from my point  better. I'm waiting for the day I can start driving instead of riding or walking in the rain or waiting for hours in the dead of night in the frostbitten winter for a bus or a cab. I'm an enthusiastic participant in the externality of car culture  even when I don't understand a good chunk of what's said here a lot of the time  and I'm eager to learn.
445,Challengers for sure  especially 2015-present ones. Theres a reason they still sell well after 12 years of production. Demons will probably be treated the same as the old 426s  while the hellcats and redeyes will probably be a little less desirable just cause of the name
446,Change it up. I like RPGs but I play other games like Borderlands 3 and Horizon Zero Dawn. Im playing through Arkham City right now. Or read. I have book backlog to go through. Or workout. If you study working out you can learn a lot about it from YouTube. Wish I had YouTube when I was younger
447,Changes from movie:  -opening scene with the master has been removed  -Boarding scene has been removed  as it was in episode 1  -title card transition is removed(of course)  -new still of Rengokus face  -Rengokus first umai now sends a shockwave down the train instead of shaking the window  -Rengoku umai is extended to show the boxes falling on each other  -new scene between Rengokus fights(I have 0 clue what it means other than more spooky)  -new ending where the train enters the mist  These are all the ones I captured  may be more changes  EDIT: THIGNS MISSED  -they removed the scene of tanjiro being a helpful bean to the old passenger  -there is a new still of the empty bento boxes after the OP
448,Changing systems is good for you! I recommend trying different and new systems  it makes everybody better unless its like what you describe  in constant and unfinished flux. Thats a red flag for me as a player! Set a time for your campaign  maybe on the shorter side and plan for a self contained story on that time.
449,Check out **Greedfall**.    It's not a AAA game  but the storyline and characters are there  and the gameplay is pretty good.  Excellent voice acting.  Its failings include egregious asset reuse and subpar graphics.  It gets a little long in the tooth at the end  but after \~50 hrs to complete the game  I'd recommend it.
450,Check out handmade hero. It's a very experienced developer making a commercial game from scratch in C with basically no libraries  all of it is streamed live and he's been doing it for 5 or 6 years consistently.  https://handmadehero.org/  I also just started a weekly stream (1 episode so far) doing a game engine from scratch but in Golang  which you can find here:  https://twitch.tv/bloeys  It's definitely doable and enjoyable process that teaches you a ton  but it's also hard and very very long  so it depends on what you are aiming for  but it never hurts to try it at least once.  Good luck!
451,Check out Midwestern Auto Group just outside of Columbus  Ohio.  www.magcars.com  Not only are they a VW dealership  but also:  -Audi  -Bently  -BMW  -Ferrari  -Jaguar  -Lamborghini  -Lotus  -Land Rover  -Maserati  -Mini  -Porsche  -Rolls Royce  -Saab  -Volvo   I know they're also one of the few service centers in the country that are qualified to work on certain high end vehicles. When I was there getting work done on my GTI a few years ago  they took me in the back to check out a 918 Spyder that had just gotten shipped in for a yearly service.
452,Check out Numenera. It's a really simple system with a great setting. There are two free quickstart adventures that don't take very long to get up and running.  https://www.montecookgames.com/store/product/the-spire-of-the-hunting-sound-quickstart-adventure/  https://www.montecookgames.com/store/product/ashes-of-the-sea-pdf/
453,Check out some of the many You Tube video compilations of ghosts.   One thing that I've seen on these is ghosts reflected in a mirror on a photo.   Orbs of light  like moths picked up on a video camera.  Unexplained sounds.(e.g footsteps)  Passing shadows in a rom or at a window.  Moved objects. (Motion detection devices  items left to help the ghosts to indicate their presence).  A psychic character who can pick up on them and tell the group. (as per Most Haunted')  Moods influenced by the ghost  or even possession.  Batteries and people drained of energy.  Misbehaving lights.  Hearing voices when it's impossible  or not hearing someone call when you should be able to.  Ghost hunting tech for ghosts to speak through or show up on  (as per 'Ghost Adventures')
454,Check out the current [Blackbirds Kickstarter](https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/andrewsmcmeel/blackbirds-rpg)  it ends soon but the campaign starts with a Berserk quote and is pretty on theme.  edit: oh i see i'm no the first to post this.
455,Check out the T5s from volvo. Awesome engines they made for decades. Really good for tuning if you look into it  especially in Sweden. I5 have a beautiful sound and are great for turbo (that was Volvos thing before it was cool - large consumer cars with turbos). with the transverse you have the easiest set up to work on ever
456,"Check out Wwise and FMod  both are free sound management programs that do the same thing. May be some difference in their free licenses so check that out. You can accomplish what you want via coding but FMod and Wwise make it easier IMO.  To answer your question most audio sources in engines will already work by distance  but again it can be set it FMod and Wwise  editing the drop off  etc. If you want to avoid those in your game engine you should be able to edit an audio source/listener to be by distance.  As far as echo / adding distance to sounds  that is what is called ""reverb"" in the audio world. It's how you can make sounds sound like they are in a cave or room  or if you want them to be pushed into the back/rear of what you are currently hearing  without lowering the sound level.  In Wwise and FMod you can do cool things like setup triggers/collision boxes to tell the sound to add reverb. You can even adjust how much reverb by other variables like distance  or whatever you can think of. It's how car engine noises are made in games also  speed and acceleration of the engine determines how loud the engine gets  when it transitions to a more intense engine noise  etc. All of that stuff can be automated.  Would highly recommend checking out some intro videos for Wwise and FMod where they implement some sound. It not only will show you the workflow  but how you should be thinking about sound."
457,Check r/lfg there's loads of people looking for games there. There's also specific game communities  discords and the like. Roll20 is the main free virtual tabletop out there  so if you want maps you may want to add that plus discord for vc.
458,Check to make sure the wheels are actually torqued to the hub  then check for balancing  but usually balancing issues show up between 80-120km/h(40-70mph). It's unusual for a Michelin to be bad from the mold as their QC is really good but it happens.    The side effects of grippy tires are generally sharper steering response and worse gas mileage  maybe a bit of tramlining or following ruts. Find a new mechanic after this fool fixes it for free
459,"Chessex makes great vinyl battlemats in a variety of patterns  including hexes. Regarding the bases: you don't actually need hex bases to use a hex grid. All you need is to be able to determine which hex a figure is in  and which side it's facing. Most minis will have an obvious ""front"" direction  and if they don't  you can just paint a white mark on."
460,Chevrolet used an I5 Vortec in some of the mid 2000s Colorados  haven't heard much about it though regarding reliability. The Volkswagen 2.5 I5 is probably one of the most reliable gasoline engines they've produced  and they sound fantastic imo.
461,Christ no. It would be a cringe fest like the animated version they did. But also; they seriously dont seem to understand what made ff7 popular  the narrative and character development is non existent in extended media and even the one good one (crisis core) is filled with claptrap that jars with the story they had in 7.   If anything though  some jrpgs would be excellent tv shows - vandal hearts 2 would be the original game of thrones in a way  murder  rape  looting  political schemes all the way through.  But tv shows run out of money as viewership declines and something as long as a jrpg in a tv show would absolutely go the way game of thrones did imo.
462,Chrono trigger definitly on snes since you haven't listed it.  Try live a live on snes  its only available as fan translation only but its really fun  i didn't see the time pass when i complete it.  Maybe golden sun on the gba.
463,Chrono Trigger originally on the SNES  so it shouldn't be hard to find an emulator of it. But a remake version was released on Steam  Final Fantasy. The most famous is 7  my personal favorite is 9. I am not going to say play ALL of them (I honestly don't think all of them are that good). So I am going to recommend 6-9. 6 was on the SNES so you should be able to find an emulator for it. 7-9 can be bought on Steam.
464,Classic Chrysler 300 changed the letter and kept the 300. they skipped 300 i but used every other letter up until 300L in 1965. So each car was a different version of the same car with a different name for each iteration.
465,Closest thing I can think of is the Shadowrun games which are more cyberpunk than modern. Maybe some of the Deus Ex games  but again that's a stretch compared to what you're asking for. Disco Elysium isn't fantasy but it's a fun modern rpg. If you're willing to go even further away from fantasy you could try Sleeping Dogs or the Yakuza games
466,Commented on the YT video but figured I'd also drop this here:  Awesome to see  makes me appreciate owning a Fractal Design case even more (Meshify C Mini) and I'm strongly considering getting the Torrent at some point for a different build.         I'm curious though  now that we've seen multiple instances of through holes being related to shorts (obviously bad design being the actual issue) is this something you guys might test going forward? Seems like a easy thing to test for PCI-e risers or fan hubs (or whatever else) that lack plated through holes by just scratching the protective layer on top where a metal screw would sit to see if there's any risk whatsoever of shorts happening in the future (likely through multiple installation cycles)
467,Communicate through programmable LED lights that can shine on the floor. Though I can see how it might be open for abuse.  When I'm thanking someone that gave me room to pass on the high way  I want to thank them more than just flashing my warning lights twice.
468,Companies like AMD and Nvidia dont hire GPU designers  because theres no such thing. There hire architects (often CS majors)  RTL designers  verification engineers  LSI engineers  analog circuit designers  DFT engineers and so forth.  Whats important is to be very good at one of these jobs in general. There is no major difference between any of these jobs at AMD designing a CPU or GPU vs at Broadcom designing a modem chip.  The only exception might be if you have some kind of PhD in a very specific GPU related architecture research.
469,Complete BS is what I think.   Whatever mechanic said this probably fucked up  unbalanced the tires  was too lazy to fix it or didnt know how.   Then  they probably just used the too good tires saying to get your friend scared about her tires to make her pay for a tire change. Seems like either a Con or a scumbag to me OP
470,Completely idiotic driving like this is one of the main reasons why a speedlimit on the autobahn is wanted by the majority of the populatons by now.  350km/h while its crowded and going full boost and full brake between every single gap  srsly? Absolute moron
471,COMPRESSION.... because noone does scalers that are higher than 4k120hz... anything above is still doing SOME kind of compression. Even tho HDMI2.1 has bandwidth for uncompressed 4k200hz - noone has internal hardware for that yet.
472,Computer engineering or electrical engineering.  You'll want to learn VHDL or Verilog and know a lot about digital logic design (logic gates and other components).  Probably a good idea to build a strong background in the electricity and magnetism side of physics
473,Congrats OP. I was ridiculed when I got an outlander. Mine is a 2016 GT  the first year of that gen with a V6. I absolutely love it. Ive never had a problem with it. Only things Ive done are oil  brakes and tires. Things I wish it had: CarPlay (which I can add) and slightly better fuel economy.   This is absolutely a compact suv and only one that was available with a V6 and 3 rows at that time  maybe even now. I test drove all the mid-sized 3 rows: CX9  Sorento  Pilot  Highlander  Durango  etc. I wanted this precisely because its small (for city driving) and only wanted the 3rd row occasionally when family visited. 3rd row is perfect for small kids.   Things I like: Looks (to me)  SAWC  power folding heated side mirrors  compact 3 rows  power hatch  bulletproof engine  price  not too common.   I think people who hate this vehicle have never even driven it. Majority of user reviews is great. Yes  Mitsubishi other models suck but not the outlander.
474,Considering dev kits are out but drivers may not be optimal  I'd conservatively add 5-10% performance to many of these results. Mostly for the 1% lows since those often benefit from driver/optimization fixes.  Edit: looks like they wrote the same thing. Also  V Agency is a hilarious translation of Valve from Chinese but it makes sense.
475,Construct a base with several different items? Several? That sounds like a whole lot less than the forest  fragmented  don't starve etc. Which you're competing with.   My point is don't try to compete with them  narrow your niche   then narrow it some more and then once you think it's too narrow  narrow it once more.
476,"Consumer-ready -is $4000. What the actual fuck?!? I still don't understand why LG can't essentially cut up their smallest 4K TVs and turn them into decently priced 1080p 120hz monitors for us. Theoretically  it these could cost less than $400 for a 24"" and less than $450-500 for a 27"". Even the 32"" should cost less than $550-600. LG could price these even lower since the smaller size should mean a lower defect rate. I would strongly consider buying the 27"" even at $500. I bet they could even make 1440p monitors for not much more than these 1080p ones I am suggesting. These monitors are literal cut up TV displays that LG needs extremely small amount of R&D to make outside of the housing for the displays and maybe other very minor monitor electronics and software."
477,Contrary to the majority of people here I think is more about the fiction than mechanics. For me what will make a firearm feels realistic is its lethality. Like high and consistent damage and slow time to recover from it.  Pick something you are comfortable with and make some tweeks
478,Control was one of my favourite experiences from the last few years  not perfect but I enjoyed the hell out of it. The DLC is widely regarded as better than the main campaign  so hopefully Remedy learned some valuble lessons and can pump that into the sequel.
479,cool  any extra capacity in silicium is good  at that point. Plus it furthers education  Regarding the water  again they (tsmc) can recycle and filter pretty nicely. The sewers  unpotable water or even sea water should do the trick. They just need to be encouraged to build the waterplant needed alongside (and maybe emergency power backup). i think they have huge experience with water in taiwan (due to the drought  and limited fresh water on the isle).
480,Cool  I guess? Nostalgia for nostalgias sake is getting old. D2R was cool for about a week. Now  2 weeks after release  Friday night (when there is the most overall Twitch viewers)  and there are 3 people above 1k viewers for the game.   If they add some new content  great  I'm all for it. But if it is just a graphics update  and the exact same game from 15+ years ago....eh.
481,cool story bro  intel out here trying to get sales up without any 3rd party testing :SSSS     also kinda weird for the 2k threadripper being #2 showing this benchmark is a bit skewed as 3k threadripper is more efficient
482,"Correction  as usual this is monopolistic anti consumer action by locking part of the hardware they sell and making consumers pay a second time to unlock the rest of their cpu via a sold cdkey.  Remind me not to buy their shit and start porting to risc V because intel ""consumer grade"" is turning into utter shite"
483,Could be a balance issue which should be rechecked for free. If they can they should road force the tires as well. . Could be front end issue they should shake down the front end. Or an alignment issue. Idk either the guy doesn't know what he's talking about or he's covering up for something they fucked up. I would go somewhere else though. Get the car checked out and if it ends up being related to their work I would make them pay the bill. Usually I'd say give them a chance to look into it maybe it's unrelated or someone made a mistake but that line about the tires being too good means they are liars that shouldn't be trusted or they don't know what their doing and you don't want them touching your car.
484,Could be several things  it could be to lower the compression for boosted applications  could be to archive higher rpm  since the pistons travel slower in relation to the rpm  or to improve top end power  the few i can think
485,Coupes:  * F-Type * Mustang * R8 (1st Gen) * 350z * 911 * DB11  Sedans:  * Tesla Model S * A7/S7/RS7 (1st gen) * Rapide * Taycan * CLS 63  SUVs:  * New Bronco * New Defender * Rivian R1S * Navigator * Range Rover Full Size and Velar * G63 * Macan
486,"Cowboy Bebop was the first anime I watched 10 years ago! I really enjoyed it but it was more of a one-off thing for me and it didn't inspire me to continue watching more anime. Cowboy Bebop is amazing but it probably doesn't match up with your idea of what ""anime"" is  and I think that's a big reason why I watched it and moved on. Seven years after that I happened to watch Kill la Kill (which is about as ""anime"" as it gets) and that's what finally made me fall in love with anime. So I guess what I'm trying to say is that Bebop is a great show but I don't think it's all that representative of the current anime landscape. Definitely give it a watch but I recommend checking out some other anime on Netflix as well.   And since no one has mentioned this yet  if you like Cowboy Bebop you might also like Samurai Champloo. They're directed by the same guy and although they're very different on the surface  they have similar vibes."
487,"Crashes and other close-call mistakes happen most in the first session of the day  first session after lunch  and last session of the day.   In the morning   the track is cold and so are the drivers' reflexes.   After lunch  drivers are lethargic  and/or anxious to get out there if they spent part of the morning on repairs etc.   End of the day  drivers are tired and don't know when to call it a day. Don't try to ""get your money's worth"" going out every session if you're getting tired/losing concentration."
488,Creating a separate array with a filtered subset of the items sounds like a simple and straightforward solution  here. If you only have one array  think about all the different places in your code that youll need to do simple checks  like is this item hidden?  > When selecting an item to use  it will send a message to the original array to take action on the item.  This part has me just a little puzzled an array is just an array  arrays dont receive messages (unless youre talking about that in the Smalltalk / Objective C sense).  Youll have some method somewhere to perform actions on items  like equip  drop  etc.  > I am going to be making this network replicated in the future  if that would make one better than the other.  This seems like a pure UI system  it probably shouldnt be replicated at all. Youll want to replicate game state changes (is this item equipped?) but not UI state (which tab is the player looking at?)
489,CRPG tends to slap you in the face with text. A lot  a lot of text. If you're going to play a CRPG game  treat it as a book with images.   Burning out of RPG is not something completely new. I've experienced that  a lot. It's even worse for me cause I'm stuck with some OCD shit. I think the best method for this is choosing a game with completely no story to spend your time on. Like Noita or Dark Souls (yeah DS has story  but don't bother about it  just go read it online  it's easier that way). And when you miss RPG  come back. It's always there.
490,Crypto mining   Who would have thought that crypto would be the one to kill pc gaming. Unless AMD and Nvidia start moving to save their audience  the pc gaming market is going to suffer. They know that but I guess the money coming in from crypto is still more appealing. I hope both companies suffer the consequences.
491,Cure Whip from Kira Kira Precure A La Mode (worst entrance to the show in my opinion  but she's cute  sweet  and a bunny girl).   Also Cure Grace from Healin' Good Precure  but only in her movie-exclusive Partner Form that lasts for  like  a minute.
492,Current on session 38-39 or so right now. I'm the GM from Norway  I've got three players from Brazil  one from Mexico  one from Venezuela  and two on-and-off players from the US and Puerto Rico.  Most are NEETs  which helps a lot for playing consistently.
493,Currently doing my first run through all three mass effects. Just beat the 1st really excited to start two. The first was really awesome but just felt older because Ive been spoiled by newer rpgs. Excited to see the advances as I progress. I think Ill try the older fallouts after.
494,Currently I have absolutely no desire to watch anime even though I want to I just can't. I think the reason is because I went on a hilariously big binge earlier this year  and after I lost my ability to binge which was my first hint I kept pushing it to the point where I've barely watched anything for the last month or two. Is this just burn out that will go away in a few months?
495,Currently playing Nexomon One on my switch. I really enjoy the second one  but Im seeing just how much the second one does things better. Plus people werent kidding about the endgame level grind (I am about 3/4 of the way through the game). Its a bit annoying  but the game is fairly generous with experience when you need to grind and theres good rewards. Plus I like the cute story and the monsters  not to mention the pacing and story is more relaxed than the second. Im not sure about doing the post game though  considering the battles are super hard there. I may at least give it a try.  Ive also been trying to get into Xenoblade chronicles  but so far that hasnt been working out too well. I bought it and the sequel based on the hype  but now Im not sure its for me. Im not particularly fond of the story or the characters  the combat system is confusing to me  and Im constantly lost in the giant world and get frustrated. Im usually not into the Xenoblade/Xenosaga games (although I do enjoy watching other people play them) but I bought this one because of all the positive reviews and I thought it was something I would like. So far  Im not sure that was the right decision but Im only a few hours in. I might continue trying for a little bit longer  and if it doesnt work out I can sell it for a decent amount of money (according to pricecharting.com  at least).  The final game Ive been playing is fire emblem echoes on my 3DS. My 3DS is in very bad condition  but since my games are digital on top of that  I cant really sell it. So Ive just decided to continue playing until its unplayable  and then probably donate it for parts. Its holding up  but just barely. So Fire Emblem Echoes may very well be the last game I can play on there. Its an OK game  and I appreciate the novelty but its definitely not my favorite of the series. Its the only fire emblem game Ive got since I sold and finished three houses (although I do have other strategy games) and finished or at least did a fair amount with everything else. So Im willing to put up with the problems just to get in my last fire emblem game before Ive done everything I can with the series until the next installment.
496,"Custom made printed and laminated 2D terrain on both card stock and overhead projector transparencies.  I did 3 dimensional terrain and miniatures for a little over a decade for both wargames and RPGs.  After years and years and years of schlepping stuff around from place to place  and buying my first house which was going to have a dedicated game room in it  I decided that I didn't want to have that room be buried under a metric ton of slowly rotting cardboard and foam.  2D terrain costs a fraction of a fraction of what 3D terrain costs and can be generated in a fraction of the time it takes to make and paint terrain.  It stores BEAUTIFULLY.  You can drag around two or three campaign's worth of terrain with you in a backpack.  That being said  when I did 3D terrain  it was almost entirely handmade foam  foam core  paper  cardstock  card board  and popsicle sticks.  Scifi terrain tended to be more ""whatever weird crap I could find.""  Food containers  old pieces of machinery  random crap I found while dumpster diving behind CMU.  All of my kit and toy bashing was mostly used for the scifi stuff as well  but that was probably only because there wasn't anywhere near as much fantasy stuff to scavenge from in the 80s and 90s.  If I were doing it still today  I'd still go almost entirely the handmade route.  I might steal a piece here and there to incorporate into my own pieces  but overall I want the control of customization  and I really just *enjoyed* doing it.  I'd also probably do a lot more sculpting and casting than I used to do.  It was stuff I knew how to do way back when  but the cost was prohibitive to the starving college student version of me."
497,Cut the size of the campaigns.  Make it so that games run for a few weeks. Maybe a single narrative thread over a single month. Then  at the end of each month  the groups shift their members around for new short short adventures.
498,"Cyberpunk 2020 or GURPS  hands down. For fantasy stuff Mythras or HarnMaster  GURPS will also work and I've heard very good things about The Riddle of Steel. If rules light is the priority over ""realism""  I'd suggest a Cepheus Engine variant  maybe something like Zozer's Modern War or Cepheus Modern."
499,D&D has name recognition  organized play support (ish)  freely avaialble basic rules  works well for open-ended play  and has  good online tools. It also has a huge legacy of former players who have gotten back into the hobby.   Plus  it's kind of a self-fulfilling prophecy.  DMs need players  and it's easier to get players for D&D than some obscure indie game (no matter how good it is).  There probably tons of established groups playing other things but you don't know about them because they aren't looking for players.  Just in the past decade we've done One Ring  7th Sea  FFG Star Wars  Feng Shui  Song of Ice and Fire  and Scum & Villainy  in addition to D&D  plus numerous one-shots or short arcs in various systems.  Getting a good group together is the hard part. Getting a group that are used to playing together to try something new is relatively easy. If you suck it up and play D&D for a bit and get a good group of people together  you can probably talk into at least trying something different.
500,"D&D inspired me to move away from D&D. ;D  D&D just does D&D which is D&D which is fine but...it's just D&D.   Been kinda bored with the D&D-as-system for over 30 years now.   &#x200B;  D&D doesn't really support the games or playstyles I'm interested in (ie  literally everything that isn't D&D) and doesn't follow design choices I like or am super interested in. Classes and levels and races and things like that. Exception based design. Continual recycling of tired elements (Fireball!). ""Vancian"" casting. Non-point based. Non-universal. Alignments. ""Epic Fantasy"". Basically everything about D&D 5e and it's associated culture is pretty meh to me.  A lot of ""modern"" D&D (5e) seems based around canned adventures and just (personal OPINION!) the worst kind of ""D&D"" stuff (The Bard rolls to seduce lolllerz!!!) that  yah  it was boring in middle school  it was boring in high school...it's still all these years later the same. Things I actively don't like in games I play in.  The only real reasons I could see to play D&D would be short term nostalgia games or because there's nothing else available."
501,"D&D is fine  but it's limiting.  You are stuck with fantasy resoruce managment.  While that's what a lot of people want  it dosen't fill every niche.  We see what happens when people try and do modern games  or sci-fi with D&D  and it never ends well.  In short - it tells one sort of story.  While it tells that story really well - it's still just one story.  The fact that D&D couldn't accurately tell a ""lord of the rings"" story  while still being based on LotR  should tell you that pretty clearly.  What's more  combat takes far longer than it should.  Sure  it's better than 3rd and 4th edition  but it's still a bit of a slog.  Class-based character creation is innately limiting.  You end up thinking ""I'm gonna make a great fighter!"" instead of ""I'm going to make a great character.""  Class/Race comes first  and ideas come later.  The Hit Point system is frustrating.  I know it's unrealistic  but it lends itself to some gameplay situations that just don't make any sense.  Example: Two city guards are trying to escape an alley  but the thieves' guild has an army of thugs with crossbows armed the moment they leave the alley.  The level 2 guard knows he has to give up because he'll die if he tries to run.  The level 10 guard can likely run though the hail of arrows because he knows he has enough HP to survive more hits than they can likely land.  That doesn't make sense.    I prefer a good generic system. My favorite at the moment is Savage Worlds.  I can use it to tell pretty much any story I want in any setting with minimal tweaking.  When I do want to tell something special  it just takes a little writing (I'm working on Savage Dresden Files right now).  Combat goes quick  and is cinematic.  What's more  it's FUN.  Once you learn a good generic system  you can use it to run just about anything and really branch out in telling stories you might have never told before."
502,D&D is really only good at being D&D and it's always been that way. After running various versions for years I finally realized that it  was never going to work for the games I like to run and so I moved on.
503,Damn  [the Doldia Village](https://i.imgur.com/W7ZEMQP.png) sure looked nice.  Geese sure is a fun character. I like the fact that even though he is not a fighter he helped Rudeus to fight those traffickers.   Damn so [Gallus Cleaner](https://imgur.com/a/lVdou2t) just used them as a decoy. So was the group he sent them to a rival to his?   [I love how the dog stopped when he was right behind Rudeus.](https://i.imgur.com/0uKljrt.png)   Well  I'm glad that [Rudeus got reunited with Eris and Ruijerd so soon.](https://i.imgur.com/3ObrOPF.png)  [Lol  the apology pose of the beast race is so funny.](https://i.imgur.com/jlcDLMQ.png)   [Damn that white-haired elf has some crazy-looking shades.](https://i.imgur.com/wIoREHX.png)   Wow  I sure did not expect to see [Saurus](https://imgur.com/a/f7Hlwdw) getting executed.
504,"Damn  Eugene. Setting up all the flags made his death not too surprising but still impactful. Well done on that aspect.  Also  I  hate to ask this but what is [this scene](https://i.imgur.com/5wtmjhr.png) showing? I guess it's what's  *ehem*  ""left"" of Eugene but I'm not entirely sure."
505,damn that really sucks... im still dowloading it and will play it since i have my son getting good at multiplaying and he has his uncle/my brother in law playing as team together... but there are times where i just want to play solo... i guess this game wont be one of them...
506,Damn the OP and ED are both certified bangers. Having watched Mugen Train in cinemas  rewatching it on my tablet will be a whole new experience I'm looking forwards to.  Once again highlighting Rengoku's positivity and energy. His character was definitely the highlight of the Mugen Train arc  it's so positive that you can feel it streaming out of the screen. Always have a smile on my face when he is on screen!
507,Damn the show is cute         Also with how huge and ripped her Grandpa is I really wonder where her short genes come from       Really love the senpai-kohei ship  but the side coworker ship already is preparing to leave port!        Btw  is there any info on when the OST releases? I need that OP  its too damn good
508,Dark Souls maybe. It doesn't have a deep skill tree  but the are a couple of builds to go for. You basically have 7-10 base stats to level up like strength  dexterity and intelligence. What you choose to focus on determine what gear or weapon you can use and how you approach fights.
509,"Darkest Dungeon is one that I discovered recently. I love it for the turn based combat and the variety and ingenuity of the different classes of characters. There aren't choices that effect the story  but it's one of those difficult games that can and will punish you for mistakes you make in your battles with the stress and permadeath mechanics. I like it so far (haven't beaten it yet  but it's not for everyone.   The other ones I've liked recently are Star Wars: Knights of the Old Republic and its sequel Knights of the Old Republic 2: the Sith Lords. I prefer Kotor 2 more than the first  but there's a reason they are remaking the first game. You can play the entirety of these games as a blaster-wielding Force Lightning Sith  or get yourself a Darth Maul-esque dual Lightsaber and run around your with droid posse. Some choices in the game feel obviously Light Side or Dark Side  but especially in Kotor 2 your Light Side or ""Good"" actions lead your companions to turn down a dark side path  or actually lead to the misfortune of others when it wasn't intended. At the point I'm at  it has played with a lot of cool philosophical ideas.   If you hate anything Star Wars  then maybe not for you  but it's removed enough from the movies and other Star Wars media that I think it's approachable for people who haven't seen the movies.   Each of these games I believe are about $10-$15 on Steam."
510,Dealerships arent dumb. They are aware of common issues with makes and models and know they will be reimbursed for it. The fun begins where you have a major claim on an issue that rarely or never happens to a car  like a blown transmission or a blown motor on an otherwise solid car. Dealerships dont mind doing warranty work  but if they feel that they wont get reimbursed for it  they will investigate and for serious claims (10k or more) they will sometimes fly an engineer out to look for themselves.
511,Deathloop had great reviews  and even if its sales are only good and not amazing games that get great reviews and don't have quite the marketing or aesthetic push to be huge hits are exactly the sort of games that inspire other studios. I wouldn't call Deathloop a tragedy  a failure  *or* have anything at all to do with AAA practices.  I also don't understand what Sharkmob's battle royale has to do with Arkane. Their Redfall game - which is in development  not yet out - is in the Left 4 Dead type of genre  not battle royale.  In short  I don't understand where you're coming from or why you're saying it. This isn't really a good place for unfounded rants.
512,Decisions like these are putting me further and further away from the Switch  cloud versions of games that are literally from GENERATIONS ago? If it was maybe just KH3 I could see  but this is embarrassing.
513,deffo agree with the peeps here that it's a mental health issue  i've struggled myself with compulsive thought stuff like this before  on the bright side at least when you're over the hump you'll have a metric ton of notes you can peruse to either run games or make fate/pbta or something hacks with
514,Define good. What are you hoping to use it for? Gaming/ Video editting/ just web browsing?   Also what is important to you  will you be travelling with it so is size important? Do you know what size screen you want? If you care about those things at all go to your local PC world  pick up a few laptops  see how heavy and large is right for you  that with what you're looking to do will inform what laptop is right for you
515,Definitely code geass and soul eater thought it was the pinnacle of anime when I watched when I was 10 years old now 7 years later I find code geass was pretty medicore to bad and soul eater was just a 5/10 or 4/10  Anohana might be a contender also my opinion has changed a alot about it
516,Definitely gonna be an EGS exclusive on PC if [this bit of news](https://investors.remedygames.com/announcements/remedy-entertainment-signs-with-epic-games-to-publish-two-new-multi-platform-games/) is any indication.
517,Definitely look into seeing a psychologist  because if this keeps happening and you don't feel able to not do the thing  that starts reading as an executive dysfunction. Therapy can definitely help with that.
518,Definitely not RPGs but Stardew Valley and Civ V on low difficulty are really good for this. I guess for an RPG  Id go with an MMO  though I cant give specific recommendations since I dont really like MMOs.
519,Definitely SMT/Persona but probably more Persona considring they are literally set in modern day Japan and you spend a good chunk of the games just hanging around the city/country with your friends. The fantasy elements come in to play when you travel with those friends to an alternate reality. The games generally tend to have this amazing balance of Alt reality dungeon crawling and real world social simulation. SMT can fit here as well but it's Tokyo is more post apocalyptic and has less moments of genuine realism
520,Definitely wasn't expecting Igarashi to have called her Grandfather with that build he had and of course he's voiced by Ootsuka Akio the cast in this series is just stellar!  Takeda is legit a Senpai and a human being I strive to be in a work place  not caring about what others think and always thinking whats best for others even if it might cost them.
521,Definitely! I'm a programmer whose learning blender for cute low poly assets. It just takes so long to do anything  but I can sculpt better than I can draw so 3d low poly feels like my only option    Really  I want passable game assets that work for the mechanics of games I code up and are quick to produce.   I honestly think its just practise. I've had decades to get better at coding  but only a few months with blender. All things with time  eh?  What about you?
522,Delivery fee is likely $1 7XX Autonomous Driving Fee is likely $10 000 Per vehicle 'subscription' (likely the Membership) is expected to be $5 500 over 10 years.  Reading that there will be a yearly fee for autonomous driving makes me not want to buy this car.
523,Dell tried to spin and blame  rather than admit they forked up and can't keep up with modern idle power requirements.  Nobody should be buying Alienware anyway. It's overpriced  underengineered crap that is targeted at consumers who sadly don't know any better and end up with a hunk of mostly plastic.
524,Demon Slayer. Those first few episodes are a goddamn masterpiece. Gorgeous to look at  tragic  but inspiring and tell the story on their own. Showing that Tanjiro can rise from a horrible tragedy to better himself and strive for improvement  all while taking great sacrifices trying to preserve what little family he has left.  After that it's just a very beautiful looking generic as hell story. Visuals are great  yes  but all of this has been done before many times over. I was really disappointed when it shifted from showing this dramatic story focused on the weak characters in a world with constant fighting to a story about the ones who actually do participate in the fighting and welcome it.
525,Demonicon! When budgets gets low - it goes VERY low  but the game is pretty fun! The Dark Eye setting  interesting moral choices  very questionable yet fascinating main storyline. The very definition of a B-class rpg  janky  charming and memorable.
526,Depends on the challenge you want  and the type. Want a horde? Give them nearly none  but pile a ton on. Want a threat? Slightly below party average. Want a danger? Slightly above party average. Want a boss? Minimum of double the party average. That goes up by a multiple depending on the level of boss you want.
527,Depends on the game  for something like darksouls which is designed loosely around new game + in which it gets quicker and quicker and forms part of the experience and fits in with the narrative it makes sense. For everything else I find Ng+ a trend that rarely provides anything good and just makes you trudge through the same shit again at almost the same pace. I quite liked the approach of Dragon Quest XI to end game content where you get a kinda trick ending and thens there is heeps more to play.
528,Depends on the game. If there's a heavy protagonist that's always in my party  they're gonna get all the stat boosts that go to their play style (attack and def or magic). The others will get whatever works best on them.
529,Depends on the NG+ and the game. For example in SMT series or SaGa series  NG+ is about seeing the other dialog options or playing the other half of the game without having to grind again. If it's just the same game again  I don't really bother.  OTOH  I'm not a big fan of games where the post game content is a lot of the game.
530,Depends on the scope of your game  but have you considered just packaging it up and selling it as a tradional desktop or mobile game? I know this isn't your question but it is another option with its own set of pros and cons.
531,"Depends on the world.  Some existing fictional universes are enormous with tons of cool things to see and do in an RPG set there.  Star Wars for example.  Others are much smaller and are kind of ""one trick ponies"" that feel like they might be fun for a couple short adventures in but don't really have enough range for anything longer.  Alien and Blade Runner seem like good examples of this type."
532,Depends on what your goals are. Me  I'm developing a 2D platformer with RPG elements  comparable to any metrovanian.  If you want to work on an mmorpg in a big firm like blizzard  no chance. If you want to work for yourself or in a small indie game company on small projects you have good chances.
533,Depends on your likes  but if you want a solid and very enjoyable fantasy RPG? Pillars of Eternity.   Want the same mechanics with a different setting  and fuck it  throw in pirates? Pillars of Eternity 2: Deadfire.   Story and exploration with fun build styles? Disco Elysium.   Exploration with interesting builds and party mechanics? Pathfinder: Kingmaker.  Theres loads more but those are the ones I will always suggest.
534,Depends really. Too easy and it's boring. Too hard and it's too frustrating. It depends on other mechanics that go with it. If your having to dodge or block would mean a lower health. You'd have to play around and find what works as a balance.
535,Depends what he wants to do: is he aware it is a hallucination or not? Does he want the others to notice something is wrong fairly quickly  or only slowly/not at all? How is the entity interacting with him? Actively hostile? Friendly? Does it play psychological games?   He could be seen talking to nothing in the evenings during his watch  or he might start acting very shifty  looking off to the side to something only he can see. He might become adamant about not eating fungi  or develop bizarre ritualistic beliefs meant to protect him from the mushroom entity. He might begin to act similar to someone having a psychosis  so I suggest you research that.
536,Depends what you're after!    At that age  the 9 year-old is almost ready for actual *D&D*.  The 7 year-old not so much!  If you want the *D&D* experience  but for kids  I recommend *Hero Kids* (but I would 'cos I wrote it):    https://www.drivethrurpg.com/product/106605/Hero-Kids--Fantasy-RPG?src=hottest\_filtered        If you want more of a fairies and horses experience  then check out *No Thank You  Evil* or *Heroes of Equestria*.
537,Depends. Are you a CEO of a company of 100 people or a solo indie dev? The answer would depend a lot on your situation.  Personally  as a full time indie dev (me + a bunch of long term contractors) I use one account which is primarily a brand but with some personal stuff (still game dev related). Overall  I do not sweat over it too much since Twitter is not very useful for promotion anyway and is more like a tool to connect with other people (mostly press and other devs with a few fans).  Again  if I would run a bigger operation my answer would be quite likely different.
538,"Depening on how hard you idea is to implement (in general or for you personally) I'd suggest doing either a prototype of the smallest possible version  testing the gameplay loop with a selfmade tabletop version or ""simulating"" a session on paper. While those are not 100% proof it will work it's very useful to find flaws early that didn't come to mind when you first theorized your idea."
539,Despite my username  I haven't been super into Skylines since high school. Too expensive and heavy for what I'd want out of a sports car. Although the I6 exhaust is something I absolutely love  so I guess I'll have to find a way to get a BMW Z4 for cheap. Maybe find one that needs a water pump.
540,Destroking reduces the distance a piston travels which makes it easier to make it rev higher. Best for high rpm race car builds. For example  Formula 1 cars use engines that are only 1.6 liters but make 700+hp.
541,"Deus Ex series(First too)   Arcanum   Arx Fatalis   Gothic 1 2   Vampire: The Masquerade  Bloodlines   Risen   Elex   ""Persona"" and ""Shin Megami Tensei"" series(Yeah I know that ""Persona"" is a spin-off of ""SMT"")   Planescape:Torment   Icewind Dale(It is classic RPG but honestly I didn't like it)   ""Final Fantasy"" series   Chrono Trigger   Wizardry 8   Ultima Underworld(why not))   System Shock(However I didn't play it yet)   Neverwinter Nights   Divinity   Xenogears   Anachronox   Dungeon Siege(I liked 3 1 and 2 are meh)   Note that I didn't play some games in this list"
542,Develop your concept  create visualizations of how the final product you're envisioning will look and work towards creating the minimal viable product of that vision. Scattershot development might work for some  but it's likely to end up in abandoned projects. Concept first  strong vision  prototype  evaluate  iterate.  If you have good art skills you could create a mockup of the gameplay  a mockup screenshot. Or you could write a document detailing features  rules and create a scenario of the game flow. And you can also just use open source assets to compose your mockups as well.  You need to create a guide for yourself that can motivate you and keep you focused.
543,Diablo 2 wasn't even a good game by today's standards.  Resurrected on console is lukewarm bird shite concealing on a 480 monitor  compared to D2.  D3 is a step back in almost every way  barring the actually fun feel of the gameplay.  D3 is even better on console  eliminating all of the negative DRM nonsense  and feels incredibly kinesthetically pleasing and impactful to play on a console gamepad controller.  D4 is going to be an MMO.  It's going to be tepid dogshit straight out of the gate.  The best game in the series is still D1.  And it is barely a retro phone game anymore.
544,Did anyone else feel like some of the camera angles they picked during the dinner conversation were a bit weird?  Otherwise great setup episode - Excited to see the combo moves with Hyuse that Kuga mentioned.
545,Did he install the nuts under the motherboard to keep it from touching the tower? I forgot what theyre called  but if you dont install them and the tower doesnt come with them  you will short out the board. I think theyre called push offs or something to that degree.
546,Did you mean 2021?  If you did mean 2022  the shows I'm looking forward to the most  are:  1. My Dress-Up Darling 2. Soredemo Ayumu wa Yosetekuru 3. Aharen-san 4. Shikimori-san 5. Chainsawman (Usually not my type of show  but I'll check it out  some things I heard about it were interesting).  That's for the new shows  and for the sequels:  1. Kaguya S3 2. Tanya the evil S2 3. Takagi-san S3 4. Rikekoi S2 5. Kyouko Suiri S2 6. Uzaki-chan S2
547,Didnt care until I got a car for college. My parents bought me a 2014 Honda Civic sedan. It had a CVT. No  it was not particularly fun to drive. But overall? I realized its just fun to drive no matter what. I went down the rabbit hole on car maintenance  care  detailing  and so on. It just clicked.  Fast forward today  I drive a manual and just love hooning my car  even if it isnt anything special. Its just fun nailing downshifts. Its just fun to *drive*. Its irrational  just like love in general. (The short of it being Im now at a point where I probably care too much for my car  haha.)
548,Didn't realize how collectible my car (07 STI Ltd.) was until I saw the 221/800 plaque on the center console. It's also just one of the more desirable years for the old STIs. Now it's worth more than I bought it for 2 years ago!
549,Different publishers do different size print runs from year to year. Almost all shipping is delayed right now so who knows when restocking is going to happen. A lot of publishers do have print on demand options on drivethrurpg and a few have them on lulu.  One important thing to keep in mind is licenses end. So  if you are looking at something like the Alien RPG from Free League or the Expanse RPG from Green Ronin  or anything based on a book  movie  etc. dont delay. You never know what the terms are of the deal the publisher made.  RPGs like the Firefly  Supernatural  and Smallville  RPGs from Margaret Weis Productions  the Star Wars RPG from Wizards of the Coast  the Conan RPG from Mongoose  the Lone Wolf RPG from Cubicle 7 all gone.
550,Digimon Story: Cyber Sleuth and it sequel are very well made RPGs in my opinion. Turn based. And kid friendly (Digimon is a childrens IP after all). Worth checking out and probably dairy cheap on PS4.
551,"Disclaimer  I am not a laywer.  First of all  you should check what licenses the book provides. There's a possibilty that the author has allowed for fan content  in which case a lot of this head ache will go away. That is how the PbtA and OSR books get on; part of their idea is to let others work with and adapt the system by offering permissive licenses.  Otherwise  in general under most Western IP law  game mechanics do not enjoy copyright with regards to how they work  but rather to how they are expressed. A game like D&D does not have a claim on all the systems that use a number to keep track of how close your character is to fainting  nor does it have exclusive rights to call that number ""Hit Points"". However  it does have a claim to the expression of the mechanic  in terms of the prose and sentence structure in the PHB. So write your own book  even if the contents are the same. Changing a few things helps your position as well. I'd say that the setting is more fraught with issues than the mechanics  but since you're doing your own thing with that  it should be okay."
552,Disconnect all usb devices. Disconnect all hdd  ssd and dvdroms. Disconnect anything besides the power cable and the screen cable. Take the gpu out if your cpu has a integrated gpu. Connect to motherboard video output. Try one ram stick at a time. Try a different power supply.
553,Disgaea 5. It has a story that you can follow  but you can also just skip it. I find the story to not be very interesting compared to previous entries  but if you like strategy RPGs  it's one of the best gameplay wise.     I pretty much always find myself grinding characters and item levels while listening to a podcast when I'm bored
554,Diving back into **Wasteland 3** to play the final DLC that dropped yesterday  Cult of the Holy Detonation. Playing some **Diablo II: Resurrected** on the side as mindless filler when I need a change of pace.
555,Divinity Original Sin 1&2 and PF: Kingmaker / WoTR should be on your list! Those four games can keep you busy for 1000 hours and have very high replayability.   Solasta is okay too but the production quality lacks imo.  Edit: not sure if your PC could run the first block i suggested - they can be pretty demanding but check GFN.
556,Divinity Original Sin 1+2  Wasteland 2+3 (1 is pretty dated these days)  Encased  Shadowrun: returns  hong kong and dragonfall  Battletech  Pillars of Eternity 1+2  Disco Elysium  If any of those seem to interest you you can find a bunch more related.  It seems ya mostly play jrpg's tho   Chrono Trigger  Tales of(any) *not really turn based but very  manageable party and super dope  Really can't go wrong with any Final Fantasy 12 and down  Octopath Traveler    That should help ha ha
557,Divinity: Original Sin 1 and 2 are great for this. Not only is there freedom in how you build  the world affords a high level of interactivity.  As an example  in Divinity: Original Sin 1  there's a very tough boss near the end of the first act. If you engage them directly  there's a chance that you'll win  but you're likely going to have a rough time.  If you take a smarter approach  it becomes substantially easier. The room is packed with explosives  so if you have a stealthy or invisible character  you could rearrange all of those explosives out of combat to be near your enemies  and then blow them up once combat starts. Or you could  just use the Teleport skill to drop the explosives onto your enemies.  Alternatively  there's also a large turret nearby that does incredible damage. It's tough  but if you manage to sneak past and activate it before the boss initiates  the turret will be on your side and blast your enemies to cinders.  Both games also allow for roundabout ways to complete most quests  as well as sequence break to skip portions of quests. There's a lot of freedom in those games and they're both worth checking out.
558,Do I drive them? Yes  they are meant to be driven. Do I mod them? No  I could mod any other car  the beauty about driving a classic is being able to get into a time capsule and enjoy it. Ive got Ferraris that are slower than modern mini vans. Thats not the point of it.
559,Do something else for the last 2-4 hours of the day. Something completely different. Gym  prose books  go fishing or take a bike ride or whatever. Get all that exciting technical stuff out by concentrating on something else.  I don't also know how many hours 'quite a bit of the day' is but try to limit your hours to a work day. Productivity starts to fall after 4-6 hours anyway  after that you're making mistakes and your judgement gets clouded.
560,Do the absolute smallest game you think is almost viable. Cut every corner you can get away with. Do this until you have a shippable build. If it feels too weak and you have energy/time/money  then you add value to it. I promise that itll still be a lot of work.
561,Do they think that they won't make new account and buy the game there instead of their main account. It's not like accounts are registered to an actual person with some biometric system. I wish they were so cheaters would get permanent bans.
562,Do you feel the same knowing this is only complete game ive done?  https://store.steampowered.com/app/1726850/Droopy_Balls_Simulator_2021/  But in all seriousness  I am a 2d animator by trade  like most of us here life long passion for games so I picked it up. It is INSANE how hard it is  the barrier to entry is through the roof. Not only do you need to learn a programming language  you need art  engine knowledge. From what I learned there really isnt short cuts either  because I will take everyone I see.   Best of luck on your journey.
563,Do you have a USB drive plugged into the same set of ports as your mouse dongle? I frequently run into machines whose wireless mouse stops working as soon as I plug in a thumb drive in the port next to the dongle. Mouse starts working immediately after I remove the thumb drive.
564,do you have gameplay preferences? Disco Elysium is definitely urban but doesn't have any action game elements really. Or like the new spiderman games are great and take place in a pretty realistic Manhattan
565,"Do you know that ""x"" is better than your trash ""x"" series  right?   Fuck these people  you don't like/watch this good old anime about delinquents  but love the newer one? Fuck you  that series isn't good cuz I say it  watch mine cuz its old.   Nowadays I cant say i like bnha or demons slayer cuz aparently they are new and olds will always be better"
566,Do you need to switch to more story-oriented games like Mass Effect? With ME the combat is just ok and the weapons can only be tinkered with a little bit  but there is a strong story with a beginning  middle and end that is wrapped up in a bow in a traditional three-act arc.   And I don't care how cheesy it is  the end boss of Mass Effect 2 is \*chef's kiss\*
567,Do you spend time developing a game? Then you are a game developer.  Everything else people might mention here just qualifies whether or not you are a *successful* game developer. And the only measure of success which matters to you is your own.
568,"Do you want them to roll dice?  I'm playing ""kids on bikes"" with my friends and really enjoying it. There are some basic conflict rules but I'm avoiding conflict... mostly having my players encounter stoned teens in a graveyard  a cave full of bats and pirate treasure  a sinister ice cream man and a ghost of a fellow classmate.   I like that you roll dice for actions but you are almost expected to fail  at which point you gain a token and those tokens mean you can succeed when it matters. I make them roll often so they get lots of tokens and their failures are minor like ""you fall on your ass"" or ""you get flustered while talking"".   Now we are all adults so it is very much a pg13 1980's movie feel but you could very easily use any tone."
569,Dodge Rolling is a **Dagger Core Skill**  so you can only do it while wielding Daggers after you have bought it. Fighters  Assassins and Mystic Knights have a shield the can block with. And Mage/Sorcerers shouldn't be that close to the combat.  To sprint  push down the left analogue stick **L3**  Sprinting speed is affected by your carry weight (and choice of torso during character creation)  To grab hold of an enemy  you hit the bottom right shoulder button **R2**. How long you can hold on is affected by stamina and your augments.  And if you are playing Warrior  climbing and dodging are not the best options. Try switching to a Dagger class. **Strider** is _very_ good at both.
570,Does anyone currently do lan or tcp/ip regularly for any games? Whats the big deal of just making a private lobby? Seems like we took valid blizzard issues and are focusing on being outraged on minuscule non issues.
571,Does anyone have a harder time finding new players when you are a touch older? I'm 49 and I find it very hard to find gamers to bolster our dwindling group of gamers. I walk into a gaming store and while there are occasionally older characters the vast majority are in the younger age groups and I often get these weird glances.  The other problem is I'm not a fan of the newer versions of the games and everybody is always obsessed with playing the latest version.. Hell I still have my original purple box D&D from the 70s.  I love going to Gencon since there is a huge cross section of gamers of every age.
572,Does anyone know of podcasts that feature extremely skilled players? Ones that make interesting and creative choices on a fairly regular basis?  Like instead of just automatically fighting monsters they pursue other possibilities or when they do fight  they do so very creatively and strategically?  Thank you.
573,Does anyone know some good European (or EU) stores/shops that sell car modification parts and sell the parts online (for BMW in particular)?  When I open any page related to car modifications it seems to be in the USA.
574,Does anyone remember Death Country Text Based Game? I remember playing it back in (approximation) 2007 and I believe it was still going in 2009  when I stopped playing it. I do not know if it is even a thing but one of my friends brought it up and it has made me very curious. Hopefully someone else out there remembers it and can recommend a game similar to help relive the good old simple days. Only difference is I will not have to change the proxy to the school desktop everytime I wanna play it.
575,"Does he not realize that DLSS Ultra Performance runs at 33% resolution? He keeps comparing it to FSR Performance as if they are competing settings.   But that means he is comparing 720p to 480p and going ""Oh man  these are close but I gotta give it to the 720p"".  Well no shit sherlock.  If he wants to play around with Ultra-Performance  he should at least be doing it at 4K  running Ultra-Performance at 1440p is not recommended by anyone  including Nvidia."
576,Does this ever happen to you? Your a diehard Honda/Toyota/Nissan fan. Love every aspect of it but at the same time you been following the big 3 of America. GM  Ford  FCA (Stellantis or going old school Chrysler) of ever make  model  generation of everything for the longest time as well.
577,Does this proposed law require the device to charge with Type-C? If not  then Apple can easily get around this by removing all ports from iPhones and AirPods and making them charge exclusively wirelessly through MagSafe.
578,Doesn't bother me at all. As far as I'm concerned more IPs should have TTRPGs tied to them to draw people into the hobby and give more love to non-d20 systems.  Besides  having an RPG based on an IP isn't too different from having an RPG with a predefined setting and people don't seem to have an issue with these.
579,Doesn't seem like anyone's mentioned it but I'd snag Torment: Tides of Numenara. I built my character to ONLY resolve issues via conversation for my first playthrough  and barring one fight (I think I only had 6 in the whole game) we did great and I felt like the game rewarded me for playing my character - a smooth-tongued rogue.   Give it a try  it's really cheap on Xbox.
580,Doing another playthrough of **Arcanum: Of Steamworks and Magick Obscura** since it's been a few years  but this time I'm using Drog Black Tooth's famous Unofficial Arcanum Patch to fix a bit of the jank.   Going non-combat pure Charisma/Persuasion/Summoner this time around and I want to see if it's possible to talk your way through the game while letting everyone else do the heavy lifting for you.
581,Dont agree with any of that. One  I always put on my seatbelt so Ive never heard my car chime at me. Two  Ive never lost a key before so Ive never had to buy a replacement  but even I did  I still much prefer newer FOBs. Every time I have to go back to a key  it sucks. I love never having to take me key out of my pocket. I walk up to my car and the car door will let me open it even though my key is still in my pocket  I get in and start car  with key still in my pocket. I get out  park  walk away  and tada  I hear it lock on its own as Im walking away  again  key still in my pocket.
582,don't be discouraged when working on your car goes haywire. This happened to me my first couple of jobs and i gave up on wrenching all together. Now i'm older and don't really care (if i mess it up i'll just pay to tow it to a shop  not really an option when i was younger). You will eventually figure it out.
583,Don't care for Final Fantasy series myself  games mostly just share the name and some chocobos here and there  oh and the victory fanfare.  My favorite series is the Trails one  where different series have their own protagonists and characters  each happening in a different realm in the same universe but it's all interconnected  with some characters doing crossovers  also the enemies are different in each series  but there are underground organizations pulling strings common in all the series. Not only that  I also love that even the town NPCs are deeper than the one-liners you get in most RPGs  here each has his/her own substory  that you can totally ignore if you want  but if you take the time to read them  you'll actually look forward to talk to each of them in the next chapter to see what happened.
584,Don't go for best time possible straightaway. Take is easy  learn the track  learn the physical limits of your car. Take a rest once in a while and stay hydrated.  Use your cooldown lap to actually cool down (if such a thing exists in your case)  especially the brakes  not take one more go for a better lap time. You don't want to return to a full stop in the pit lane boiling up.  Check tyre pressure between sessions  most likely it will go up significantly and you will need to reduce it. Excessive pressure = increased temperature  increased tyre wear (up to killing a set of tyres in one track day) and reduced grip. Don't forget to set it back to normal afterwards when driving home.  Learn track etiquette (ask before the race if you haven't been introduced)  overtaking rules etc etc. I believe someone should instruct all drivers before start of the track day.  P.S. Remove everything from your interior and trunk that's not tied down properly before you race. If it can be flying around  it WILL BE flying around hard.
585,Dont have it and havnt played it yet but nights black agents is a gumshoe system rpg about ex-spys  vampires  and conspiracies made by Kenneth hite who also worked on vampire the masquerade. I will say that gumshoe is very focused on mystery and investigation so if that's your thing I have really enjoyed other gumshoe games (trail of cthulhu- a gumshoe adaption of coc).
586,Don't just randomly code stuff and stop whenever. Mind will have open ended code brain.  Plan 4 hours or whatever time you have. Code on a piece that takes that amount of time  and stop  consider your day done.  Then go work out. I run 5 miles after coding  I always sleep.  Code brain activity is way different from sleep. You need to transition.
587,Don't know about the others  but in Underraill  it's not that the combat is not very deep (beacuse it is)  it's just that at some point your build is well established and has some specific  optimal way to fight. If you want variety  you need to look for it on your own  there is a lot of utility and crafting in the game that could can be used for combat.     A general advice I would give is either allow yourself to take a break or play a couple of games at once  in different genres  that helps in keeping things fresh.
588,Don't know if it's really that rare or that collectable. I've never seen another one of them so you decided. But 96 spider 916 was my university project. We don't really drive it anymore my mom can't drive it. My dad and I prefer to drive our motorcycles and in winter or when I need a car I'm not taking out a 2 seater softtop convertible. It drives maybe 200 miles a year.
589,Dont let the automated combat put you off of FF XII. Its pretty great. Imagine if you could automate all the routine  obvious decisions in your typical JRPG (e.g. attack the weakest enemy  heal the guy with low HP  use the element the enemy is weak against) and manually intervene whenever you want/need.  Plus I found it really fun and engaging trying to program my team to my exact specifications. That was more interesting than the actual battle system in most JRPGs IMO
590,Don't let them craft if they do not have storage available?  Like  I feel there is information missing to this question.  Ignore the procs for a moment.  *What happens when an employee crafts an item and storage is full?*
591,"Don't listen to anything Scotty kilmer posts on YT dude is a hack and a wack job.   And 120k on coolant and brakes? That seems excessively high imo. Most vehicles say around 30k for brakes. And I think like 30k for coolant on most vehicles.   It's usually like every 2 years you should get them both done. 120k seems unreal.   Just because it tests good doesn't mean don't flush it. Those test strips are a very basic form of testing especially the coolant one. They just measure the acidity of the coolant. It doesn't test the break down or the coolant/water ratio (forgot the name for it  but basically tests the freezing/boiling points)   And with the brake strips they test for copper most newer vehicles don't have copper in their brake system(I think they use nickel now) so it's never going to test how ""worn"" it is because it'll never read it. It'll always test good even after 300k+ miles."
592,Dont sell it. Work hard  get promoted. Youll be able to afford storage fees no problem. I have my first car I bought 22 years ago. I will restore it eventually. You only get 1 first car. I talk to old men all the time at car events  and many of them regret selling a car that had sentimental value.   Stay positive. Stay motivated. Keep your beloved car.
593,Don't use guides OP.  This game deserves to be played without any guides.  That said  you'll need a Mage and a Healer in your party. The other 2 members aren't that important.  Origins + Awakening plays more like a crpg (Baldurs Gate  Divinity Original Sin) and should easily get you 100hrs of gameplay.  Dragon Age 2 is the weakest entry but I still enjoyed it. It's more a hack n slash version of the game.  Inquisition is the Mass Effect version of the game. So you'll feel more comfortable with this game.
594,Dont use real currency. Some games have tried it and almost all players hate it. Even if its just 1 cent  theres a psychological aversion to seeing a digital game that *requires* money to play.    I would consider an energy system  which is very common in mobile games. You start with 20 tokens  and you automatically recharge 1 token per hour (to a max of 20). Playing the standard mode costs 2 tokens. You can give out bonus tokens for achievements  events  etc.   Then most games have some way to pay money to refill your energy  recharge it faster  or just unlock unlimited energy. I wouldnt make it a minigame because some player might love the main game but hate the minigame.
595,Don't you mean DB5 for 007? Anyways  to answer the question:  - 68 Mustang Fastback - Bullitt - 74 Dodge Monaco Sedan - Blues Brothers  - 2011 Camaro SS - Transformers - 1977 British Leyland Mini 1000 - Mr. Bean
596,Dope. They build such good worlds and characters. Even if they dont get everything right everytime  its a studio I support and been a fan of since Max Payne. They give a shit about their art.  Just that YouTube vid of the anniversary of Payne tells you everything. Good guys.
597,DOS1 can run fine with an Intel Core 2 duo processor  but DOS2 wants an i5.    It could be sketchy running DOS2 if you already have to make compromises to run DOS1.  Consoles struggle with DOS2 as well.  The game is prone to absurd load times on PS4 and Switch  and it can crash upon loading larger lategame areas.
598,DOS2 is a great starting point yes.  It has quite a learning curve in the first few hours  but once you get about halfway through act 1 you should have the basics down.  The other good intro is Pillars of Eternity 1 and 2 (gotta play them in order  one continuous story).  Playing through it felt like it was intentionally designed as a good intro to isometric RPGs.    I recommend waiting on Arcanum.  It is fantastic and you should play it  but it has a very old school interface and game structure that make it very difficult to get into unless you're already familiar with the genre.
599,DOS2 was my first CRPG and I had a lot of fun with it!   Since then Ive been playing Pillars of Eternity 2 which is also good and probably easier to approach if you have experience with D&D (I dont!).   Now that an XBox release date has been announced  Disco Elysium will be next on the list for me.
600,Dq11 play it its fun and direct   just learn the basics of moves and prep pep & p5 very dungeon crawlers but I didnt feel the need to grind as every dungeon you grind in it to touch story points  and Im assuming SHIN is gonna be more like p5 and Grindy open world wise
601,Dragon Age Inquisition is kinda like that.  The most flexibility comes usually from cRPGs  there are very very few aRPGs that allow a real customization  usually most kind of specialize but ultimately play almost the same  like Witcher 3.  Kingdoms of Amalur might be what you want  althought I have not played it. Check the remaster they made
602,Dragon Age Origins. It was made in 2009 and the graphics are kind of trash and the combat  in my opinion  kind of sucks. However  if you can get past that  its my best choice for role play.   Character creation  origin story choice  And your disposition as a character has an affect on the relationship with companions and the world itself.   For example  if you choose to sacrifice a few NPCs then a morally good companion might leave your company and a morally evil companion might become your best friend  that sort of thing.
603,Dragon Quest 11.  It has cartoon violence  no blood splatters like Baldur's Gate.  Barkley: Shut Up and Jam: Gaiden has BASKETBALL FIGHTING  Undertale and Deltarune can both be won without attacking enemies.  You still dodge their attacks  but you don't have to hit anyone.
604,Dragon's Dogma Dark Arisen Western Style Action JRPG made by Capcom.  Kingdoms of Amalur ReReckoning Action RPG  with a 5 to 10 hour expansion releasing later this year or early next  ReReckoning comes with all the previous DLC.  Those are two of my favorites.  Not well known because released originally during Elder Scrolls V Skyrim time period and no marketing.  They were remastered and rereleased for PS4 and Xbox One.  Dragon's Dogma is also on Nintendo Switch not sure if ReReckoning is.
605,Drivers would be helping these tech companies to test their software  which means they are effectively working for these companies.   In other times  drivers should be getting paid for doing work  but these tech companies found a way to not only have people working for free  but they go even further  they are now requiring the workers to pay them.
606,Driving in Germany was an absolute joy. They are drivers  they know how the roads work and they respect it. I was blown away that in traffic jams they all pull over to leave space for emergency vehicles. The speed limit never came into play because I was driving a Ford Transit diesel  I was looking in the rear mirrors more than the front not to get in the way.
607,Drop it and play Wrath instead. Like others have said  the game turns into a slog down the line  it is far to long and filled with menial side quests and boring busywork.  Wrath focus far more on actual story and world building  the world map is tiny compared to Kingmaker for it has actual proper dungeon and story progression design and is not filled with a thousand different tiny zones with a few mobs in them. I swear  a large portion of Kingmaker for me was spent on loading screens.  Wrath is far more like Baldurs Gate 2  a healthy mix between story progression and free roaming.
608,Drove an 04 G35 sedan for years. RWD  ~300ish hp (after I modded it)  handled really well for the time  cost less to run than a BMW. My brother had an 03 325 at the time. My car was faster  more reliable but wasn't as comfortable and didn't corner quite as hard as they were a bit heavier. After some easy mods (plenum spacer  intake  headers  cats  exhaust -kept stock muffler  springs  swaybars wheels and tires) it kept up or beat just about anything in its segment.    Buuuut of course it hit the 'nissan 200' and started nickel and diming me.    Every time I drive my 4 cylinder Honda I miss that VQ reserve of power. Nice meaty torque band but my god that think drank fuel even before the mods.    For their time they were a straight shot across the bow of the Germans  nowadays they're lease-queens because they depreciate so fast
609,DSMs.  All through the 90's and 2000's  they were rode hard and put away wet. Slap on a big turbo and crank the boost  run 11's  blow it up  go get another one  rinse  repeat...  They have all but disappeared now.
610,Dual-wielding big swords with heavy armor and conversation skills. Usually choose chaotic good  but ending up acting like a lawful good.  1 warrior  1 bard  3 warrior  5 dragon disciple + able learner as first feat DnD 3.5 rules.
611,Dungeon Lords Collectors Edition   with the filereadordnung mod for some fixes.  Also run the game in windows xp compability and start in admin mode to avoid savegame corruptions... Generally use multiple saves just in case.  You can play the whole game in multiplayer too.
612,"Dungeons & Dragons seems to be designed [for three rounds for a typical encounter](https://rpg.stackexchange.com/a/93185) -- each player gets to contribute three times  the enemies fall faster since not all of them will survive all three rounds.  Encounters that are ""hard"" should need each player to contribute four or even five times before it's resolved one way or another."
613,"Dungeons and Dragons (back in 2nd edition) released several products with accompanying CDs.  Some were just background music  but others were actually tied to the game.  For instance  one was meant to go along with a magic item (a skull) that you could give to the players as a guide to the planes.  They could ask it ""tell me about plane X"" (ie. play track 5)."
614,Durance uses three designated dice whereby the results are determined by which beats which in clockwise fashion. Intransitive dice could be give interesting skew to it (though the rules are geared around possible matches and a maximum of two/minimum of 1 dice being higher than the next one round so that would need addressing).
615,Each race has its own back story. Mage has its own specific backstory. Mage is the most op unless if you have friendly fire on then youll end up decimating your own team.    Play the game then play it again and again. Theres lots of different choices  possibilities  and outcomes so its worth multiple playthroughs  Get all the dlc its worth  especially the dlc characters
616,Each time I see that game I'm reminded of that god-awful  badly designed last dungeon who sapped all the fun away.  I've been holding onto buying wotr because I still got bad memories from the overall balance of the enemies.
617,"Edit: I'm not too arrogant toadmit when I'm wrong. It is 100% illegal  as others here have stated. Sampling of any sort requires you to get permission from the creator and copyright holder. That being said some people get away with it  for various reasons. As for the risking it thing I definitely would say you ought to consult r/legaladvice and be specific about whether you're selling the game for profit or not. Best of luck to your game.  Original Comment: It's in a legal gray area  and you can pretty much get away with it so long as it's not just the same song. This is how so many songs sample other songs  they make it into something new.     Also  a fun fact for ya here is that technically  the MOTHER games didn't even have the rights to some of their samples. The main instrument for ""Dummy"" and ""Napstablook"" are sampled from an earthbound song  which sampled it from the Little Rascals theme! So it's a sample of a sample.     Most music lawsuits occur outside of the video game realm  on huge hit singles that sound vaguely similar to other songs. You'll probably be fine doing whatever you want with sound fonts/samples."
618,Edit: My post isn't about FWD being bad  it's about FWD cars having certain advantages  but when you make it a coupe your basically killing off one of the biggest advantages of FWD cars (interior space).   With the new pictures of the Acura Integra coming out I've been seeing a lot of disappointment that it's not a 2 door coupe and all I can think is why would anyone want a FWD 2 door coupe?   Like  I can understand wanting a coupe in a sports car or really anything sporty and RWD  but in a FWD car? Like  isn't the point of a FWD car is that it's packaging is efficient so you can give more space to the passenger/cargo area?   Some might say that the coupe would weigh less than the hatch or sedan version  but that's not really true these days.   If it's just purely for aesthetics I guess I could understand that  but that just makes me feel like your getting a lot less car for mildly better looks.  Can someone explain to me why they want a FWD coupe?
619,EDIT: No spoilers please - beyond Stag Lord part where I am up to.  I just killed the stag lord and I find to suddenly be handed a kingdom feels cheap at a lowly level 4 or so (I know people have been handed kingdoms for doing nothing in real life but that was usually through nepotism not as some stranger in the land which is the premise of the game's story) and totally ruins the spirit of adventure for me.  I want to be an adventurer not some nanny to a state.  I am not talking about the gameplay aspect which is what most people's gripe is with the kingdom management  but the roleplay part of sucking the adventure out of exploring.  You are now just traipsing from A to B to take care of your imposed duties and suppress whatever issue is encroaching on your kingdom rather than exploring a mysterious and untamed land.  Totally sucked out the sense of wonder for me.  I also felt this way about Pathfinder Kingmaker  even though that part came later after you had done quite a bit of adventuring and could be felt to have earned it. As soon as it happened and many of the npcs were now giving you airs and graces and the stories were based around you tending to your keep and your title it bored me. The adventure felt trite then.  I suppose what I mean is that it feels very incongruous that a Lord would still be out adventuring because they would just have one of their lackeys doing it. Even if they loved adventuring the bureaucratic burden of running a kingdom would likely forbid them being off gallivanting all the time.
620,"Eh... I don't know if I ever truly ""moved away from"" D&D.   I got into the old World of Darkness and Ars Magica while I was still playing AD&D. When that group splintered  I played 3e for a while when it came out  but soon got burnt out on Feat creep and the new norm of what always felt like system-encouraged min-maxing. Shadowrun entered the mix between the two  I think.  After that 3e group fell apart  I took an extended hiatus from D&D  dabbling in a variety of other systems  all of which brought something to the table that D&D didn't. All of them still do. I didn't care for 4e  and have come to the conclusion that 5e isn't much better. Personally  I still like AD&D the best of them all  but it all boils down to other systems providing things--whether gameplay  verisimilitude  tone  themes  you name it--better than D&D does."
621,Elections a month ago and already have an interim result?  *Cries in Dutch coalition talks that are ongoing since march*  Could be worse  like Belgium.   On a more serious note  nice to know I can still floor my car and try to see how fast it goes on the occasional trip through Germany.
622,Elfen Lied  I used to love the emotional bits and the relationship between the two leads but now I cant really look past all the stupid ecchi harem bullshit  unlikeable characters and edgy gore. The op is pretty great  though.
623,End game.  I like the way Dragon Quest XI handles it  it almost feels like a hybrid of end game and NG+. Many of the end game/super bosses are actually just bosses from earlier in the game but with buffed up stats and new moves  but you also get a lot of new story content (and there's story justification for why you're fighting so many bosses again) and the true ending of the game is at the end of all the post game stuff.
624,"Episode thoughts:  * shin showing off again lol   * commander don't know shin a God I'd give him a 10 * ""he's the reaper"" that's right bitch show him respect  * ""you've graduated"" well that was fast  * yay fiado is back lol  * goddess of victory mascot to cute lol * ""reaper symbol"" daddy's back  * I knew Eugene was going thr flags were to real  * He'll never see his sister :( * Jesus that was brutal      This show is outstanding man it's crazy"
625,EU authorities: We will made USB-C mandatory for everything.   Industry: From now on  we will call everything USB-C.   Seriously  what the point of making connector mandatory  if electrically it will be of unavoidable broad range specs (power rating in particular) anyway and incompatibility still persist?
626,Even a bad ttrpg takes work to make. As others have said editing and proofreading the system is a big time dump. You used to be able to skimp on these way way back when there were little to no standards but now your game has no chance if it doesn't look like a polished professional game.   You will also need to spend a good amount of time creating the system and testing it. Don't just rely on a single tester or test group. You need several because each person and player will see the game differently so they will all find different issues. Also encourage testers to exploit the game so you can find weaknesses and flaws.  Also if you do ever decide to publish and print physical copies on your own make sure to use quality material and don't be afraid to ask for a real price. I helped someone put an rpg together and he kept wanting to sell it too cheap and kept using the worst materials to make the book out of. He really either should have just sold it as a pdf or had enough confidence in his product to print it properly so he could ask for the money he deserved.   Honestly I would encourage writing a supplement or setting with a few small rule changes for an existing system first. This would help you learn some of the basics of game creation before jumping in to the deep end of trying to make a full system.  As an aside a lot of long term rpg players try to make systems but what many find out is to make a unique one that is good is hard. Many of the great concepts already exist which is why for the most part you rarely see a truly new concept for a system. They are usually settings placed on solid systems like how much of the video gaming industry uses the Unreal Engine. So my advice  if you haven't already  is play as many different systems as possible first because you may find a system you like and you can tweak to fit what you want.
627,Even for a seasoned indie dev team (10 years experience) we constantly overestimate how much time it takes.  Remember to keep it SUPER simple for your first game. Be absolutely sure it is ACTUALLY basic and simple. You'll learn more from shipping something simple then over scoping and not finishing it.
628,Even if I support this  its probably gonna accelerate whatever plans Apple have for a port less iPhone. That said I hope Im wrong  I love wireless charging but given its inherent inefficiency Im worried about it being the only option.
629,"Even if you're 100% in the legal right  someone can still sue you. They'd lose  but you still have to defend yourself  and that costs money.  I'm not saying this is likely  but if someone with deep pockets doesn't like what you're doing  it is possible to force you to concede a point  even if you'd actually win.  The question is not just ""is this legal?""  but also  ""is it in the financial interests of a corporation to stop me from doing this?""  While laws against [Vexatious Litigants](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vexatious_litigation) do exist  they're not enforced especially often.  It didn't stop Bethesda from bringing legal action against Mojang for wanting to call their game ""Scrolls""."
630,"Even with this ""revelation"" the problem is that his channel is one of the good ones.  Other channels  especially unity related are filled with content creators that present themselves as veterans  but their knowledge is shallow deep."
631,Ever consider making a game for the web? You can use ThreeJS or simply make a 2d game via CSS and Javascript. Sometimes being unique can be a good thing.      This guy made an RPG using Javascript and CSS and even ported it to Steam to be played like a traditional PC game via Electron.   https://youtu.be/nHaiLWUaWWw
632,Ever since DP became a thing  Ive had issues with either cables or monitors. In the early years DVI and dual-link DVI were far more reliable. Nowadays I use HDMI where I can  because it has been more reliable than DP.  Fuck DP and the constant issues it has.
633,Every game has a game engine. If it not an off the shelf engine  its a custom engine. Its called an engine because of how it works. In simple terms  its a real-time processing engine that takes input and does work. That the work is the simulation and presentation of the game is the game part of game engine.  A game engine has a specific anatomy. There is a game loop. In the game loop there are a series of update steps; Like input updates  server updates  physics updates  game state updates  and finally render updates. Each happens in turn many times a second  like pistons in an you guessed it.
634,"Every single E36. Obtainable beautiful little cheap cars now but damn if you can't keep them on the road. And I'm going to get a hundred replies of  ""my 328 has 200k on it! I've only replaced 19 water pumps  6 radiators  replaced Vanoss 92 times  rod bearings went 3 times  etc."" Trust me  I'm not hating on the cars I love them  but they're unreliable turds lol"
635,Every time hardware-level bans come up in the news it always sparks off a new wave of controversy.  But I have a proposal for those that don't like the idea of hardware-level bans:  Don't cheat.  I'll rephrase slightly in case it's confusing.  Do not cheat.  &nbsp;  Riot is not the first to do hardware level bans  and while I will actively campaign against their kernel-level anti-cheat system that operates at all times with no user oversight  permissions  or control  Server-side hardware checksum bans I have no problem with. Because I don't cheat. And neither should you.  Worried about false positives? Then this is an area where a TPM key should improve the situation. Because yes it is theoretically possible to have an exact match in terms of hardware of some other cheaters system  but it's very unlikely to have an exact match in terms of hardware *and* have the same TPM key.  &nbsp;  Also  a lot of handwringing over anti-cheat systems comes from cheat-makers.  Turns out making and selling cheats is a profitable business  as long as they don't get caught  and there are forums and marketplaces focused on selling cheats for popular games. Whenever an anti-cheat policy threatens their business  the members of these forums  and the makers of the cheats  will start up astro-turf campaigns claiming that the anti-cheat policies negatively affect non-cheating gamers. So take all of the hand-wringing over the recent adoption of TPM/hardware level banning with a huge grain of salt.
636,Everybody is different. Some people thrive learning by themselves  some people do better by going to school.  Teaching yourself is *hard.* People forget this. When you go to school  youre taking a hard job and hiring teachers to help you out. When youre learning on your own  youre doing the whole job of learning & teaching all by yourself.  Self-taught programmers can end up with skill / knowledge gaps  they can make slow progress learning  they can end plateau  they might have no good place to ask questions when they get stuck. They may not know how to challenge themselves. They pick projects which are too hard or too easytoo hard and you fail without learning much  too easy and you succeed without learning much.  If youre self-taught  all of these problems can be solvedbut lots of people never bother to solve them. You end up with a few brilliant self-taught programmers and lots of people who are just missing chunks of their education.
637,Everyday is a battle. Overall it's war.   Sometimes you rout  sometimes you retreat  sometimes you charge ahead.  But despite your losses  your failures  your depressions and your endless questioning...  **The War Goes On.**
638,"Everyone else is right about the therapist. Beside that  I have a suggestion-- I think you're writing too much. Not too often or too compulsively  everyone else covered that. I literally mean *too much*. If you're actively working out ""how could I turn this into a game""  you've basically run the scenario in your head. What's the fun of having a party go through it when you've already done that? I say this because some people  and I'm one of them  get bored of a creative idea before they actually execute the idea (write the campaign  write the novel  paint the painting) because they've spent too much time thinking about it first. Dgmr  some creative people need to plot the whole thing out first. But some people  it means no longer caring about it.   Suggestion: write one line. Whatever the most salient thing is. ""Vampires as deep-ocean scientists."" Write it  close the notebook and physically put it in another room  and go back to watching the media. If you think of another idea later  add it. LATER. Spend time reading these when you're stuck and need inspiration  but don't let the notebook replace DMing and watching. (Also  look up ""cat vacuuming"" for a similar thing novel writers do when they get immersed in worldbuilding or research or minor chores as a way of not actually sitting down writing. There are lots and lots of strategies for this.)"
639,Everyone is complicating this far too much  to answer your question  yes  downsizing will make your speedo read high. But typically you will compensate by fitting a tire with the same diameter of your original tires. Meaning no difference on the speedo.
640,Everyone is John is really interesting and I feel like it adds a lot of strategy that you wouldnt normally use in D&D. I really love being the DM because I feel like I dont need to plan as much because the story is driven more by the players
641,Everything nowadays is electronic and programmable  so give me the ability to use it. Have a CVT and don't want to feel fake shifts  uncheck the box. Have an annoying idiot reminder  select a calmer one. Want daytime running lights  put a check in the box. So many things could be user programmable.  Imagine a Ford Transit with open controls. Everything is electronic inputs so it wouldn't be that hard to give handicap accessible functions. USB controllers for those with lower limb disabilities. Foot controls for upper mobility issues.
642,"Everything on Wranglers is incredibly easy.  What's difficult is tire sizing once you've gone ""off-menu"" in terms of lift heights  removed bodywork that's in the way  swapped wheels with more favorable backspacing  changed fenders  etc - it's all so modular  that you really don't know what will fit or not until someone tries it."
643,Exactly. When i upgrade friends laptops to SSD from HDD i won't do it unless they are present so they can see their old drive be destroyed after cloning. They do tend to like walloping it with the hammer i supply
644,Explore every area thoroughly + speak w everyone (npcs included) is a good rule of thumb to go w when playing DA. Don't go in expecting it to be like ME (not that DA is bad by any means; its just a different game--you get my drift) but I hope youll have fun regardless! DA + ME are some of my fave franchises.
645,fabs are so wide in extension that solar panels alone would easily provide more energy than the fan needs alone. And according to several agencies that carbon negative represented by the excess green electricity counts towards carbon neutrality  which is kind of cheating
646,Fallout 1 and 2. Two of the greatest RPGs ever obscured by (even at release) awful graphics and counterintuitive mechanics. Games were that good that even with those flaws are considered RPGs classics.
647,Fallout 3-4 and Skyrim come to mind.  You can safely unplug your headphones from those game and  watch YouTube while travelling the words to fill in the dead air. Or while doing quests with little dialog (or going through an skiable/annoying part of a game for the 100th time).
648,Fallout 4 was created after Skyrim  employing the same and new tactics to draw in the mainstream crowd. That crowd isn't really into filling out all the sidequests they can  they just do a few things that are interesting and trudge resolutely towards the end of the game. So you have to give enough XP to play endgame for any given straight path to the end  because they don't take extra time to build characters. So any three or four quest lines has to be enough  and if you do all hundred and one  you'll be able to beat the game about 30 times over.
649,"Fallout has been an RPG since 1997  so I wouldn't really call FO4's RPG mechanics as ""tacked on"". In fact  Fallout fans have complained that FO4 has the least RPG mechanics among all the games in the series.  Odyssey is far more complicated  but its evolution is actually natural. RPG mechanics have slowly crept into the series  and it wasn't until Origins that the series leaned more into RPG territory. You can even say that Odyssey has now become a full-blown RPG at this point.  If you still want to play RPGs with rewarding narratives  I suggest you try out Disco Elysium  Fallout: New Vegas  and The Outer Worlds. If you want narrative-driven games  you may check out Life is Strange and most TellTale games."
650,Fallout: New Vegas in terms of story. I was very surprised that I could do X while having enough stats and completely change the story direction. Also Kingdom Come: Deliverance. Killing the whole bandit camp with a poison is fun as hell  and it is possible to kill some of the important NPCs. It doesn't affect the story though.
651,Fantastic OP. That they made such a thing for a television showing of only 7 episodes really shows how much they'll throw at Demon Slayer now.  As an anime-only  I do wonder if there was anything different about this episode compared to the movie?
652,"Favorite would be the random rapier I rolled up for a  PC.  Said PC was the Swashbuckler leader of the party in a 3E sailing game (set in Moonshae Isles).  PCs are getting hired around level 4 to go deal with some pirates.  Swashbuckler tries to convince the King to give them a magic item as part of payment.  Rolls nat 20.  So I go to roll one up.  Roll randomly a few times to get a weapon we have a player that is proficient in  get rapier.  Perfect  just right for the guy who got the nat 20.  Roll for magic properties.  +1  check.  Flaming  check.  Intelligent.  Wait  what?  Yea  rolled intelligence.  Great  now to figure out its bonuses.  End up rolling that it has telepathy  10 ranks in a Knowledge skill  and minor image once a day.  Other than the first roll to pick a weapon they could use  these were all single rolls to see what it is.  Knowledge skill was Fashion.  Minor image was it telling its wearer what to wear each day.  Personality?  Well  its a Flaming Rapier  what else would it be?  Guard brings it out and hands it to the Swashbuckler in a jewel encrusted box with the command word etched on it.  He pulls it out  says the command word  and everyone in the small room hears ""Oh HELL NO  You are NOT wearing me out in public looking like that.""  Entire party bust out laughing."

655,"Feel like from Valve's perspective they'd rather see people benchmark  say  Civ 6 versus the Switch version. Or various indie games or ports/remakes that also exist on Switch. Not to say they won't appreciate benchmarks for games that aren't on Switch at all  but in those cases they'd probably rather they be compared to other launcher versions that might have horrible linux support compared to the Steam one instead of doing a ""here's the Steam version on a PC versus the Steam version on a SteamDeck"".      They're not hoping that people buy SteamDeck to just play their existent Steam library on it at lower quality  but portable. Or at least  I would doubt that the business plan is to make money off of hardware sales. Rather  they're hoping to convert sales from other storefronts to Steam using the SteamDeck as leverage. In particular  Nintendo's store but also GOG or Epic or Windows if they have horrible linux support. To just review it Steam game on SteamDeck versus Steam game on PC is basically like doing a laptop review where you're only benching games versus PS5 instead of other laptops. Useful info for some people I guess  but not all you'd want to see.             There's a lot that a consumer would want to know here if they were looking to buy a portable. What games will they have to re-buy on Steam because the linux support is bad on other stores? Or is it not even an issue? What kind of advantages can they expect to find in games that they could have bought on Switch if they wanted portability? I think that's what will mostly move sales and cement the product if Valve actually has an advantage to offer there whereas if it's only bought up by or good for people wanting to play their existent library? Valve probably doesn't bother much with it going forward."
656,Feels like we're moving kinda fast between all these timeskips  but their time at the academy probably isn't all that important anyway  Of course  only Shin could pull off something as insane as performing a backflip with a quadrupedal mech. That red-haired dude was just a cunt. He has the audacity to get mad at someone else for his screw up.  I thought the memorial was a nice gesture  even though the squad doesn't seem too happy about it; I wonder why. Can't believe they brought Fido back  though; but I'm glad they did because god knows the same can't happen with their human ones.  The new mechs are looking slick as all hell but it's a shame we couldn't see the whole squad fighting in one battlefield. I guess even once they got away  they still can't escape the discrimination. These bastards should honestly consider themselves lucky that they're on their side after seeing that display.  This mascot tradition sounds weird as hell  and I guess even the people in-universe agree with the sentiment. Just who thought about this in the first place? An animal mascot would've made more sense over a small child.  Eugene's death was all kinds of messed up and disturbing  but I don't think anyone failed to see it coming  especially with the giant glowing red flag planted in the cafeteria scene. Poor guy really should've heeded Shin's advice and left the military  and now Shin's resumed his role as the Reaper for his own comrades. Fuck.  I thought for a second that the older soldier there was calling Shin out for being heartless instead of berating the red-haired guy. To be honest  I agree with him that they should leave this fight behind and learn to live a normal life  but I can't deny their impact to the battlefield  and the fact that they can't imagine any other way of living; at least  as long as the war is still going.
657,"Fellow RPG gamers!  With the recent ""Big in Japan Sale"" on PSN  I started thinking about diving into some lesser known action RPGs. Based on overwhelming recommendations  I grabbed 13 Sentinels: Aegis Rim (which is more visual novel  but I got it anyway) and CRYSTAR (which I am loving right now).  Do any of you have any console or PC recommendations? I've always wanted to try one of the new Atelier Ryza games or even a game based on an anime. Note  I already own Sword Art Online: Fatal Bullet  which I also love.  Thanks everyone!"
658,FF Tactics and Tactics Ogre are deliberately obtuse  arcane  and overwhelming.  For simplified clear mechanics but awesome gameplay:  * **Advance Wars** 1 and 2 on GBA emulation * **Into the Breach**  the designer is on record as saying he hated hidden arcade unknown variables in overly complex games like FF Tactics  he wanted every mechanic to be readable and clear and known and transparent * **XCOM 2012 and XCOM 2**.  These are hard and have a big learning curve but are great.  Sorry if those arent really RPGs.
659,FF16 should just let you play \*as a crystal\* and the plot is to go about the lands trying to find the right chosen one to enslave to your will. Act III you've identified your chosen one  but have to kill their friends and family so they have no where to turn but you. Final boss is battling your chosen one to give them amnesia. Which then sets up the start of FFXVI-2.
660,FF7 Remake is a modern dystopia.    Shin Megami Tensei: Nocturne takes place right after a modern-day apocalypse.  Commercial and government structures are still intact  but have been abandoned except for demons and lost souls scavenging for scraps.
661,"Fiasco and Dread are the two of the best diceless RPGs. (Technically 1st ed. Fiasco used dice  but they were for tracking and no math was involved.  2nd Ed. is completely diceless.)  Dread requires more GM prep  and can be hard for a GM that isn't used to thinking on their feet  as it requires a lot of improvisation when it comes to adjudication outcomes and especially pacing the pulls from the tower.  It's also not especially well suited for people with motor control issues  or players who are especially risk averse.  Fiasco is fantastic.  It's GMless  there are a ton of playsets for it that establish the setting  and the general parameters of the game are established collaboratively by the players.  There are almost no crunch bits (the rulebook is like 8 pamphlet size pages and it's mostly descriptive or examples). It rewards creativity and selfless play  as it's inevitable that bad things are going to happen.  It's not good for overly competitive players  or those who excessively metagame  as half the fun comes from steering into the bad things instead of trying to ""win""."
662,FIDO is back guys! Now more stronger and better. We can assume  that it was a new body since we can see his old body in the glass memorial.  Also  we know Eugene is gonna get it when he starts talking about her sister. Added with the picture taking  which I assume Frederica saw his end via her abilities  that is why she insisted to have a picture taken.  The transition to his death scene is so abrupt that it is so realistic. No heroic feats  no speeches  just sudden death. He may be considered lucky because shin found him and was able to have at least a final request (the pendant) and end his suffering more faster.
663,FIDO LIVES LET'S GO!!!  Also  R.I.P. Eugene. Man died too soon.  Back to back episodes without Lena is surprising. I really want to see what she's been up to. As much as I'm enjoying seeing the crew's new lives in Giad (and all 3 episodes this season have been great so far)  I hope we get back to her soon.
664,Fightin Pose - Great Jahy will not be defeated.  Sing my pleasure - Vivy  All of the Songs from Quintessential Quintuplets  ( especially Hatsukoi)  Easy Love - Dont toy with me   Miss Nagatoro   Omoide Shiritori - Higehiro
665,Final fantasy 15 has a completely modern setting. You drive around in a hot rod with your friends in a world that looks like the western united states  and stop at diners and truck stops where the waiter will ask you to go kill a bunch of goblins out back. The game has its fair share of issues but I really liked the contemporary setting mixed with the magic and fantasy of the FF universe
666,Final Fantasy 2 pixel remaster - after finishing FF1 for the first time last week  moved onto 2 this week.  So far it's decent  though I'm only an hour or so in.  I really love the music in these remasters  it is SO good.  Final Fantasy XIV - working through a replay of the MSQ and am 1/3 thru Stormblood I think.  I think I'm on track to finish my replay of MSQ prior to EW dropping  so all good here.
667,Final Fantasy has one of the most split fanbases I have ever seen. It is very possible to speak to three different Final Fantasy fans and noone has played the same game.  I no longer visit /r/FinalFantasy   barely anyone there has played my favourite FFs in the 1-6 games which just got Pixel Remasters. It is all just cosplays  discussion about the PS1 games and the odd flamewar about XIII Fabula Nova Crystallis. Much better to wait for the occasional FF thread in /r/JRPG .
668,Final Fantasy Tactics is a great game  but it can certainly be tough for beginners to get into. Here is a list of some tactical RPGs that are more beginner friendly:  * [Final Fantasy Tactics Advance (GBA)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Final_Fantasy_Tactics_Advance) * [Shining Force (Sega Genesis/GBA/PC/iOS)](https://store.steampowered.com/app/71120/Shining_Force/) * [Fire Emblem: The Binding Blade (GBA)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fire_Emblem:_The_Binding_Blade) * [Avadon: The Black Fortress (PC/iOS)](https://store.steampowered.com/app/112100/Avadon_The_Black_Fortress/) * [Battle for Esturia (PC)](https://store.steampowered.com/app/1514780/Battle_for_Esturia/) * [The Banner Saga (PC/Android/iOS)](https://store.steampowered.com/app/237990/The_Banner_Saga/) * [Tactics Ogre: The Knight of Lodis (GBA)](https://ogrebattlesaga.fandom.com/wiki/Tactics_Ogre:_The_Knight_of_Lodis)  The Shining Force series is particularly nice  as it doesn't have perma-death and the initial battles are pretty forgiving.
669,Final Fantasy X is a must play. There is a reason why they ported it everywhere to every console  even though it is a 20-year-old game. And yes  as you can imagine  it was revolutionary for the rpg genre in 2001; thats why it has so many fans.
670,Finally an upgrade to pair with my 3080  my 9900k is good but I've been itching for a good equal counterpart for the GPU. Hopefully this domino effects a price drop for the higher end 58/5900x & i9 10/11900k's so people have good more affordable options.
671,Finally got to try mothership recently.  Game (one shot) lasted an hour.  Group explored 3 areas and a connecting corridor.  We rolled some stress rolls.  Redshirt died first  of a heart attack. Then death/stress cascade over the next 15minutes. TPK. End.
672,Finally! The first action packed episode of the 2nd cour!  I loved the real-estate ad in the intro. Rudy looked so happy touring us in his apartment. Free food  a nice view. It has a security guard and everything! I hope it comes with fire insurance   So that guy from the Demon continent is a Saint ranked North-God style huh? I think this is the first time we have witnessed that high of a rank in the North-God style. It fits horrible kidnappers like him.  Speaking of which  Rudy taking so long to decide on saving people made me fume a little. I know they treated him badly  and Rudy isnt presented as a hero type (which I love about this series)  but the part where he almost made the guy walk away with the kid was frustrating. I wanna believe that even if the Holy Beast didnt take initiative he wouldve still stopped him  coz I dont really like the alternative...  So long Grandpa Boreas. Your granddaughter will miss you  but your Beast women maids (whom he probably bought from the same criminal organization Rudy fought) wont miss you.
673,"Find a group of people online who *like* that pitch. ""Hey guys I found this cool new system  let's plan for about four to eight sessions  who's in?"" I personally would love to join such a group if I had the time!"
674,Find an HPDE group that has low traffic  good marshals and has a good reviews for safety. If they have good instructors  they should tell you everything you need to know about etiquette and keep you from doing anything stupid. That said  take it easy and build up speed slowly as you get more comfortable on each lap.  Pick a track that has lower top speeds and has lots of run off. Like Streets of Willow is great for learning. It's a tight handling track  not a power track. And if you go off its just empty dirt. Nurburgring on the other hand has blind corners  very high speeds and the wall is right next to the track. It's not beginner friendly. I'm not assuming you live in California or Germany but I just used these examples as tracks you've likely seen on YouTube or played in sims  Also wouldn't hurt to do a couple of autocross events prior to your first HPDE. That way you're already comfortable sliding the car around before you end up on a full sized road course. And you may end up liking it too. Between track days  autocross and sim racing  you can never have too much seat time
675,finding game devs amongst *them* may be easier than finding *them* amongst game devs. by that i mean  your adult theme may have communities out there  within them people who express their interest in that theme through creating videogames. in those communities you have the added benefit of zero worries of them accepting the theme/material. Take the furry fetish for example  many many online communities  many of them expressing their interest through creating videogames  a lot of those games stay within those communities but get a lot of love from said communities. So if you want to find someone who enjoys game dev and also enjoys XXX  asking around that XXX community will likely yield results  and even reverance for you a lot quicker than you would gain from here or a regular game dev community. Many hobbies and many fetishes  have communities with forums that a good portion have dedicated video game dev/play sections for. vgs are a now long time accepted form of expression though many remain just out of general public view. For slightly more mainstream viable products  you could always speak to Richard La Ruina lol. he posts here sometimes. good luck!
676,"First of all  I love Greek mythology  and I won't fault the story  and the characters have been nicely done. But everything else about the game is horrendous.  The Tartarus levels are tedious as fuck. They all look the same  way too many places where if you miss a jump you fall to your death and start again (the game has actual respawn points to activate for when you mess up - surely falling off the world is an outdated video game design that should have gone away years ago) and the puzzles are so frustrating. I flip a lever and can't see what's changed so I have to scout the area to find out what's been activated before attempting the puzzle again (most of them are on timers) Every time a Vault of Tartarus comes up I groan because I just want to get on with the freaking story. the easiest game setting makes combat a cinch  but it needs a ""skip this puzzle bollocks"" option as well.  The world design is ugly  I don't care for the felt tip pen style visuals they've gone for  and I don't like the layout at all. There are way too many steep cliffs  so mounts aren't particularly useful because I always end up jumping off them to climb up and leap off somewhere.  And who thought it would be a nice idea to show those irritating animations every time I upgrade one of my skills? No I don't want to watch a cut scene of my character mixing a potion from 6 different angles and making a stupid pose. skip. skip. skip. skippity-skip. Just get on with it.   And those coins of Charon? I complete a deadly mission and receive the blessing of a god  but I have to save up pocket money to unlock it. Fuck that shit.  Am I missing something?"
677,First off  remember that it's perfectly okay to not know all the ins and outs of a system before you start GMing. You can learn while playing and disregard rules until you feel comfortable in the GM chair.  Secondly  I don't know what game your group is used to playing  but if it's 5e or something on a similar complexity level  I would recommend looking at Free League's games. The Year Zero engine is very easy to grasp  and there are tons of settings to choose from. The YZE does not compare to zine length systems in terms of simplicity  but it'll fit your needs if you're looking for a system with some heft without being overly complex.
678,First she got daughter-zoned  now she get's drunk-zoned.... But the chief is a real wingman  And judging from the OP I have a feeling that Sakurai-san wouldn't decline if only Kazama asked her out...  Edit:  #TANNED TOMBOY YESSSSS
679,Firstly if there is antivirus like mcfee installed  uninstall it  the only antivirus you need  is windows defender and common sense meaning don't click on shady links. Don't update to windows 11 yet since  the performance loss for amd chips haven't been mitiged so wait a month or two. Update your amd chipset and also the nvidea game ready drivers .if you wanna take it up a notch you can do  a windows reinstall  I did as soon as I got my laptop to get rid of all the bloat and have a much more smooth experience but that's optional. Even going to windows 11 it's best if it's a clean install using a bootable pendrive rather than updating but let that be after two months
680,Fisker Karma  Alfa Romeo Giulia  Late model Saab 9-3s still have a front end that looks good.  I dont know how long it will last  but I'm surprised how good Honda S2000s still look.  I dont think the pig nose grill BMWs will look good long term  it doesnt now.
681,Fisker Karma ? I just sat in one... absolutely gorgeous car and I am tempted to buy it... but I heard they are an nightmare reliability wise... look wise it looks better than a Maserati and Porsche... damn I want it.
682,FL fits dark fantasy well. It is heavily geared toward travel and survival. If you are willing to do some work and create your own encounter tables and hex map  I think it could work well. IMO you can change the race/species abilities to reflect human cultures for an all human campaign in your own setting. Progression is slow and there is not a huge amount of skills but combat can be very narratively focused and deadly. Everyone enjoys different things but our group enjoys FL far more than 5E  especially on Foundry.
683,FMA:B is a very good pick. The already mentioned Vinland Saga is also a good one.  HxH 2011 isn't constantly action packed but I have to recommend it  I just have to  it's too good.  Fate/Zero I guess?   Re:zero does have some gory af moments but idk  overall it isn't.  heck  the next anime akin to AoT  is the next AOTDecade
684,Focus on stability. You already have a car so the Miata is just a toy. Once youre in a good place again and can buy another toy in cash youll feel better than shelling out money every month for something you dont need.
685,Focus on what you enjoy is really the key piece of this advice for me. I like to 'overprepare' certain aspects of my game because I just like noodling with those parts of the game. I recommend that to everyone-- focus your game on things you like prepping.
686,Following the story itself I would put Baldur's Gate 3  then Pathfinder Wrath of the Righteous  then Solasta and last Kingmaker.   The pathfinder ones are way more complex mechanicle and both have some questionable way to handle time  the first one more than the second  there some times if you want to avance the main quest you have literally to wait days in game  and to this day I still have no idea why the developing team chose that approch. I highly recomend Wrath over Kingmaker  it's better in ever single way. Only major quest are voiced.  Solasta history is nothing award winning  but it's far from being bad. The voice acting could be better  but it is all voiced. Mechanic is more simple (dnd 5e is a lot more simple than pathfinder 1e) and the combat is very faithful to the tabletop. If you are not a fan of dnd5e  might not be for you.  Baldur's Gate 3 is the best one in my humble opinion. The problem is that it is not finished.
687,For a change of pace: while I may not be a lawyer  I am married to one  and she is super cool.  While I get that it's crappy to take credit for anyone else's achievements  I would suggest not bogging yourself down by believing that someone or some entity will sue you for taking an idea in a different direction. And no  don't bother asking anyone for permission; get this thing off the ground  make the game  make it your own and  in my experience  so long as you've put your heart & soul into it  the work will become an original. Dress it up in what you like  alter what annoys you  and test every mechanic until it smooths out into the shape that fits your vision. Once all of that is said and done (which is the hardest part  just finishing it!)  I bet nobody will even recognize the thing. Heck  you might even forget where you started.  Take [Hypertellurians](https://mottokrosh.com/machinations/hypertellurians/) for example. The author clearly states  in the back of the book  all of the systems he took apart and frankensteined together to make this  in my opinion  masterwork of TTRPG systems.   MORAL: Give credit where credit is do but  if you're going to go through the hassle of making a system  make it your own in the end.  Good luck on your game! Now don't let the bastards get you down.
688,"For a game of Mutant: Year Zero based in Australia I made a beast called the Hungering Jack\*. Basically a Shoggoth made of sentient flame-grilled patties and special sauce living in a burger shop like a hermit crab. Came with it's own cult too  nothing like watching people get fed to a giant toothy maw while a crowd chants of ""*the burgers are better*"".  \**Hungry Jacks are what we call Burger Kings in Australia.*"
689,"For a more silly gonzo type of thing  Solar blades & cosmic spells works.  For ""as rules light as it gets while still having rules for all vehicle types""  Stars without Number might work  it might be a little too serious or sim-focused for you though  although it is generally rules light.  If you want a narrative game  [Impulse Drive](https://www.drivethrurpg.com/product/190933/Impulse-Drive-Preview) should work  it's PBTA."
690,For a post-apocalyptic grim game  maybe ***Wasteland 2***. I don't know much about other post-apocalyptic games  but this one was very dark. Brutal  messed-up  depressing and mentally tyring at moments. Ok  maybe this doesn't sound very good  lol. But the world building is that good that it manages to transmit those feelings  because the post-apocalyptic world is an unforgiving place.  This game is different from the others you listed because it has party-based  turn-based combat.  There is also the more recent *Wasteland 3*  but I haven't played it yet  I don't know if it's better than the second one.
691,For a second I thought they were making a full TV already lol. Good thing I actually read the article.  If they're just announcing the base Panel for now  odds are that by the time Asus or whoever stuffs it into an actual monitor/TV  there will be hardware that can actually run most games at 4k240  even if that's only due to DLSS 2.0 or FSR.
692,"For basically every genre and style there are ""beginner""-friendly / GM-friendly systems and worlds. The question is rather: *what do you like*?  - Genre? Fantasy  real world  Sci-fi?  - Realism? Cinematic action where every car explodes or more down-to-earth feeling? - How good are you in improvisation and *Theater of Mind*? This is actually one of the most important things to determine which system is easy to GM *for you*. - How complex (not complicated) should the world be? Something generic where you can slot in easily what you need? Or something with a lot of background  where even the position of your sword can have social implications? - How complex (not complicated) should the rules be? Some superfast rules  but very open for descriptin? Or do you like to go through an equipment book and then pick up an excel sheet  because your combat drone just got some nice bonuses together with a specific build. - How abstract / storytelling-like should the rules be?   in general  many people will recommend rather open systems like *fate* or *Savage World*. Another classic recommendation is *Blades in the Dark*.  My 2 standard recommendations for an easy start would be:   - 1) Feng Shui 1st edition by Atlas Games  Hong Kong Martial Arts Action Movie Roleplaying game. You get a very interesting setting involving the battle for the literal souls of every human being ever in existence  you get a rules-light  fast and ball-to-the-walls over-the-top combat system which perfectly emulates everything from **Dirty Harry* & *Hardboiled* to *Crouching Tiger Hidden Dragon* & *Hero*. It is not without it flaws (oh god  no  its from 1996 and they did some strange stuff back then)  but for me it is the love of my (RPG) live.  I mean ... its an action movie RPG? Have you ever seen an action movie? Then you know what is expected of you! ;-)  - 2) Wrath & Glory 2020 rework by Cubicle 7  The  RPG system set *in the grim darkness of the far future  where there is only war*  the infamous *Warhammer 40k setting*. Previous WH40k rpg specialized on one specific sub-genre within that setting  W&G unifies all of them in one rule setting  where you then can build your own campaign / level of play. Set 40 000 years in the future the vast Imperium of Man  a decaying behemoth  fights against against the enemies within (heretics)  without (aliens) and beyond (space daemons). It is a dark  brutal and unforgiving universe and usually human  abhumans & aliens do not get along very well  to put it mildly. Playable  depending on the campaign you are choosing  are humans  supersoldier-humans  abhumans  space elves  space orcs and space chicken cannibal-pretadors. And space magic is basically opening a small portal to hell praying that you can close it fast enough before something from hell slips through.  SYL"
693,For CL7s They only officially sold them in Japan  so you're going to struggle to find that many English language builds. In the U.K.  most people import them to have something JDM and rare so are less likely to modify them too.   But at the end of the day it's an Accord/Acura TSX with a K20. They're are loads of builds of both so it shouldn't be hard to imagine what build options would be.
694,For comparison:  ||i9-10900|i9-11900|i9-12900| |:-|:-|:-|:-| |1-Core|146|184 (+26%)|214 (+16%)| |2-Core|286|365 (+28%)|410 (+12%)| |4-Core|558|676 (+21%)|813 (+20%)| |8-Core|1038|1189 (+15%)|1497 (+26%)|
695,For dragon age 2. Dragon age 2 is actually pretty fun once you understand 3 important things.  A. All of its problems come down to how long the devs got to work on that game. Its actually amazing that we got what we did oven how short that time was. Actual work on the game was under a year. And Im total it was only slightly over a year of pre production to release. So understand a lot of things werent fleshed out or polished before release and there wasnt a way to update these like you can now.  B. Because of the lack of time you loos a lot. You will play through the same dungeon  or mansion  or cave  or passage  or whatever a million times. They couldnt add more than one of something. So unless its a very specific place in the actual city  chances are  its just the same place youve already been to somewhere else. And a part of that  armor customization is gone  and thats that. Places are the same  side characters armor never change  and many quests are filler for exp  but theres also a lot of good ones.  C. This game is a bridge game. Its almost like a standalone expansion than an actual game. It is a game that is meant to take you from the time of DAO/DAA to DAi. Its meant to set up everything in DAi. Its essentially a prequel expansion to DAi in all honesty. Dont view it as its own game. View it as the prologue of DAi. Everything you do in Dragon Age 2 is meant to set up whats coming next. Which is honestly what makes the game so good. What you do has serious effects later on  Lore wise.
696,For dragon age inquisition. I actually REALLY enjoyed he combat in this game. It was the healthiest mix between DAO and DA2. I hope they make it a bit more action like in DA4  while still having the current strategy portion  but I loved the combat.  And get really into it. There are SO MANY builds you can do. I have a battkemage build that allows me to have a magic barrier and a max guard  whilst never loosing either of those defense so long as Im doing damage  which means I can deal massive damage while being upfront in battle and never loosing health. I have a warrior build that just never looses guard ever and can deal serious damage and control shielded targets.  Get involved with the side characters  except Vivian. Im kidding slightly. Vivian was voiced so well  and her dialogue is great. Shes so great  that I genuinely hate her with a passion. That is a serious compliment. BioWare did amazing with all the characters in DAi. My original team was Me(a mage)  ironbull  Blackwall  and Egg head mcgee. I still love that group the most  but Ive found it hard to pick a party post that original team. Cause I also love Dorian  and cole  and varric  and Cassandra  and have come to really enjoy sara. I wish Cullen was a possible party member  and scout Harding should be a romance option but its fine.   Again the advice is pretty simple. Talk to everyone  go everywhere  and do everything. Theres A LOT you can miss in DAi. Its a huge game. And honestly  I really love DAi. I dont get the people who dislike it. Combat was fun and engaging on higher difficulty  the characters are some of the best dragon age has had  the story is really good when you factor in the final dlc  and it expanded so much on dragon age lore.
697,For everyone crying about how they should make new games  please think about what youre saying. RDR2 just released 3 years ago and took 8 years to develop. The result? A masterpiece. If you keep hounding them for releases theyll just start pushing out crap.
698,For example  the 2011 Volvo S60 uses one of two battery sizes depending on whether it has premium audio or not. But Autozone  Advance  etc. dont even list the larger premium audio battery size.  Edit: it seems at least AutoZone fixed this issue. But Im sure many other cars have similar issues when searching for parts.
699,"For me  and for others it will be different   I feel you nailed it in the ""I WAS Christian"" part.  In more shared narrative games. I feel like I am always an actor playing a character. Trying to think what would be good for moving the story. More like an improv theater troupe. Really more like an improv theater troupe with scenarios like the classic Commedia dell'Arte. I sort of feel like the game is to create a satisfying narrative from under the mask of my character. I am always aware of that narrative structure and creating a satisfactory narrative is sort of the goal of the game. There will still be obstacles and unknown randomized outcomes to make it less determistic  more game-like. But the goal is narrative.  Often though in more traditional RPGs. My goal is not the narrative. My goal is to accomplish actions  to accomplish goals that I through my character I want to accomplish. I want to beat the dragon  I want to solve the mystery  I want... To play my character is less like an actor playing a character  and more like a person on a sports team playing a position on the field.  To be Paladin Christian isn't to play the Character in the Story... It is to play Christian like one would a player on a computer sports game. An Avatar with skills and that might be more fun playing as ""Christian"" would... But also really with the same goals of stopping the other team from scoring  passing up to the midfielders  maybe moving forward at an opprotune time  not for drama but to win the game  and score a goal.  The thing is more joint narrative RPGs are more like improv working together with the drama as a goal. While in more traditional RPGs the goals are more that of the character. The drama is like the drama in sport  not a goal but an emergent outcome of the system. No one works towards the narrative of a sporting event  they work towards playing and winning the game.  That is immersion. There is no dissonance between the goals of the character at that point  and those of the player. There is no demand for story or drama  though we hope in a well defined sport it happens.  The problem for some others the abstraction. Look when I play FIFA on the playstation I am Lionel Messi  the abstraction of a computer game doesn't bother me. However for other  In a ttRPG  that abstraction is going to be a little more abstract. The goals might be the same  but the world will have less exactness. For actor people that can be a barrier to getting in character. To playing the Part in their play vs. there position in the game. I am not playing a sport  I am playing a mechanical game. That takes them out of it. They aren't Lionel Messi they are a computer game player and that's it.  Crunchy for one person  like me and maybe you  can be immersion. For others it can be that which doesn't pull them into the world  but mechanically out of the character. Especially when they want to act their character  not be them in the world  the game  beyond their control. Where the "
700,For me  HP or defense boosts go to the designated healer  and phys/mag attack goes to the phys/mag dps respectively. Except in some games where the main character does it all - in that case they just become a huge beefcake
701,For me  it depends. Usually if the RPG uses a well established setting  it makes that it's selling point and provides no interesting mechanics or new information on the world. There are exceptions  of course.  That's why I tend to enjoy original settings more  they are usually smaller and packed with useful information  and complement the system as well.  There is power in established settings  but another grudge I have with them is that they can turn into reference fest really quick. It's when DM tends to put as many references to the original work as possible  with no value to the story. Hell  officials products do that all the time too!
702,For me  when I was getting an anime  I was precisely in the right demographic to get into series like Black Butler and Hetalia. I knew the fan bases were toxic at the time  but I still generally enjoyed the series. But now that I've watched more anime and have different standards for what I consider to be good  I no longer find those series watchable or good. I actually find them highly problematic  and I think part of that is just growing up in general. I think I also found One Piece to be far more tolerable back then than I would if I tried to watch it again now. The character arcs in the beginning are solid  but there's far too much filler in between the arcs that actually contribute significant character development  and post time skip  it would seem that the characters just kind of stagnate and the arcs become even more boring and repetitive. I think I would have also dropped Fairy Tail far earlier than I actually did if I started watching it now.
703,For me in a very snowy area  there's no way I'm daily driving a RWD coupe through the winter. So if I want to drive a car year-round  it has to be FWD or AWD. I would still like a coupe  so FWD coupe it is.
704,For me it heighens the active consumation experience of media i like.  I don't keep a notebook though. When something hooks me  then i save it in my head for later. If i forgot it by then it wasn't important enough.
705,For me it was an 89 Honda Prelude  one my grandpa gave me for my first ever car. I love that car so much and its what I learned to drive stick on. I never really considered it much  but Ive had people come to me with offers and call it a classic now  so I suppose it must count for something!
706,For me its Dragon Quest. My absolute favorite RPGs lie between Dragon Quest  Pokemon  MOTHER (Earthbound)  Megani Tensei - I love a lot of Final Fantasy  but idk if I love it as much as a group as I do those  esp DQ. DQ is my top series and I could rave about it all day. Theres something I love in every entry  and the core of the gameplay is just wonderful.      EDIT: Adding in more western RPGS  Fallout is absolutely there (especially 1  2  New Vegas) as a group  I love Diablo. I want to say Elder Scrolls  idk if thats true as a group considering I never could get into the first 2  love Morrowind and Skyrim  and just like Oblivion. The Witcher is also up there.
707,For myself  I've always considered whether it's the player's skill and execution that matters  or the player character's to be the main defining trait. The more character skills is relied upon more than the player's  the more of an rpg it is.  It's a simple criteria  but imo quite effective at falling in expected genre lines.  Something like Dark Souls certainly has character stats and skills and such  but a good player can beat the game without leveling with no equipment and without even getting hit  making it much more of an action game with rpg elements. On the other side  something like Fallout  it doesn't matter how good at the game I am as a player  it's the character stats that define how _everything_ plays out  both in and out of battle. That's pretty firmly an rpg.   Everything else is more like identified traits of an rpg (levels  stats  etc  the stuff you mentioned)  but I think the separation of player and character skill is the core.
708,For older games  I honestly think Fallout 2 is the best of the bunch. Ridiculously vast campaign  lots of fantastic and weird characters  good stat and leveling system  compelling combat and compelling alternatives to combat.  Arcanum and Planescape: Torment are the most original conceptually  but both are rather dated  and as much as I love it Arcanum was always a better concept than a game. Fantastic soundtrack - its an original score performed by a string quartet.  For action-rpgs  my advice is boring: get diablo 3  play it for a while and figure out what you dont like. From there you can find a better game thats more specialized.  For more recent  everyone likes DOS2. I wasnt grabbed by it and never got far. But  the consensus is that its amazing. Sometimes the consensus is right.
709,For RPGs? You can't beat MMORPGs. FFXIV is my baby for when I just want to veg out  grind something  and watch a video or an episode of something on the side.   I've cleared many award winning TV series out of my backlog while playing FFXIV.  There's also RPGs that kind of play like an MMORPG  my favorite of these being Dragon Age: Inquisition.   Other than that  traditional JRPGs are a good bet. FFX  Dragon Quest X  Shin Megami Tensei  Persona  etc. They often have chunks of the game that are just grinding through encounters. You can pause the podcast for the story cutscene  and then go back to the podcast when you're back in grind mode. Turn-based combat also means you are in no rush to make your move  so it doesn't require split second decision making and a lot of your focus.  Games like Final Fantasy XII even play themselves if you set up all the Gambits (basically programming your NPCs to deal with fights on their own).
710,For San Diegans  would it be hypothetically possible to buy and register a Mexican GR Yaris and drive it around in the US?  Edit: I dont mean *importing* one  but just registering it in Mexico as a Mexican vehicle  but drive it around like Chula Vista/Otay Ranch/Eastlake area. I primarily ask because I have coworkers who live and commute from TJ. Also have a neighbor with a Renault
711,For solo RPGs you could look  at something like Ironsworn  A Woman in the Woods  Grandpa's Farm  Sweaters by Hedgehog  or The Tears of Cassandra - which though it makes \*your\* character a prophet  can be in an otherwise ordinary modern world.
712,For some strange reason  my computer wouldn't get the updates I needed to use Windows Sandbox. It said I had an error that wouldn't allow it to detect any new updates  so I checked to see if there was any corruption using cmd  did a Malwarebytes scan  and neither could detect any problems. I'm not too good with computers  so I tried fiddling around with the update options to see if I could do anything  and for some reason I turned off the setting that allowed updates to come in. I was just going to turn the setting on and off again  but the latter wouldn't work. And now every time I load up the advanced options  settings either takes a million years to work  or just seemingly freezes. Should I reset the whole computer  or is there something else I can try? Any help would be greatly appreciated.   &#x200B;  Note: My computer only becomes slow after I click Advanced Options in the Update & Security menu.
713,For some under the radar ideas:  - The third gen Subaru Forester (2009) was so good that the current one more or less uses the exact same design. The Japan only facelift finally shook things up and guess what it looks noticeably worse.   - The pre-facelift Mercedes AMG GT was incredibly simple and aggressive. Somehow less fiddly looking than its predecessor even. Its history of being used as a Formula 1 safety car will help it age even better.  - Maybe not timeless but I truly believe the day will come with the second generation smiley mazda(speed)3 will be loved as people get sick of angry designs for fun cars.   - The post facelift (2016) Tesla Model S will probably be remembered as the symbol of the companys golden era when they truly dominated the EV discussion. It might even be a generation defining car. I hope it is  at least  instead of the lumpy pieces of design sin that are the model 3  X  and Y.   - The Citroen C4 Cactus more or less ushered in a paradigm shift in crossover headlight design so that has to be worth something.  - The Porsche Taycan is a VERY strange design that has the potential to age incredibly well if they commit to it or be remembered as a visual monstrosity like the 928.
714,For the sake of uniqueness  Im going to try to stay away from performance cars and other enthusiast vehicles.  Designs that will age well:  * Kia Soul.  It was a boxy crossover long before that was cool  and even now  over 10 years after it first arrived  it still looks distinctive among mostly blob-like competition.  The fact Kia - who redesigns basically their entire lineup every 5 years - is leaving the Souls styling largely alone is testament that its already aged well  and as that type of styling becomes more popular  itll only age better.  * Retro-callback Mustangs.  Yes  that includes the Mach E along with the S197 and S550  and I want to talk Mach E specifically.  History will likely judge Fords naming decision harshly  but the Mach E is still a good-looking crossover  and the Mustang-esque body proportions (rear flares  roofline  long snout) also make it easy to identify among coupe-bodied CUVs.  As long as Ford continues to style Mustangs with those proportions and the tri-bar taillights  the Mach E will remain a callback to more iconic designs.  * Gen 3 Toyota 4Runner.  Its a rugged-looking and boxy SUV  a trend which will no doubt continue into future generations  but future ones will inevitably be given monster grilles that could swallow small cars whole.  They might still look good despite that  but that would lose a lot of the current trucks subtlety.  Designs that wont age well:  * Kia Telluride.  In stark contrast to the Soul  which went its own way from the rest of the segment  the Telluride is neither visionary nor unique in how it executes what should be a cool design concept.  Its like they took a Land Rover  ruined the proportions by chopping out half of the engine compartment  slapped on the side body panels from a Honda Pilot  then realized they needed to make the rear distinct  so they beat it until the dents formed a pattern they liked.  It almost makes me think the designers wanted something more like the Palisade  but marketing told them they needed to make it boxy to be more appealing  so they phoned this in.  * F-150 Lightning.  The fact it looks like a normal F-150 is appealing to people now  but the F-150 has looked basically the same for over 10 years now  and that design isnt aging particularly well if comments about P702 (the newest generation) being generic are any indication.  Thats not to say I think Ford shouldve gone to the other extreme and made a chromium-dipped Dorito on wheels  but people currently take note of the Lightnings styling only because its not trying to trumpet the fact its electric.  That will get boring very fast as manufacturers dial back the exaggerated-futurism styling on EVs.  * Hyundai Santa Cruz.  Its not a bad thing to be an adventure-oriented vehicle  but  save for missing a roof on the rear and some extra black cladding  the Santa Cruz doesnt look the part.  From the C pillar forwards  it looks exactly like a Tuscon.  Which is fine for now  but the moment design tr
715,For those that don't know  this is a prequel / set in the Pillars of Eternity games. I for one love those to death - of all the new CRPG wave I felt that it they have the most compelling writing by far.   Hopefully this is more POE and less Outer Worlds. I wouldn't mind sticking with the isometric perspective either  though it makes sense why they're going more cinematic.  I do feel that all RPGs of this type should be 3rd person  or 1st/3rd mix tho. That's a bit of a shame for me.  Edit: Also hope this is 'big party' based! Traveling with 6 people in your team really adds to the feeling of large scale adventure to me  moreso than 1-2 companions.
716,"For those wondering this is the same information as was linked in [this post](https://www.reddit.com/r/hardware/comments/prq5kz/nvidia_ampere_and_amd_rdna2_gpus_in/). The mods have removed it and said ""Please resubmit your post using the original source."" so here they are."
717,"Former wrench  turned Shop Foreman  turned Service Advisor  turned Service Manager/Director:  As a tech you didn't get paid as much on warranty work. If it's an issue that's difficult to replicate then someone is spending time with the vehicle nearly un-paid until it does it.  If it's something that wasnt obviously done wrong like a guy putting 22"" wheels on his M4 with a Big Brake kit saying the wheel bearing went bad... Yeah we would warranty it. Some people would try those JB4 Tunes "" untraceable"" until we send logs and see the car had +69 degrees of timing on 420psi of boost then we flag it and warranty is voided.  Service Advisors themselves make nearly anything unless it's a customer pay ticket depending on your payment plan. So they're the ones who will try to sell you on work that should be warranty. I have seen people pay for a timing belt then while still under the timing belt warranty the water pump goes out they will try to sell customer's that job before looking into the history to see if it's covered.  Myself  I'm a car guy. I have grown up around and under cars  and I have seen a lot of people get their ""head taken off"" by a salesman or service sales person. I liked being as honest and up front about stuff.  I'd call customers back saying I saw jobs in their history that cover components. If they had overlapping thinks like a valve cover gasket and ignition coils I'd only charge them for ignition coils.  When I became a Service Director keeping the guys up front in check was a big part of the job. It's not a job for everyone  having to translate mechanic  car parts  and basic needs to someone.   Telling a guy his Oil Filter Housing gasket is leaking oil on his drive belt that wore out his tensioner then threw the belt into the cooling fan and popped the belt into the front seal isn't ever easy. Explaining it when you find it leaking is the easy part."

720,French Coupes  Peugeot 406 or 407 coupes.  And the  Renault Aventime  Both look great  The Aventime a bit wacky. In the UK they are peanuts. In France good ones are sought after.   I've driven both. Avemtimes are wacky but very very comfortable. Especially for a 2dr.  The 406 has Ferrari Lines.   My number one favourite is the Laguna Coupe. That is a stunning car with DB7 lines. Nice to drive. They even did it with the 350z engine.   Great car but a hard sell.
721,From a narrative perspective  it fits well because its set up right from the beginning of the game. In general I think Pathfinder does a good job of making it feel earned. After all your character has to overcome a great deal before earning that title  and achieves far more in that time than most royalty ever did in the real world.   That being said  the Kingdom management stuff completely took the wind out of my sails  and I havent touched the game since I reached that point. Ill continue playing it again at some point  because up until then PKM was perhaps the best spiritual successor to Baldurs Gate Ive ever played  but like you I enjoy the idea of being a roaming adventurer far more than a baron who has to micromanage his keep. I know I can turn most of that stuff on autopilot  but it seems like Id simply be cheapening the experience by doing so.
722,"From an EE perspective  the later generation of processors support embedded USB debug  a.k.a.  another way to bypass everything on the software layers (BIOS  OS  applications) to get to your data. Previously  the only other way was to build special development boards that exposed the debug connector for ""deep"" OS and BIOS developers.  This mandate reeks of yet another intrusion into your devices/data. It just makes it easier for the authorities to access your data as all they need to know now is your processor's serial number  which unlocks the hardware debug (its a lookup table in the CPU manufacturer databases such as Qualcomm)."
723,From my experience  any British sports car falls into this category.   My TR6 is and always has been a questionable affair. Ive owned it since 1988friends always badger me about getting it back on the road but thats dubious at best.   I had a Spitfire Mk IV that was somewhat reliable - it never caught on fire at least - but the front pass wheel spindle broke when I was doing about 40mph and it felt like I was crash landing a plane as I went into the ditch. The electrical system was cobbled together something awful too.   My fathers girlfriend back in the 80s had an MGB - loves that car. She got a call one day at her office - it was on fire in the parking lot. She bought a TR7 nextkept it for a few years and traded it off on a Fiat X19 - and here I am bagging on Brit carsshe had the X19 for about a year. Bought it for $75-8500 new I think? Nothing but trouble and when she traded it in the trade in value was $1200she got an 86 300ZX and never looked back.   The thing about the British cars  save a few like the E Type Jag or the Austin Healy 3000 - never climbed in price the way many of its counterparts have and continue to do. My TR6 will never - no matter how perfect I could restore it - match the money a 240Z would bring.   But go figure. Mechanically they are dinosaurs AND they never had more than a niche market appeal.
724,From my favs list  Chrono trigger  Chrono cross  FF5 6 7 9  Baldurs gate 1 2  Icewind Dale 1 2  Jade empire  Super Mario Rpg  Tyranny  Neverwinter nights 1 2  Pillars of Eternity 1 2  Dragon Age Origins ult  Pathfinder kingmaker and wrath  Tales of (almost anything)  Disco Elysium  Earthbound (mother 2 and 3)  Daggerfall (unity version)  Morrowind (openMw)  Oblivion  Skyrim  Fallout 2 3 NV 4 (1 is good too just not as 2)  Arcanum steam works obscura  Septerra Core   There's more but my memory is stretched
725,From my understanding  there was an event held called 'breaking the bar' which was organised to try and get as many people on concurrently to break the previous record of around 13000. You can see talk about it on the half life subreddit. Sounds like a fun idea especially since steam wasn't tracking these stats back when hl2 was released (or making them public i dno.)
726,From reading that article  it looks like the grass case is actually the easy one as there is one 2d global grid of fire cells that handles all of the grass. Works well since if a heightmap is used for terrain it would be easy to look up the height at any given location.  Due to this  and with a fine enough grid  you could handle all grass fires using only one flammable component. In action you probably wouldn't notice the fire particles being offset a little bit from a single piece of grass. You could probably also pass the fire grid data into the grass shader to handle the grass turning black.
727,From the title  I thought you could load level 1134 and it would load the map from issue 1134 but your solution is much more reasonable scope.  Sharing level as PNG is very cool  but how do people distinguish maps from screenshots?  > you will have to use the following four colors (#2D1B2E  #574B67  #937AC5  #F9F4EA) .  Why is that? Technical limitation?   > use GitHub actions to automatically create new builds of my game whenever I push new code to the repo. I set this up early on in the game jam  Was this essentially copypaste from a previous project? I've only recently got into them  but found them easier to work with than Travis since you don't have two web services trying to talk to each other.
728,From Wikipedia:  [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intransitive\_dice](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intransitive_dice)  &#x200B;  The idea of these dices is pretty incredible (see the example. And see the story about Buffett and Gates). For a hobby that uses a lot of dice  I have never heard of a game that uses dice like this. Would be interesting to see one designed around the concept.
729,from your question my understanding is that you have a variable `lane` of type `float` and you want to access the value  but as a string.  this is called __*casting*__ a variable and can be done using the `c#` method `ToString()`.  ``` string lane_str = lane.ToString(); ```  the website [stackoverflow](https://stackoverflow.com/questions) is all about answering pure programming questions. i highly recommend checking them out!
730,Full Metal Panic is a good one that isn't recommended as often these days  it has 4 seasons with the second of them being a comedy spin off. It's not as dark as Eva but it's actually surprisingly violent  and some of it was made by Kyoani.
731,Full stack developer here using C#. Ive developed windows services  winforms  apis  discord bots  etc. I can create an api that communicates with a database that communicates with an angular site with minimal googles. But game development in C# bd in spending 95% of my time watching YouTube and googling.
732,Full thoughts [here.](https://fandemoniumnetwork.com/86-eighty-six-glad-to-be-here-review/)   This one really got me. Full of joy and happiness and then full of the same despair we're so used to seeing. This episode really showed that even though the 86 aren't separated by borders anymore they are still by people's attitudes. Nothing has changed for any of them really and it's so sad but I'm pretty sure they all knew it'd be like that.  Most importantly best boy Fido is back!!!!!
733,Fun fact  Cannon is the trim level  not the model name  which is Ute here in Australia. The base model is the GWM Ute Cannon.   The name is so poorly thought out my local dealer network has got it wrong on their billboards.
734,Funny  I've had a problem with this since I upgraded my laptop to Windows 10 from 7. 10 decides it wants to wake up at random times and check for updates/whatever the hell  and if I leave it in my bag for more than a week the battery is gone. I didn't have that problem with windows 7.
735,Funny you mention Wasteland 3. I just re-installed it today after putting maybe 5 hours into months and months ago. It was somewhat buggy at the time (PS5)  but I understand it should be better now. Plus I love turn-based combat (big XCOM fan).
736,Futaba is still reeling from that drunken question of why she wasn't envisioned as Takeda's wife...and that she chugged enough beers to need to throw up in the bathroom. Luckily Takeda's a good enough guy to take it all in stride.        Look at the chief playing wingman and letting Takeda and Futaba talk.         Well  Takeda wrote it off as just being the alcohol talking  and Futaba is too much of a tsundere to to be honest about her feelings  but I guess that gives them something to build from for their romance arc.         Poor Futaba's been flat all her life...even as her friends started developing their chests and she's had bigger-boobed friends all her life.        We meet Nanami  who Futaba's been friends with since middle school  and she's a busty  sporty  girl who draws a lot attention but is tough and confident enough to strut her stuff and not let pushy guys get to her. She's also great at arcades and teasing her friend about her love life.         Futaba once again wants cute things...that she then uses to pad her chest to make it look like she's got boobs. I can't say I saw that coming.        Kazama is a really good guy  making a call just to save Sakurai from a really pushy guy. And his kindness is enough to get Sakurai to actually ask him out for dinner  the first guy she's ever done it for in the office  and with the way Kazama is always paying attention to her it doesn't take much for him to say yes.         Jeez  Futaba wanted to be treated as a woman  but she didn't want some creep to take upskirt shots! Luckily Takeda is willing to risk his Judo Belt to catch the culprit and protect her.
737,"Futaba: ""I wish I could erase my memory""  Me: God  knows how many times I've thought of that exact same thing..  Kazama sees everything and he saves those who needs the saving..  P.S: Futaba holding Daikon pic is precious.."
738,FWD also gets better traction in bad weather  so those that live in snowy climates and have one daily driver may be willing to give up some theoretical performance to get better real world handling when needed
739,FWD coupe was usually lighter and more compact than it's four door counterpart. Plus  coupes looked better. See earlier Integras.    I couldn't care less about the practicality or space. If I wanted space or practicality  there are tons of other options out there.
740,FWIW this isn't a Dell thing  this is an Intel/Windows thing. Lenovo and HPs carry the same risk. I had a Lenovo kill itself this way back around 2016. One of my clients killed their HP this way about a year ago.  I mostly blame Windows.
741,Game dev is not hard. What makes it hard is your scope. You could code a simple cookie clicker in an afternoon. It's once you add achievements  quests  NPCs  AI  combat  etc that it gets really hard.  If you feel like you're hiring dead ends  reduce your scope over and over to an absolute minimal product until you feel like you can handle it  and then expand it.   You're not starting with mimicking entire Facebook if you were to build social media  are you? No  you'd create account management and simple post feed.
742,Game development highlights an under-reported issue with programming: the easy parts are the hard parts.   I recently did a Game Boy game that fakes a polygonal 3D tube by offsetting a table of polar coordinates. It has different physics when you deploy the spoiler on your jet-powered car  and at high enough speeds you can loop all the way around the tube  with the camera following you as obstacles scale up and whiz past. The framerate is frankly terrible  but the controls are a silky-smooth 60 Hz  because I double-buffer them with a vblank interrupt and then process batches of them in-between renders.   You know what gave me the most trouble? Pausing.   As a web dev you've undoubtedly seen this same bizarre ratio of complexity and difficulty. Banging out an anonymous Javascript function to dynamically add nested elements is a fun little puzzle. Vertically centering a button on them is witchcraft.
743,"Game loop (fighting scene in your case) is the most important to start with  but an ultra simple main menu is usually where I start. Something that just has a button that says ""Play Game""  that way if my game deals with spawning a player first I can develope that into my initial workload. But immediately after that it's straight to core gameplay loop!"
744,Game streaming I believe is the future  just no one's done it right. Just like how video game consoles were flopping until Nintendo released the NES. We just need the NES of game streaming to come out.
745,Game systems that aren't D&D are where you will find more flexibility and creativity since other systems allow for more abilities that aren't reliant on combat.  D&D: Twitch stream Threeflings on AngryNerdGirl or YouTube Threeflings channel Stars Without Number: Astronomica (podcast) Freeform Universal: Lakeshore & Limbo (podcast)
746,Gamedev will always be *challenging* but starting out  it can be mind flaying. As someone who went through that process  my biggest recommendation is to look into code architecture.  The hardest part of gamedev (outside of the specific challenges of your mechanics will throw at you) is that code  systems and assets are all tightly woven together and can quickly become a tangled knot.  Being able to separate mechanics  code and assets into cleanly defined sections that all communicate cleanly makes everything far more manageable. It allows you to know where to look for bug fixing  where to implement new requirements and opens you up to move things around more safely when your requirements change
747,Games with a grind work really well with this. Back when I played WoW I used to love to listen to stuff while I farmed or did dailies. I guess in the same vein other RPGs can have similar opportunities if you need to grind exp  mats  drops  etc. Also games where there's stretches of gameplay without story  like replaying some FE games you can do this pretty well (granted it depends on your ability to multitask and not leave a pegasus knight near an archer or in range of a ballista).
748,Gantt chart with the current features of your game forecast out to a launch date. Create hard milestone dates. IE playable proof of concept on 10/30  core  character model by 12/21. Etc etc. write out the pros vs  cons and score the difficulty of each feature.
749,GenCon is great but I'll bet most of those people are not local. Go to a local convention and find people you want to play with  then set up something local. That's what I did (after 40) and I quadrupled my gaming pool (at the least) by doing so.
750,General rule of thumb is coolant every 5 years and brake fluid every 2. But for regular driving you can easily leave the brake fluid in longer  just as long as there is no water or air in the abs system.
751,"Generally  I prefer to play in settings created by novelists or movie directors  than in settings created by game designers. They're just more inspiring and better written (in most cases).  The issue I have with some IP-inspired RPGs is not the setting  but the rules: in some cases it looks like it was a bad game who got published only because someone had bought the rights for the property  and wanted to use them somehow.  So I think that playing in ""proprietary"" settings is great  but that it might be better to do so using RPGs not officially tied to that franchise."
752,Genuine question: what would that even look like?   Like  how do you make a Metroid game open world. Like  is Axiom Verge and Hollow Knight open world metroidvanias? Do they mean something more like Zelda or Earthbound?   I feel like the greatest strength of Metroid and Metroidvania games is the tight level design. I dont really see how that would work in an Open World  which often has vast planes of nothing. Would it be more like the latest Tomb Raider games  where you explore the open world until you come across some tombs? Im not saying I wouldnt play that  but it sounds like a lot of work  and at the end of the day  doesnt really feel like it adds anything to the Metroid formula. Non-linear progression is already baked in  traversal is a key element of every game  I just dont see how adding an open world element heightens any of that.
753,German here:   I would have welcomed a speed limit but not at~130km/h as our neighbouring states. 160 or 180 km/h would have been a fair compromise.  Traveling in Switzerland and Austria is far more relaxed  even the Autobahnen (highways) and streets in general are better. In addition statistical calculations have shown a positive affect in reducing road deaths.  Edit: downvoted by people who have never been to any of the countries mentioned and who have absolutely know clue how the situation around the Autobahn is nowadays.
754,Germany already had sections of the autobahn with no speed limit. It used to be the proving ground for a top speed test after we came back from a weekend at the Ring..  Is this suggesting ALL of the autobahn is now likely to be limitless
755,Germany had elections about a month ago  as some of you might have noticed. Some of the political parties demanded a general speed limit of 130km/h (ca. 80 mph) on the Autobahn.  There have been coalition talks between three parties. Two of those demanded said speed limit.  Today they published an interim result. It includes NOT having a speed limit. (It explicitly says that) There is still a probability that will change  but it seems less likely now.  Personally I am very pleased with that decision.
756,Get a Rav4 and pay it off... don't do the fun '92 eclipse GSX and don't go mod crazy with a fully built motor and basically an entire car that is no longer in any way stock at all (but it was good times).
757,Getting an internship in a silicon design house that does GPU design.  Sorry for short answer. It's Friday. Been a tough week designing chips and things are still underwater as it always is right up to tape-in. Huuuu....
758,Ghost in the Shell + GITS: Stand Alone Complex is a classic and a must watch for sci fi anime.  Code Geass also features mechas if you haven't already watched it. Didn't like it much personally but it's popular.
759,Ghost of Tsushima and Assassins Creed Valhalla would perfectly tick all your boxes  They also both came out in 2020  so they still look amazing. But they are hardly obscure...  Gothic 1-3  Vampire The Masquerade and Sacred Gold are some I can think of. Saints Row The Third (Remastered) is more of a GTA clone but nice enough.  Well  and of couse FromSoftware and various Souls-like but I'm not sure whether that's your cup of tea.   Do you like JRPGs and/or CRPGs as well? There's tons of open world and stuff to do to be had there.
760,"Github and Gitlab both do markdown. Markdown is easy.  Gitlab also does Asciidoc. Asciidoc is powerful. Honestly  it's not really much harder than markdown  but is far more suitable for authoring books. (Github also does Asciidoc  but they  have yet to implement ""includes"" (templates) properly  which makes them an undesirable choice for Asciidoc hosting.)  The benefit from using a code-hosting site over something like Kanka  Obsidian Portal  or World Anvil is that other people can contribute to your world  yet you still have control over what is actually merged in.  The downside is that you have to learn to use the tools. (""The tools"" being  a marginal familiarity with git and a passing familiarity with Asciidoc or Markdown.) But that's true of Kanka  Obsidian Portal  and World Anvil as well  and *honestly the learning curve is shallower* for the coding sites."
761,Given current emissions levels  and the trajectory we're currently on to decrease them  we're highly likely to see 2m of sea level rise by 2050...  Edit: Not sure if the downvotes are climate deniers or what  but here's a source if it's just because I didn't backup the claim: https://www.forbes.com/sites/jimdobson/2019/10/30/shocking-new-maps-show-how-sea-level-rise-will-destroy-coastal-cities-by-2050/  (That source low balls the temperature rise considerably btw)
762,Giving phase spiders phase webs. You walk into a room  maybe you're even on alert for enemies  then BAM! Webs phase in all around you. You're hopelessly stuck. You can even give 'em a round to panic before the spider appears.
763,Glad to have gotten a notification from EVGA and getting a 3060ti but damn $100 over founders edition pricing is rough.  As more 10 series cards start going belly up it's going to only get worse. $1500 for a halo product is NOT normal. If a video card can't be purchased at a good $200 - $300 price point then this might be a real death knell for PC gaming. Who'd think it wasn't a console or lack of interest by developers but a crypto currency.  Heck if Intel and AMD could offer an integrated graphics with a semi decent playability that would help band aid the issue until it can be addressed.   Retailers will still want to charge exorbitant prices even when the chip shortage is over. They have had a taste of fat profits and surely want to keep it. With Ethereum going to proof of state rather than proof of work  this will help. But ultimately TSMC  Samsung and Intel need to spin up newer factories to keep up with demand.   All in all once the US government and Europe will ultimately want a piece of that fat digital pie. One thing the government wants and good at doing is starting wars and collecting taxes. Nothing would make the fed and finance industry more uncomfortable than a currency and asset that can't be regulated  controlled by their own hand.  Regulations are surely on the horizon because the government's of the at least the EU and the Us really want their sweet tax revenue.   Ultimately until proof of stake  regulations and more factories come online this will be GPU purgatory hell for gamers and paradise profit for miners  scalpers  board partners and retailers.
764,Glad to see the PPI didn't decrease with the larger screen. Hopefully it includes a larger battery too. I love my 2018 Paperwhite  but even with the LEDs off for all its features it has a worse battery life than my old 2012 Kindle Touch. On the Touch it was an afterthought to charge the batt occasionally during the month  but with the Paperwhite I have to make sure to do it every other week  and weekly if using high brightness settings.   In addition to a larger battery how about unlocking the setting to finally change the sleep timer  and epub support would be nice. Calibre is great but it is not perfect.
765,GM is the only company that makes proper forged upper control arms for 2003+ panthers  and theyre only 40 a pop. I usually go ACDelco or Motorcraft on my car if applicable  but I find it hilarious Ford doesnt make some parts for vics but GM does and theyre better than everything else.
766,Go back to 2015 and tell my self don't settle for the SUV enjoy something sporty and learn manual. I still don't know how to drive manual and I want to but you can't find a cheap decent manual car for shit
767,Go fuck yourself Nintendo. There arent enough worthwhile 64 and Genesis games to make this worth paying more for. I have also been emulating them for well over a decade now and they look better than the Switch is capable of.
768,Go to bed early the night before and get a good sleep.  Take a small cooler with snacks and water. Take a foldable lawn chair. Make sure your helmet is acceptable for the event.  Usually an SA Snell rating is required  and most tracks are still OK with SA2010  however some have now moved up to SA2015. Be punctual and pay attention either at a drivers meeting/or classroom session. Make sure you understand the flags and track etiquette for passing etc. If you aren't sure about something  please just ask  don't assume.   Make sure you have high temp brake fluid  even though you might have a sporty car  chances are good it's not equipped with high temp brake fluid from the factory. I drive a ZL1 1LE with amazing brakes  but it comes with DOT 3 from the factory  and you can easily boil it at a track day. Make sure your tires are at least 50 percent tread left and that your brakes are more like 75 percent left. Watch footage of a similar car turning laps at whatever track you are attending (youtube vids are great). Familiarize yourself with the track layout.   Most importantly  have fun and make sure to leave with your car in the same condition it arrived. Track days aren't a competition  they are there to have a great time on track  make some memories and to meet like minded car folk.
769,Go to Optimise and defrag disks. Turn off auto analyser on disk optimisation  untick run on a schedule and it will drop dramatically  you can manually run optimisation any time you want.   Windows really is geared towards SSD drives now  unfortunately microsoft doesn't seem to realise there are literally millions of machines in use still running mechanical HDD
770,Go to race yourself and not to race others.  Don't try to overtake people with hard braking but only on the straight.  Read your insurance contract to understand what they cover and what not. Mine for example covers track driving unless lap times are taken.
771,Go with a straight pipe  it will be a little bit louder but will certainly not wake your neighbors up. The super loud cars that you hear that are often referred to as straight piped are so loud because they delete all resonators and mufflers in addition to the cat
772,"Goblin Crafted has a [page dedicated to Kids RPGs](https://goblincrafted.com/recommendations/genre/Kids/).  They look at ...  * Hero Kids (D&D for kids) * Amazing Tales (a generic RPG for young children) * Do: Pilgrims of the flying temple (a game about young ""pilgrims"" helping others in a Super Mario Galaxies-like universe of small planets) * the Labyrinth ""Adventure Game"" (a simple RPG based on the Jim Henson movie) * Mouse Guard (an adult RPG based on a kids comic book  that many parents have successfully run for their children)  If any of those sound interesting  check out the site for a more detailed look at each one (including rules summaries  price comparisons between vendors  etc."
773,Going to echo the people asking what Awakening and Fates are doing on this poll  and preferring one of the unlocalized titles to be remade for localization before *any* of these.  I also agree with the person saying that Path of Radiance and Radiant Dawn should be bundled if they get a remake.
774,Golf Alltrack or Golf sportwagen 4motion with a 6 speed.  4wd manual golfs are *always* appreciated in the decades to come just by the drivetrain alone  and these two are handsome wagons on top of that.
775,Good for them! This looks to be about half of Paizo's staff  just going by the names put forward publicly in the twitter thread. Easily enough people and with enough clout to be able to threaten a strike if it ever came to that.  Hoping that good faith negotiations go underway and that Paizo is able to buck the trend of RPG companies paying peanuts to its writers  developers  artists  and support staff. I do worry exactly how much money there is to go around... but that's not really for me to know or speculate on. I hope this is a step that leads to better working conditions for Paizo staff--and for all the other small and medium RPG companies right now.  It's a bold step  and bold steps give me some hope.
776,Good luck to them. With the industry moving more and more toward a contractors-only model (much like other industries in the US  at least) it's hard to say at this point just how much leverage they've got  or whether Paizo management is prepared to go that far.  One other thing (this might be an unpopular opinion  but it needs to be said): higher wages  especially for American workers  probably means higher costs to you. While it would be nice if the bosses went in to their end  there's a good chance that a) won't happen and b) wouldn't get it done if they did. If you want to support American workers having fair pay and fair conditions  support them with your dollars and not just well-wishes on social media.  TL/DR: hopefully this works  but if you say you support Paizo workers but won't pay more / at all for the products they produce  you're kidding yourself. Support American workers by buying American  from retailers and distributors who aren't gangsters like Amazon  even if it costs a little more.
777,Good news I guess... Probably European automakers are lining up for this. Will still take some time to boot up production so this won't really make any dent in the global shortage for another year or so.
778,Good preparation is important. DOT4 brake fluid is a must. You might be able to get away with street brake pads depending on how much horsepower/weight you have  the length of straights and your skill level(faster driver more likely to overheat brakes)  but I would recommend just getting some track pads. Overheat your brakes and the only skid marks will be in the seat of your pants.  Summer tires are less likely to overheat and chunk out  but you can get away with all seasons if you dont have the money to spend right now. My recommendation would be a second set of wheels with summer tires for the track combined with a square tire set up(same size front and rear wheels / tires) so you can rotate front to back. Most tracks are clockwise and you will destroy your front left tire. You can get quite a bit more tire life by rotating front to back in between track events.  If you want to maximize your tire life  get an alignment with as much front camber as your hardware will allow. Something like -3.5 front and -2.5 rear is a good start for RWD. Stock hardware may be limited to like -1.5 front. Anything you can get will help not destroy the outside edge of front tires going around corners.  Tighten your lug nuts before first session. Do not remove wheels or tighten them back up while hot. Its a good way to break/seize studs.  Brakes will be hot when you come off track. Try not to stay still with the brakes applied. Best to use a wheel stop or leave it in gear to keep your car from rolling instead of applying park brake.  Check your tires pressures immediately when you get off track and let some air out as needed to even things out. You will probably find your front tires way over pressure  particularly front left. Tires have a little triangle on sidewall pointing to the edge of your tread. If your tire wear after a session doesnt reach the tip of the triangle  you have too much tire pressure. If your wear goes beyond the tip of the triangle onto the sidewall  you dont have enough pressure.  NASA Great Lakes events are kind of expensive  but they have really good instruction. Swallow your ego and pay attention during the classroom portions. How much you get out of it depends on your attitude going in and willingness to learn. Highly recommend.  On track tips:  You will have sensory overload and feel overwhelmed for at least the first session of first day. Especially if you drive a manual car  there is a lot of speed coming into corners and there is a lot multitasking that you need to do. Brake  heel-toe downshift  find your turn in point etc. Brake early and try to relax the best you can. No shame in being slow as you learn. Focus on taking the right line and being smooth  not being fast. Fast will come with naturally if you practice good mechanics.  Do all your braking in a straight line. Dont go flat on throttle until your steering wheel is straight.  Check your mirrors at start  middle and end of each passing straight to see if you need to point
779,Good to see you're enjoying yours as much as my Grandma enjoys hers  though hers is a [different colour](https://i.imgur.com/5diJUHm.jpg)  looks [great](https://i.imgur.com/mDOJMn1.jpg). Very quiet ride as you say.
780,Good video  forgot that AMD GPUs will run with this thing  which is crazy  non-x86 is getting more and more usable every day  I would be surprised if even the *next* generation of consoles is still running on x86. RISC-V would be cool  but ARM is fine as well.
781,Good.  Speed limits are arbitrary and different drivers and vehicles are capable of safely moving at various speeds depending on conditions.  This is the direction that every country/state should be moving toward.
782,Good. Make an udemy course about the engine you like the most (unreal  unity or Godot. I suggest Godot). So you will learn and usually the instructors there answer messages and questions so you can use them to mentor you.  When the course is done  you will know how to do what you want. then you can start with game design to see what you need to do  and game dev to do the things you designed.
783,Google tire size calculator  The outer circumference of the tire effects the odometer and speedometer.   Shame of me  but as soon as I need new tires I go up a size  slows the odometer and fills the wheel housing a bit more. Generally won't rub.
784,Gorgeous board  my only gripe from this initial look is it doesn't look like there's a dual BIOS switch  this used to be a standard feature for Gigabyte and can come in so handy  especially for newer platforms.
785,Gotta do the Mass Effect sequels (both of them.  There are two sequels to Mass Effect.  Not three. Two.  That's all there were.)  I personally quite loved Fallout 4 as well.  Still play it  a couple thousand hours in.
786,Gotta get out to an event and meet some folks. Unfortunately people do judge a book by its cover and assume that they may not relate. I met a couple of 50+ year old guys at a larp last night and had an amazing time. They were great roleplayers  hilarious and good sports. Opened my eyes a bit personally  not that I ever discriminate against anyone for any reason. (Unless you're a piece of shit)  I think that an older more experienced dm or player would be amazing but unfortunately most of the people I know who are a bit older are not interested in this stuff at all.
787,Great !! Now im not paid full price core i9 and just wait some genius in china modified the mobile core i9 to LGA lol  Still waiting my new project using core i9 BGA to LGA chip come from Aliexpress paid just 170$
788,"Great article u/andreif!  Just thinking out loud  IMO this sensor should not be called a 201.3MP native sensor  Since the 201.3MP resolution is achieved using software/remosaic algorithms  describing it as native is very misleading IMO  IMO 12.5MP is a more accurate ""native"" resolution since that's how the CFA is physically arranged (although native still isn't really the right word either)  But Samsung would disagree with me since they want to market it as 200MP  Maybe the best option would be that there's no native resolution  since all modes require either binning or software/remosaic algorithms  12.5MP is the 4x4 binned resolution  50MP is the 2x2 binned resolution and 200MP is the remosaic resolution"
789,Great article. I parsed a couple of pieces of information that may be useful to you. (or not! lol)  The 2d grid/array is generated WHEN the grass is hit by fire. So no grid before the fire comes out. Thus the grass don't have an HP until they are hit by fire in order to save memory. (See   'lazy evaluation')  the grass doesn't catch fire till it hits 0 hp. The amount of damage it takes beyond 0 determines the maximum number of tiles it can catch fire  thus limiting the propogation.   So using my pseudo numbers. You damage a tile for 500 damage. 50 points goes to the tile caught fire. That leaves 450 to propogate onto neighboring tiles  so 9 additional tiles will also catch fire. These 450 points of damage will not be consumed instantly  but each game cycle the neighboring tiles will take damage until they catch fire until all points of damage are exhausted. The direction of this fire etc. can be determined/affected by wind etc. using a simple 'dot product'.  This limits the total damage to 9 tiles  but allows the fire to spread naturally to those tiles over time.  That is basically how I understood it.
790,great episode  one of those that honestly felt like it was like 5-10 minutes and not 22 minutes.  i noticed the beast people (or atleast the chieftain) share the last name with Ghislaine  so i'm guessing he/they are either immediate family or the same clan(?) as her.  the monkey man turned out to be a lot better person than i initially expected when he first showed up.  Glad they could have the kids aswell as clear up the whole situation and have now befriended the villagers.  and man it was rough watching that last scene when Eris right before said she couldn't wait to meet him again...
791,Great read  I think a lot of people on here would benefit from reading this.   Agree with everything except  >Pick your dev tools  language  engine once. NEVER change them  He's right to criticize the extreme of jumping from one thing to another non-stop  but when he mentions never upgrading your dev environment or tech stack  well that sounds just as extreme  and just as flawed.
792,Great review my man. There need to be more car reviews from a non-US perspective here imo.  Also  did your guys get active safety features on the Outlander  or are they cut entirely? In my country features like AEB and lane keep assist are only present on the top trim model  which is a huge bummer. Heck not even curtain airbags are standard.
793,Great review.   Im going to miss the cup holder area of my 10th generation Civic  you can fit any size bottle in there even an insulated 40 oz water bottle.   I cant wait to get this in sonic gray pearl  I hope they start using that color in other trims like the EX-L.
794,Great update  but I still think the Galaxy Fold is the superior solution for the vast majority of people. With the Fold I could choose to put apps side-by-side  but on the Duo  I can never have once massive tablet-like display.
795,Greetings everyone!

796,Greetings! My name is Jinxie and I am looking for a free MMO-RPG where I can swap to first person view  and also I can download on MacBook. I wanted to download Skyrim  but it costs money so I am looking for free alternatives. Thank you guys and have a good day!
797,Grin dawn is your answer 9 main classes. 45 combined classes . At least 8 different dmg type builds. Constellation points. Deep lore and hours upon hours of replaybility . Tho character customization is the only thing it lacks it only has male or female and thats that but its pros are so mich that you wont even care .
798,Gubermint is bad and besides my fav brand [knows whats best for me](https://m.soundcloud.com/citationsneeded/143-how-silicon-valley-uses-hollow-anti-racist-posturing-to-sell-its-exploitative-business-model) thank you very much.
799,Gus practically spitting bars with the triple casting.   Will mentioned how the spear being able to change size makes it easier to carry but that could also be useful in combat by catching the opponent off-guard.   Will seems so emotionally immature right now but it makes sense considering his age. He doesn't tell Blood and Mary about Gus attacking him in the dungeon because Gus avoids the subject yet gets mad at him for being secretive about wanting him to throw the fight against Blood.
800,Guys I respect your opinions on our glorious Autobahn  but let me state  it is not as nice as everyone makes it out to be. Most stretches already have speed limits  and the rest is likely in bad condition or under construction. So the stretches you can plant your foot down are quite few and far between and more often than not short.  Sure German driving discipline is way beyond the average American  but we have cases like that here too.  As someone who has to commute via Autobahn daily I see a lot of idiots that don't manage to check their blind spots  don't indicate lane changes  sit forever in the middle lane at 100kph with the next truck barely in viewing range (Mittelspurschleicher)  or don't even manage to accelerate properly when they get onto the Autobahn and act surprised/angry when the truck doesn't make space for them to merge... We also have those morons that need to compensate by pass you with 200+ kph in a 100kph zone or tailgating and brake checking once you can move over to let them pass...  I mean sure I like to drive 200+ kph every once in a while and I'm happy that the general speed limit is most likely off the table.
801,Had a lot of fun reading this book. Doesnt take itself seriously at all and is just an all-around fun system for making a game focused on the intersection of romance and action. Its not even strictly queer necessarily; I cant think of a better system for simulating  for instance  the mid-combat wedding of Will and Elizabeth in Pirates of the Caribbean. The take they have on strings (from Monsterhearts originally) is engaging and can definitely be ported into other narrative systems. The focus on romance without making things weird is what makes it work  imo. The Queerz game thats funding on Kickstarter right now is less appealing to me because the focus is so on fighting the evil system with gayness which is just kind of exhausting (though the system itself seems cool). Its more fun when youre supposed to be kind of smitten with the people youre fighting. Would love to run a game with my friends sometime (and indeed I would recommend only playing with friends or people youre really comfortable with).
802,Had been dealing with this nonsense the last two weeks on my brand new Vostro. Got hot enough when the lid was closed to cook an egg  its absurd.  Luckily it was easy to fix  after many hours of frustration trying to make this new S0 connected standby mode work in a non stupid way I just re-enabled S3 standby and its been great. Open an elevated cmd window and enter:  Powercfg /a  If it says S3 is not supported you are SOL but if it says unavailable when S0 enabled just paste this registry key in  hit enter  reboot  and voila problem fixed back to good old properly working sleep mode when closing the lid.   reg add HKLM\System\CurrentControlSet\Control\Power /v PlatformAoAcOverride /t REG_DWORD /d 0
803,"Had no choice. Timing chain went  fuel line rusted out. Literally had 2 mechanics look at it and was told ""The cost of a new engine would be close to what you could get a slightly newer car with. It's not worth it"". So I had to junk it. If your car is fine and you don't want to let it go  don't. Especially if you're going to finance whatever you buy next."
804,Had some thing similar happen recently. Replacing the CMOS battery (usually a 2032) fixed it for me. If you don't have a replacement on hand  disconnect the power then remove and reinstall the battery to reset the BIOS settings that may have been corrupted.
805,Had this happen with my first build. I cant remember exactly what they are called but whichever cables give power to my case (I think. They are the cables that say power  have a + and - on them etc..) but either way  I simply had the bottom row of those connectors plugged in upside down. The thing was doing exactly what yours was until I flipped those around and everything worked like a charm. Silly mistake but maybe it could help!
806,Had two chances (sort of) but failed both times.  First was in high school when I first got my license. I begged and pleaded with my parents to buy me a Mk4 Supra. Naturally they declined and got me a used Accord instead. I still joke with them that if theyd gotten me the Supra  it could be worth nearly double.  Second was the Z4 M Coupe. Almost pulled the trigger on one around 2009. Decided against it because I was working long hours in Manhattan with very little time to drive. Last I checked these cars are selling used for as much if not more than what they sold for new back then.
807,Haha  it's an almost decade old Playstation 3 / Xbox 360 game. It's honestly more interesting that it doesn't run like that on the PS4 already. Next big news story: The Elder Scrolls V: Skyrim will be patched to run at 4k/60!
808,"HA-HA!!! Almost got me!   Wow you think you're slick  but  no. I'm not doing your homework for you.  You had a great guy on staff  but you kicked him to the curb and stole his stuff. And what do you have from it? A failed ""zombie"" cash grab and pachinko machines?  If you submit to this contest  good luck to you. But  don't be surprised I'd some of the games losers submitted mysteriously comes out..."
809,Hahahahahah laughs in game dev  I swear to god though in 5+ years of game dev now its still hard at times but you just know what to expect more.  My rule of thumb is to add a week onto any time estimates  shit will just come up that you dont expect. Doubling the amount of coins you earn per level? Cool now the animations a broken  lets figure out why?
810,half does exist  but we need more info. Are you using GLSL or HLSL?  If HLSL  this page might explain a few things: https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/win32/direct3dhlsl/dx-graphics-hlsl-scalar  > half - 16-bit floating point value. This data type is provided only for language compatibility. Direct3D 10 shader targets map all half data types to float data types. A half data type cannot be used on a uniform global variable (use the /Gec flag if this functionality is desired).  You will likely need to use a minimum specific shader model version in order to get 16bit float ALU (sm6.2 maybe?).
811,"Halloween and by extension horror gaming  is one of my favorite things in this world. Don't get me wrong  I like the Tolkienisms I get from games from time to time  but *I* really enjoy my horror. I mainly play Call of Cthulhu for this  it's one of the few systems I think can nail that aspect.  Usually I avoid D&D... until now.  &#x200B;  It's hard ya know? In a high magic setting where someone can just cast a heal spell or blow up a zombie with a radiant strike that getting that ""horror"" feeling isn't the easiest. I think Curse of Strahd did a decent job at least trying.  &#x200B;  However this 1 shot I got from PB Publishing ""The Haunt 2"" really got myself and my players at the table sufficiently creeped out. Not because of huge overpowered monsters  but because of ambience and a narrative that actually makes you creeped out and not just yawning at the table (as some jaded players do  myself included).  &#x200B;  The Haunt 2 by PB Publishing is probably my new favorite D&D 5E horror games  and you can [see my full review here.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k0f3SzX_3mA)   &#x200B;  For those who want to play a horror game  and have little time to prep  The Haunt 2 is a great dungeon crawl that also makes your skin crawl.  &#x200B;  DM's Guild Page : [https://www.dmsguild.com/product/253875/The-Haunt-2](https://www.dmsguild.com/product/253875/The-Haunt-2)"
812,Halo infinite just did their first tech preview a few weeks ago and had no NDA of any kinda and said that the content was free to share and stream. Definitely makes me more hesitant on a game that comes out soon where they wont even let you show people how it plays..
813,hands down my favorite JRPG series is Trails of Cold Steel 1-4  with Cold Steel 3 being my absolute favorite JRPG of all time. I love the combat  I love the story  I love the music  I love the characters  I love everything about what Cold Steel is. Its very dopey and cheesey anime with a lot of tropes from anime in it and it could easily just have been an anime from like 2011 but I think its really awesome and I love it. I'm also really liking Hajimari No Kiseki which is the newest entry in the trails series  in 2023 it will be localized as Trails into Reverie and im excited to play that although i'm going to finish the japanese version first and then experience the story in english. I'm also really excited for the game after Hajimari called Kuro No Kiseki which will also be localized around 2023-24 but is releasing in japanese in about 2-3 days. not sure if i will play that considering there may not be a fan translation for it
814,Happened to me with my work laptop  I used to always put the old one on sleep during weekdays. With the new one  the first evening I got home  I noticed the bag was warm  the fan was even spinning while in sleep mode...
815,Hard to say based off such a brief description. There are a lot of different factors that play into what consumers deem a game to be worth. One of them would be the quality of textures  models and shaders  basically meaning how good the game looks compared to others in the same genre. Another thing would be how fun it is to play compared to others in the genre. If there's any kind of story with voice acting and cutscenes  that would also influence the price. A game that has none of that would likely be considered to be worth less than one that does. Finally  the length of the game is also important to many people. Some even say they want something like an hour of gameplay per dollar they spent.  Basically  it's very hard to judge what an appropriate price would be without knowing what your game is like  and how much money and time you spent making it. Your best bet is to compare your game to similar games and see how they're priced and make your descision based off that.
816,Hard to say for an RPG....most have stories you need to pay attention to. I guess an ARPG would be the best for this. Here is a list below:  Grim Dawn  Last Epoch  Wolcen  Chronicon  Diablo III/II Resurrected  Torchlight 1/2/3
817,Hard to say. Is this your first game?   I think first thing is probably to understand why over scoping is a problem. If we over scope  the game takes to long to make  which will probably lead to either financial loss or we simply get tired of it and never finish the game.   So to avoid that I would define a deadline for the game. Define how long you want to take to make this game. Let's say you want to make and release a game in one month. That probably means your game must be finished in two weeks. And the rest of the two weeks will be spend on marketing  uploading to your desired platform  get capsule images ready  write description texts etc.   In the end estimating how long things will take is probably a matter of experience. My advice for anybody is make a couple of small games to get some experience.

819,Has anyone here extended the range on their key fob by adding antenna http://imgur.com/a/3ETFttl I've been trying to sand down this resin (I think thats what it is) but even using 80 grit sand paper not having much progress. https://www.8thcivic.com/threads/how-to-extend-your-keyfob-range-properly.236373/ this is the guide I am following. Any help would be very appreciated atm my fob gets about 20 steps of range with nothing blocking the signal and drastically drops with interference.
820,Has she ever played Animal Crossing or Stardew Valley? If she did  and enjoyed them  I have a recommendation for her. It's called Cozy Town. It's like a farming Sim video game  but as an RPG. Can be played solo or as a group.  https://temporalhiccup.itch.io/cozy-town
821,Have a HP Pro A g2 cpu  was looking for a monitor but came across a term called 'adaptive syncing'. No idea what it is but someone recommended me to check out for this. No GPU  just on Vega 11 graphics. Can anyone help me out whether or not I should look for monitors with this ?
822,Have same motherboard and cpu in the garage just lying there with no use together with 16gb ram. Best cpu I've had  no issues at all. 2600K running at 5.0ghz for 10 years. Probably would have ran another 10 years.
823,Have the ghost set fire to something. In the room there's a small fire extinguisher. When the players use it to put out the fire  the chemical powder fog in the air outlines the ghost standing by watching the mayhem. Normal small extinguishers can last as little as 8 to 10 seconds. They use half of it putting out the fire. Only enough for 4 to 5 more quick bursts of chemical powder.
824,"Have to disagree with the standard advice of ""start small""  although I understand and empathize with why people suggest this.   Start as big as you want to start  start with something you think you'll love doing. Fail early and fail often. Delete the project and start over--see how quickly you can get back to where you where before (and pay attention to how much more organized/efficient your programming and project management has become).   Making twelve different versions of pong might be an accomplishment of sorts  but is it something you'll really be proud of? Will making pong motivate you to push yourself forward?   Remember that in any creative industry the most common advice you will hear is handed out by people who are just as frustrated as you  and who haven't accomplished much more than you have.   Think about that when you ask for perspective. Again it doesn't mean it's all bad advice  but the context in which you're being given that advice is important to keep in the back of your mind."
825,Have you considered exploring newer games with older philosophies? The old-school revival / renaissance movement might be a good comprimise between connecting with exploring current popular games and keeping the same rule structure or gameplay that you enjoy.  There's a community over at r/osr that might be able to point you in the right direction.
826,Have you ever heard the name of a city  town  or village and think to yourself That would make a good name for a fictional city in an RPG video game? City size doesnt matter; it can be any size  from Hong Kong or NYC to your nearest little podunk town most people have never heard of  or anywhere in between.  Im looking for an IRL place name that could pass as a fictional town in a role-playing video game.
827,Have you ever sat on the rich Corinthian leather of a late 80's Chrysler LeBaron? Beautiful seats  craptastic plastic dash. Glorious plastic fake wood every where. K car. Did I mention the luxurious seats? Like sitting on a leather sofa in an Italian men's club.
828,Have you tried a lot of different games and it's the same?  In that case  i would say too much games  it might be goid to try something else or new hobbies and try to Come back another time.  Sometimes i just can't play  i don't feel connected.
829,Have you tried running games that are designed to not require preparation? If the game specifically tells you not to prepare  will you still think of things to watch for inspiration?  Have you tried seeking out media you really dont want to be inspired by? Something dreadfully dumb  just to break the habit?  Have you tried trusting your ability to come up with and/or recall ideas? You dont have to write everything down all the time. If youve had an idea  its very likely to return  and if it doesnt  trust that youll think of something equal or better instead. And if you know youve forgotten something cool  dont try to remember it  just return to the environment you were in when you first had the idea  that will usually trigger the memory. (Snufkin taught me to be chill about ideas. He lost a melody once  but he just went about his business  or lack thereof  and eventually the melody returned of its own accord.)
830,Have you tried running the 'faulty' card alone with each of the connecters in turn and in the different slots(those occupied by working cards)? If it doesn't work with any of the connectors I would hazard a guess that it's rooted.
831,Have you tried something simpler to get yourself off the ground? Try a simple game engine like gamemaker studio  or godot  or a javscript web engine.  Make a simple 2d game from a tutorial and build from there.
832,Haven't played Pathfinder 2  but played Pathfinder Kingmaker after they added the turn based combat and I liked it a lot  well I liked the combat but not the realm layer part. I'm now starting Solasta (it's included in gamepass) and enjoying it  it's more D&D but a more 'rough' experience so far.
833,Havent seen Gundam yet. But Gurren Lagann is my third favorite anime of time. This coming from someone who all time favorite is Evangelion. But I will let you know that Gurren Lagann is the opposite of Evangelion in the sense that where Evangelion is a dark and complex show that deals with mature themes and topics and comparison to Gurren Lagann which is a really fun light hearted positive action show. Both very different each but both are awesome shows. Also fun fact Evangelion and Gurren lagann are done by the same studio so there that.
834,Having recently had the urge to run a game in a cyberpunk/technopunk setting  I'm shopping around for different systems that I could bring to my table. I'm not looking for anything in specific  since I don't really know any of the systems all that well. I know Shadowrun is the most popular (?) and I know Cyberpunk - the franchise - exists  though I have no clue if it's still in publishing aside from the CDPR game. Please  suggest and sell me on a system for my table!  &#x200B;  (For more information  I'm currently running a D&D5E  and have played in a MASKs game and that's about my extent of different systems  but I have players that are experienced in all kinds of systems - L5R  Shadowrun itself  one of the Star Wars tabletops (if there's multiple? idk) etc etc)
835,Having worked on a platform for story games  I completely can relate to the work that goes into it. In some ways the platform to generate content is a hook to get in a lot of people who just consume it.  Interactives is a really interesting spot  however  if you're talking for mobile games. It's a huge business and isn't the cheapest form of creative  so I'd love to see a link to your site and services in that regard.
836,He probably only got that afternoon slot as it was probably a press car. I doubt if they could give him the car at night or long enough to drive to some less congested portion of the autobahn. Complete fantasy car.
837,"Healer first  full tank second. I always played healer  support etc and one day I was playing Luna Online (I was level 10 at most  never played it thaf much) so I found this dude unkillable  I thought he was high level  i grouped with him and he said ""it's better to kill slowly and not dying  than to kill quickly and spend all your resources getting healed"". (This idea) Since then  I play tanks when it's a single player  single character game. Healers and supports just fits my personality i guess. In a war or battle it always necessary someone to be auxiliary  to be away of the actual fight to watch and still contributing  to be the eyes while helping someone in the heat of the battle  to be the great assistance in that awesome goal  to be a stage for others. The idea is so fucking cool. It's like being Ganso when Neymar played in Santos. Ganso made Neymar. Without Ganso  maybe neymar wouldn't take all the advantage of his opportunity. Ganso created for neymar. Ganso may not be so famous today  but he was the best support."
838,Healers  It's always comforting to know that when shit gets real there will always be someone who can help you recover so you can keep fighting. I also don't like using health restoration items unless I really have to  I'd much rather just use healing magic. Also they get bonus points if they have the ability to buff/debuff as well
839,Heaps on the wiki here: https://www.reddit.com/r/rpg/wiki/kidrpgs  There'll be many  many options open to a 9yo  a bit less for a 7yo  and fewer again for something that suits both.  What media do they enjoy?
840,Heavens Lost Property    It was the second anime I watched after FMA. I dont know why it was my second  I just saw it recommended on Netflix and gave it a watch.    I tried to rewatch it but it was so cringy.
841,Heh  I have the first game installed for so long  played it for like 16 mins in 2020 (according to Steam) and then never launched it again  for some reason (probably cause I have so many games installed I try to go through them slowly).
842,Heh  its a bit out of date at this point but Dungeon Siege I & II were fun ARPG romps. Not the most in-depth skill trees but theres enough to keep you interested. Reminds me a lot of Grim Dawn and Diabloesque kinds of games. And because theyre so old at this point  the games are cheap af
843,Hell yea match next week can't wait to see more Chika lead bullet combos and Hyuse in action. I hope Osamu figures out what's bothering him I can't suspect him feeling weak again with Hyuse around but we'll see
844,Hell yeah  Pathfinder Kingmaker is one of the most popular games in the crpg fandom. I don't think Wrath of the Righteous is better in every way  it improves some stuff and makes others worse. I could live without every trash mob having at least 12  sometimes 21 spell resistance.
845,Hellcats 0-161km no extended idling  depress accelerator pedal slowly and no more then halfway  less then 3500rpm  88km/h max  and no aggressive braking  162-483km depress accelerator pedal slowly and no more then halfway to avoid rapid acceleration in lower gears (1st-3rd)  less then 5000rpm  112km/h max and no aggressive braking  484-805km Exercise the full engine rpm range (shifting manually at higher rpms when possible)  do not perform sustained operation with the accelerator pedal at wide open throttle and 136km/h max  806-2414km Do not participate in track events  sports schools or similar activities   Quite the procedure  with my 2018 Challenger hellcat I romped on it from the very beginning  but with my 2021 Durango Hellcat I followed it as closely as I could. Im currently at 920km but I dont plan on taking it to any tracks
846,hello   i need some rpgs to play that have controller support on pc  games that ive finished  Elder scrolls/ fallout series  Witcher series  Souls series  Nioh series  Divinity series  Elex  Kingdoms of amalur  fable  Wasteland series  Deus ex series  Assassins creed series  Dragons Dogma  Mass Effect series  Horizon Zero dawn  Middle earth series  Vampyr  &#x200B;  Thx for all the games guys   they are enough for a couple of weeks
847,Hello   I will be away on a trip for about a month or two  and I will have the time to play an RPG tittle or more  I will have my PS Vita  PSP  Switch and 3DS. So what titles do you recommend to play from the following list  also  feel free to add something else. Im interested to see what people think is a-must-play for a trip or something like it.  FYI  I recently finished Scarlet Nexus and currently playing Lunar 2.  Thanks  [View Poll](https://www.reddit.com/poll/pwe2vw)
848,Hello   My 2019 Mazda CX-5 GTR AWD has 35000 miles on it.  Mazda dealer recommended brake and coolant flush and replacement during the last oil change. I decided not to do it at that time.  Mazda owner's manual says to replace once in 10 years or 120000 miles  whichever comes first  I watched Scotty Kilmer's video on YouTube and tried the testing strips he recommended to check my brake and coolant fluid. Per the results of the testing strip  both fluids don't need to be replaced.  What do you recommend? Is there any benefit of replacing them even when the test strip says it's good?
849,Hello  I am gathering equipment to create a role-playing game. As part of this  I want be buy some minis online to paint. I would like to make a hex-based system  but I have run into the problem that there do not seem to be hex grids and bases on the market which are sold together.   I am worried that if I purchase a hex grid and bases separately  one will be slightly larger than the other and make my whole map look weird. This seems to be a problem with inner/outer diameter of hex bases  etc. Can anyone recommend a hex grid and mini bases which will sit flush together  and are hopefully also good quality?  Thanks very much!
850,Hello  I was just wondering  is there a reason game design is so esoteric ?  It seems to have a very ground up approach when I feel like programs that handle the behind the scenes work would make sense to be part of that process yet as I said most software I've looked in to is incredibly dense making the Design process excruciating as an individual
851,Hello  Im an inspiring game developer. My goal over the next 3 years is to create 3 different games. The first game is a hardcore survivor game centered around trying not to get killed by dinosaurs. You would be able to fight  make teams  craft  and build. The second game is a couch-play multiplayer 1v3 game  your objective is not to get killed by the killer. There would be 3 characters who all do different things to try and not get killed by the killer. The game would have  crafting  machinery  teamwork  and projectiles. The third and last game is a 2D platform shooter game  where instead of bullets you collect different fruits and vegetables and they affect how the player reacts. So for example  if the player got a dragon fruit  the projectile would leave a firey trail. The game would have  multiplayer  projectiles  powers  and an easy modding system. My main question is would these be really fun games!
852,Hello all  as the title I guess is suggesting  ps now has a TON of rpg games on it that I don't recognize. I'm assuming there's a few hidden gems in there but I don't want to like  trial and error 20 games before I find something.   What are some of the best RPGs on PS Now? For reference I love final fantasy turn based games  and have just beaten and loved pillars of eternity. any suggestions?
853,Hello everyone  got a bit unpleasant issue  I've never had before. Recently I started running Knave in my own OSR campaign  invited players with whom I've been playing for a long time already and trust them.   Though  we still had an empty chair so I invited this new player  let her call Lina.   Usually  I let my players to create and roll the characters on their own  even at home. They would bring really awful characters doing this way anyway. So I believe  they do not cheat.   So  the suspicions started when we started rolling new characters at the beginning of the game. Players needed to create 2 characters  as the first one is probably going to die during this session.  I was doing my stuff  some last minute prep and I didn't pay much attention  but Lina was really close to me  so I was checking on her from time to time (as she's the new player as well). And... I didn't see her rolling for HP  she put 7 (almost the maximum) for both characters  I thought she was just confused and reminded that she needs to roll twice  but she told me she rolled twice and it was a coincidence. Ok  maybe I just overlooked it  but I this got me suspicious.   Then next  after their death... we started rolling new characters  again really good HP  and suspiciously useful starting gear (we're rolling gear  making several rolls at different tables). Other players always roll something bad  we had 2 characters with 1 HP  outrageously bad starting gear. But Lina's characters were always really good.   So... I got no proof  but I am suspicious and I am not sure what to do. Do you allow rolling a new character alone?
854,Hello everyone. I hope you all are doing well. I'm here for a request:  Which Action-RPG or Turn-Based series would you recommend me for the SNES  GameCube  Wii  DS  GB  GBC or GBA?   I'm looking for some really fun action RPG or Turn-Based series that meet this criterias:  1. Nice gameplay 2. No overwhelming quantities of grinding required to progress and have fun. 3. Nice graphics (optional) 4. Nice music (optional) 5. Fun 6. Consistently good and lengthy kind of RPG series.  I hope I'm not asking for much.  Thanks for reading this post and/or answering it.
855,Hello everyone. I'm looking for a turn based  story heavy rpg. I would greatly enjoy a wide range for customization for my party  as well as having at least some freedom to explore and decide where to go. Additionally  extra or unique mechanics for combat would be appreciated. As for games I've played and loved: Dragon quest 8  9(my favorite)  and 11  Persona 5  Undertale  Fire emblem awakening.  I don't mind old or new games. I play on a well-equipped pc. Lesser known titles are great too.  Thank you in advance!
856,Hello game developers!  This is my [first sound effects pack](https://darkworldaudio.com/#SoundEffects) and it's focused around survival. There are 164 files featuring clothing  combat  destruction  environments  equipment  food  footsteps  human  medicine and tool sound effects.  All recorded and edited in 96kHz  24 bit and are in .wav  mono format. Metadata is included but as I have had some of these effects for years they don't conform to any particular standards. I've tailored them towards gamedevs with simple naming conventions and no spaces!  A license is included with the download which is really relaxed leaving you free to do more with the sounds.  They are great for quick prototyping but will do well mixed in your completed projects. Some of the files are very short and don't play well in VLC  pop them in your game engine and they'll be fine.  All the best   [Darkworld Audio](http://darkworldaudio.com)
857,"Hello my friends. One thing i noticed i've been doing ever since i started DM'ing is taking modules and rpg books - regardless of whether they are from the same system i'm using - and utilizing elements and ideas from them as inspirations for my campaign. From taking the characters/npc's as written in there and simply assigning them system-proper stats to just using the locations as original ideas  i've noticed i work much better when i take the content i find to be most ""useful"" for my player's campaign and slapping them on it.  So  i wanted to ask from those who have done this before or haven't done it but have a good sugestion anyway: Which books and modules have plenty of items  characters  locations and generally interesting ideas that one could slap in another system and make it work with little to no modifcation regarding the lore or just interesting ideas to use in your campaigns/one-shots in general?"
858,Hello yes this is me. I own like.......god at least 20 different RPG systems and I find it extremely difficult to keep my interest in any given one for long periods of time  so I bounce around a ton. My friends put up with it since noone else wants to DM but it can be extremely frustrating for both them and me. Not sure what to do about it though. My brain just won't stick to a setting very well.
859,Hello!  I am currently running 2 campaigns  one for D&D 5e  and the other for Delta Green/Call of Cthulhu. I enjoy it a lot  and so does my player  but Ive noticed that  when narrating  my voice usually isnt very engaging or interesting. My character voices are fine  but I as a player enjoy a more immersive tone for a GM so I feel like im really in the game  but it feels hard to do without being fake.  Its not a big deal at all  but I would like some tips on having a strong voice as a GM! Thank you!  Edit: by voice  I mean actual speaking voice  not a writing voice  although tips on that kind of voice are always appreciated (:
860,Hello! I have been playing RPG games for as long as I've been able to use computers. I think at this point I've played almost all RPGs on the market :v  Right now  I'm looking for an RPG with a choice consequence  a variety of gear  and a beautiful open world to explore.   I would very much prefer more obscure recommendations since if it's a mainstream entry  I'll have most likely played it. Thanks in advance!

871,"Hello! I'm choosing the field between Graphics Design and IT in Administration... My dream job is to become a QA/Game Tester.  I would like to go on Graphics Design  but unfortunately  I like to do only PC graphics/visual communication and I don't like drawing. So there is zero chance I'll get on Graphics Design...   My question is  can I go on IT in Administration instead? I'm still not sure what I would like really to do in life. I'm really into exploring every corner of the game and brake as much of it as I can. But lots of people say I'm good at communication and that I should focus on a field  that is oriented with Public Relations. I enjoy talking to people  represent something in front of others  and being in a suit all day. So yeah  PR is the option also  but as I said  I'm not sure what I would like really to do in the end.  I just want to be sure  if that school wouldn't be waste of time if I will not like it in the end. There is also typography  graphics  and multimedia  but it's not discussed that much in-depth as on Graphics Design. I'm just honestly scared of college math and law. But I see it as a ""safe-point"" if I somehow get bored of games.  Thank you for your time and have a nice day!"
872,Hello! I've been developing a game for a year and a half.   Recently I started to publish versions to try to get bug reports and fix as many as possible.  I'm posting them on my Discord channel  it's a small community (200+ members).  I created the steam page and also the Kickstarter page. But I'm undecided on how to proceed  what I wanted to do is get a good number of backers on Kickstarter  start the campaign and stop posting versions on Discord as one of the rewards of the campaign is early access to Steam.  I've never been a fan of early access but I've realised it's crucial for indie projects with low budget.  Do you think I should proceed like this or publish an early access on a smaller site like itch so I can still accumulate a budget.  Also  how many backers would be optimal to have before starting the Kickstarter campaign? if I ever start it. The budget is around 10 000 .
873,Hello! Were creating a hypercasual game with a level system similar to that of Parkour Race or Soccer Star  in that there are infinite levels that are very similar to each other. My question is  in these types of games  is every levels map generation predetermined or randomized  and how is it done? For example  if my friend and I both download Parkour Race  will our Level 1 - Level 953 be identical in the map layouts  or are they completely randomized for each respective player? If they are predetermined  how do they accomplish this? Do they just store the data for how each level will look beforehand  or is each level determined by the previous levels map generation? Must know the best approach for doing this. Thank you all for your assistance!
874,Hello.   I'm trying to find a specific GDC lecture regarding creativity  game design  and tabletop mechanics.  I believe it was presented by a woman  she broke down how all games can be expressed as very simple types of tabletop games etc.  For example  fighting games are Rock  Paper  Scissors but with range.  She then challenged everyone to come up with new genres  or seemingly contradictory genres and express the mechanics with this tabletop understanding of games.  I figure someone else here probably remembers it!  Thank you for your time.
875,"Hello.  I'm sure I'm not the only one in this situation  and I'm sure some of you fixed that toxic behaviour for themselves.  Long story short  every single time I start a new media  I need a notebook to take notes. It's compulsive. I have to pause the show I'm watching  for instance  to write how I would turn such and such cool aspect into a proper game. It makes all media experience very tedious  I simply can't watch a movie without pausing it nowadays  and I KNOW I would enjoy the media so much more if I gave it a chance to be what it is rather than turn it into some RPG delirium. I want to just enjoy a TV show for once  without thinking about RPGs.  And that has consequences on my will to run games  too! Because every single time I attempt to be ""ready"" for a session  I can't help but tell myself ""you should watch XYZ  there might be great inspiration there!"". So in the end  I don't watch anything  nor do I run games.  I'm at a loss. Please help?"
876,"Hello. I'm trying to make a 2D game in Unity similar in perspective and controls as Hotline Miami with RPG aspects.

Decreases very quickly once the mouse is not over an enemy. (I will probably make a different way of gaining and losing Focus for NPCs) !<  &#x200B;  Edit: I just realized the Focus value mentioned in the spoiler above might be better for determining whether a hit lands/is blocked or not  instead of for the damage calculation when the hit lands. Consider them not relevant to the values down below. Focus would work in tandem with the Distance value. Distance is  well  the distance between the attacker and the target. It would only be used for attacks with ranged weapons. This will be easy to set up with a method overload. Higher the distance  lower the chances to hit. Higher the focus  higher the chances. So you can either take your time to put a well aimed shot at a distance  from cover  or run up to the target and blast him point-blank. Both will be quite likely to hit (~~add that 0.0001% chance of critical failure just to remind the player that life isn't fair)~~. Some weapons will have higher long range accuracy or ~~higher damage falloff~~ (maybe not? this game is set in some pretty cramped spaces. Bad idea?.). See the decision tree paragraph down below for how that is planned out  \-The attacker's **Strength** stat  an int between 0-20. 0 being someone unconscious  20 being the hulk  and perhaps 10 being a strong but realistic human warrior. Strength should weigh in quite heavily (pun not intended) and will determine whether a punch will tickle a target or rip their skull open.  &#x200B;  \-I require constants for the **decision tree** (I already coded it) that has several iterations of this damage formula but with different armor and weapon constants. The decision tree will be ran every time a hit is landed. A bladed weapon will be very good against unarmoured opponents  but will be stopped by plate armour  yet plate armour will not protect so much against blunt weapons. Likewise fire damage is good against enemies naked or clad in plate armour  but is mostly neutralized by power armour . I need a variable in the formula that I can hardcode on each branch of the decision tree . (technically this paragraph concerns both the attacked and the attacker but i didnt know where to put it)  &#x200B"
877,"Here are the main things:  * Wanted more *meaningful* character choices that weren't just about better numbers * Wanted more *flavorful* character choices that matter in the metagame * Want to get away from D&D-style fantasy  and sometimes from fantasy altogether * Wanted better rules that support fun rather than GM ""Gotcha!"" * Wanted more meaningful choices in terms of equipment  abilities in a system that isn't afraid of characters having capabilities / player creativity * Wanted easier customization  and in some cases one ruleset that works across multiple genres - 5E is awful at trying to do anything but D&D  and it's only mediocre at that."

880,"Here is some constructive criticism:  * You are using a lot of time on explaining things which have nothing to do with the input system  like how to create a new project and how you set up your scene. This is not the topic of your tutorial  so it's not a good way to use the time of your audience. Yes  I know  watchtime = money on YouTube. But there could have been more useful things to say about the new input system. * You are doing a lot of things without explaining why you are doing them. Like how you create an input action asset without explaining what that is. Why do you change the input type from ""Button"" to ""Value"" (and not to ""Pass Through"")? Why do you choose the composite type ""2D vector"" instead of ""value"" for your move binding? Is ""Listen"" the only way to tell Unity what key to bind? This method of explaining to people what to do but not why and what the alternatives are is how people are kept from escaping tutorial hell and from becoming self-sufficient developers. * You are not using the PlayerInput component the way it's supposed to. The point of that component is that it implements an event-based programming pattern. That's why it offers not one  not two  not three but [four different way of calling methods on other scripts when input events happen](https://docs.unity3d.com/Packages/com.unity.inputsystem@1.1/manual/Components.html#notification-behaviors). One particularly interesting application is using ""Invoke Unity Events"" and then using input events to directly play animations or set triggers in an Animator component. That allows you to trigger animations on keypresses without a single line of code! However  if you prefer to program the way you are doing it in this tutorial - by polling InputActions during Update -  you are better off using [the wrapper class you can auto-generate from the InputActions asset](https://docs.unity3d.com/Packages/com.unity.inputsystem@1.0/manual/ActionAssets.html#auto-generating-script-code-for-actions). * When you want to bind a gamepad stick to a Vector2 action  then you don't need to create a composite binding and bind all 4 directions to 4 different stick directions separately. You can just create a regular non-composite binding and then bind the whole gamepad stick to it."

882,"Here's a couple examples i can think of i like.  Onion Knight (Final Fantasy 3) - The Onion Knight doesn't learn special abilities  but 1. Can equip any armor  2. Only one who can equip Onion equipment (very powerful)  and most of all 3. Lower stats most levels  but at level 90 rapidly maxes out their stats to 99 unlike others.  Dragon Age Inquisition grappling hooks - The warriors and the Rogues both have a grappling hook ability that differs from each other. Warriors can grapple an enemy to bring them in close  interesting for crowd control. But the rogue can grapple an enemy and pull themselves to the enemy.  Borderlands  abilities that 'stack' - I love the growing rewards from abilities that stack. Gaige for example generates Anarchy stacks when she runs her magazines or drums to empty without reloading  each time giving her 1 stack and a bonus to damage output but reduction in accuracy. By reloading without emptying a magazine  they disappear. These kinds of stacking abilities interest me for their rewards for different playstyles. By playing less safe  you deal more damage  but the reduced accuracy makes you play less safe again  but that in turn generates more damage output again.  Rikku's ""Use"" and ""Mix"" (Final Fantasy X) - Although every character can use items in general (potions and basic stuff)  only Rikku can ""Use"" special items such as bombs and stuff. Its also helpful that she's a thief  and without jumping through hoops to make other thieves  only she can acquire these special items in a timely manner. What's most interesting  is her overdrive (if you haven't played FFX  its just the term for Limit Break here) caled ""Mix""  where she can take any 2 consumable items and combine them into a new effect - some of them unique  some powerful  and some are both or neither. For example  you can combine 2 potions to simply make a better potion. But she can mix rare items that only she can use to create effects like ""99 999"" where each character for the rest of the battle (or until an individual is knocked out) deals 99 999 damage. I think she also has a rare Mix that turns the party invincible for a time. She very arguably simply has the best overdrive in the game  its the crux of low level style runs.  Whats an interesting ability to you? Any character in particular stick out as having a really cool toolkit in general? Or a specific skill tree with interesting abilities? Or  how about even a specific build for a character thats interesting when put together?  I like"
883,"Here's an older game: Two Worlds.  If you get the PC version (it's on [Steam](https://store.steampowered.com/agecheck/app/1930/) and [GOG](https://www.gog.com/game/two_worlds))  make sure you get the patch that fixes the voice-syncing problem. And *yes* the voice-acting from the main character is... odd. He uses ""thee"" and ""thou"" and ""verily"" a *LOT*. It's annoying at first  but after a while it turns comical because he's so consistent about it.  So get this: you can basically ignore the main plot. It's something about some wizard who kidnapped your sister for some sort of ritual  and he makes you do errands for him. But forget all that. While you're in the Obligatory Starting Village whose actual name I forget  you're told he's waiting for you outside. He's easy to see  and if you don't get too close he won't trigger the next cutscene  and the plot won't advance.  You don't need it anyway. *None* of the side-quests are attached to the main plot in any fashion. So just stay away from him  and go wander."
884,"Here's my speculation:  Based on what we're told about Gods and each of their oaths  we can go back and figure out the purposes of their actions. Furthermore we can use their new ""Unlife"" as a point of comparison to Will's *own* new second Life. Fundamentally  I feel they are in reversed positions.  Will spent his first life entirely meaninglessly and without hope  you could even say he abandoned the Gods of our world if you want to put it that way. He uses his opportunity after getting isekai'd to take a new lease on life. On the other hand  our three Undead parents were probably great heroes during life  or they probably stayed very close to their oaths  however some tragedy cut them short  they gave up their oaths  and now they are probably living very meaningless lives. They might feel as Will felt.  First  we know that their Gods abandoned them because they made a new contract with the God of Undeath.  Second  we know that the Gods will actually still listen to them if they try exceptionally hard to contact them - Mary is an indication of this  that the values they held as humans can still be held as undead. She can still pray  and receive the grace of the Earth mother  it's just very difficult.  Third  we have their oaths. Blood swore to train every day and grow strong. Mary swore she would live in a way that would honor Mater's Will. Gus swore that he would do as he pleased and ""enjoy life"".  Let's assume that Mary is the only one that is currently receiving favor from her old God. Blood says ""you either become a hero or you die"" - this indicates to me that he probably died before becoming a hero and since experiencing undeath has given up on doing so. Maybe he couldn't save the city from the apocalypse that befell it. So what about Gus? Well  I've got a theory that he hasn't considered his ""Unlife"" as actual Life. So he has reasoned that no amount of enjoying himself will ever be seen as a fulfillment of his oath towards the God of Wind  because he's undead.  So Will's growing up and both Blood and Gus intend to let him kill them because they feel no meaning without the blessings of their oaths. Gus attacks Will in the sewer with this intent.  Oh  and also  Gus is smart so he probably has figured out Will's secret. ""Rock and Roll"" is an idiom. Will couldn't possibly have an understanding of a phrase like that and be able to explain it so confidently without previously having lived in a societal context where that made sense. Gus' entire life is understanding the magic of words  do we really believe he hasn't figured it out? So Gus understands Will is experiencing a second life  just like him.  Will relents and he says  specifically ""I do not want to fight you to the death"". Boom. Gus's perspective of his undeath shifts  possibly for the first time in millennia. Will  someone who is living again  tells Gus that he thinks of both of their ""lives"" in the same way. He experiences the joy of the new lease on life that Will has given him and ex"
885,Heres the basic premise: A group of people who live together are unable to leave their apartement. The front door refuses to open  windows will neither open nor break  and there is no way out. After days of hunger and confusion  a completely new door suddenly appears in the apartement. It leads into a maze of coridoors  rooms and hallways. Gradually  as they explore this bizarre place that seems to go on forever  they come to realize that they have done something horrible together that they cant remember  and this place is slowly changing to torture and punish them. They must figure out what they did  who is to blame and how they can use this knowledge to maybe  possibly somehow escape this nightmare.    This is where Im stuck. I have some loose ideas  but nothing Im completely happy with.   Does anyone have any ideas for how I can flesh out this scenario? Ideally this should be able to be played through in one five to six hour session.

888,Hero Kids. The answer is almost always Hero Kids.  - only ~25 pages of rules  - can be modified for almost any genre  - easily integrate checks and mechanics from other games you know to adjust challenge level  - character creation is open  adaptable  and draws kids in  - using the same character sheets for enemies you create helps kids correlate between their PCs and their opponents
889,Hero System-- by default cinematic but you can make it as lethal as you please. There is very little abstraction in the combat system.  GURPS is also a good call.   Phoenix Command has got you covered for precise simulation but unless you program it into a computer I'm not sure how well it will work as an actual game. Maybe someone who has played it can refute that.
890,Hey  do any of you get this too? When you finish a game that was thoroughly fun and enjoyable  then everyone leaves and you're just alone and feel melancholic because of it?  I play with friends on Discord and am mostly a DM  and after we finish the game we do a post-game talk  bouncing ideas back and forth  commenting on things and such  and it's huge fun  but then when people sign off  I just feel like there's nothing left for me to do but to sit there and wait for the next thing to happen.  I introspectively know that I have a depressive tendency  don't feel like talking to other people because I don't quite perceive them as friends or enjoyable to talk to  or also because they're busy/asleep and I don't have a lot else going on in my social life outside of TTRPGs  but I wonder if this is something other people who don't have these issues go through as well?  If so  what are your experiences and solutions for it  if any? At times I feel like the only thing I really wanna do for life is play TTRPGs  but I know that it's not possible  so I'm left with that unpleasant conundrum.

892,Hey  learning alone is a pain. Even if you're used to it. I'd suggest to take courses. I'm having courses for Unity 2D and 3D by Gamedev.tv. I'm very satisfied.  On Udemy  courses often drop to 12 EUR  so it's not expensive but it helps a lot.   And if you're making a game purely  without an engine  I'm sure that there are some free tutorials out there that will help you as well as paid ones. Don't be afraid to ask for help and learn from others.  If making a game is or ever was a dream of yours  don't give up on it.   Just like with everything else... Once you make it  it becomes so beautiful.  Edit: Btw i am also a web dev with Angular and Flutter  but i also love Unity and C#  I might try Unreal at some point  but I find C++ too difficult.
893,Hey  you are just like me!! My wife helped me with it  listen out and maybe it may work with you...  We jumped into a co-op system  Ironsworn. We both play and GM  at the same time  because thats how co-op works. She does not prep  and was always a player in her TTRPG games. I felt bad preparing things off-game because I did not want to take her out of her co-GM spot. I did not want to come to a table loaded with things to unpack and expect her to follow along. After all  the system has tables to decide things on demand  which she uses and I would never be able to prep against RNG events.  Eventually  we got the hang of it. Now  I do some prep  just enough so I feel confortable but without ever asserting concrete things. This way of tackling preparation made me pay less attention to detail  I could enjoy shows and even make show-like scenes better. I think that you are bound to miss the point when studying these scenes as they have little connection to RPG scenes  where you read both the situation and the players.  Take a break of your system  try co-GMing  you will learn to work with others  share your responsibilities and will not feel the need for such an onerous habit of studying scene details.

I've sent out emails to almost 100 people  i've tried different email types  some short some long. I've made short trailers  long trailers  included keys in the email  etc etc etc.  I'll drop a link below and if anyone could give some friendly advice on how to get this out to the world id greatly appreciate it. I cannot even begin to tell you how much is on the line with this game launch.

899,Hey how's it going. I've recently changed the inventory system that my RPG is going to use from a slot based (like rust) to a modified version of skyrims (Sky UI).   My question is  which would be the best way of having the same item in multiple arrays.   There are buttons at the top that will switch between different item types. let's imagine that the inventory currently has a sword  a chestplate  and health potion. One tab will have all items displayed  while subsequent tabs will only display their appropriate items. For example  weapon tab displays weapons  armor displays the chest plate  and potions displays the health potion.  There will also be a tab to display favorited items.   There are two ways i could think of doing this.  1) Have one main array which is the All Items window. This array will be permanent and is where weight and armor value etc is calculated for the player. When a different item tab is opened  the main array gathers its items that have the desired type  and create a new array with just those items. This new array is only temporary and will be deleted upon changing windows. When selecting an item to use  it will send a message to the original array to take action on the item.  2) Only have one array. When switching tabs the window will see what items match the desired type  and hide all other ones. I don't know if this is actually possible though.   I am going to be making this network replicated in the future  if that would make one better than the other.   Is there another way of doing this that I haven't considered? Any help is greatly appreciated.

901,Hey OP   I'm really into playing games while listening to NPR  podcasts  etc. My current favorite (not an RPG) is Slay the Spire. I guess it helps to pay a lot of attention  especially when you're starting off; but eventually you get into a groove and it's a great game to play while listening to something in the background.   Such a fun game. So addictive.

903,Hey! I've designed and illustrated a handful of TTRPGs. Here's what the development process has looked like for me.  **Step one: Write down your initial idea and make some choices about the scope of your project.**  You're making a game. Great! This is a *project*  and your odds of finishing this thing are hugely improved by having a plan. There are a lot of questions you'll want to think about before starting:  * *What am I trying to create?* From your replies  it looks like you want to develop a game **setting**; a world with cool places  characters  or story prompts rather than a game. There are plenty of system-agnostic settings out there that people love and you can draw inspiration from! But that's for you to think about; you're in charge of deciding what this is.  * *What elements does this project need when complete?* TTRPG books will often have character creation tools and rules of play. They may have setting information or development tools; maybe this game even has a map. Perhaps there are prewritten adventures. Longer works will need a table of contents  or a glossary.  * *What's the vibe?* How do you want people to feel when they engage with this work? What kind of tone are you going for -- pulpy  dark  emotional  weird  welcoming? Having a consistent tone across your writing is surprisingly helpful.  Pen these thoughts down; don't just think them through. This document will become an important way to ground your development process when you feel lost. I also often work directly from the outline when I'm writing the rules  so this document eventually becomes the TTRPG itself.  **Step two: Write down just enough rules and prompts to start playtesting. Then  start playtesting.**  Games don't spring fully-formed from our brains  as much as we might like them to! To make a good game  you have to make something that *works*... and the only way to know what works is to test it.  So  grab some friends and run a little adventure. See what works and what doesn't. Consider: is the structure of play clear? Does the game feel the way you wanted it to? What's the most fun part of playing  and how can you develop the game in that direction? What are people confused by?  **Step three: Actually write the thing.**  This will be the longest part of your process! If you've never written something like this before  you definitely want to be reading through other TTRPG books for reference. If you've never done technical writing (communicating instructions)  you may also want to read through a couple articles on the topic. Practice will help  but there are basic rules that will guide you in making something clear.  You'll often need to go back and edit what you've worked on  or tweak stuff as the writing starts to come together.  **Step four: Find someone to do a full readthrough.**  Once you've got it all sketched out  you'll need someone else to read it. Even the best writers in the world have editors! Things that made sense when you wrote it might not

905,Heya  My group of freinds just finished our latest campaign and are now in that akward break phase of figuring out who's going to voulnteer to GM next.    I really want to do so as it'll give our forever GM a much needed player time  but the only problem is that I am not that smart and have a hard time understanding complex rules and keeping track of all GM stuff.   I know there's stuff like honey hiest but I wanna try running something that's a bit longer than just a one-shot  but other than that I'm open to any game system that's hopefully not too complicated!     TL;DR What's a good system that a dumbass like me could easily run.
906,Hi    I am trying to write a storyline about an Abrahamic Angel.   Not settled on which one it is yet.   My problem is: I want to research the Mythology and the Personalities. But I don't want to Read the entire collection of holy books.  I am searching for secondary sources.   But Google is not really helpful. Just Pages upon Pages of Esoteric mush that is explaining when to pray to specific angels. That does not really interest me. I want Story bits. Information about Personality.   If someone knows like a Wiki Page or some other reccource that helps in that regard I would be really thankful for some Links.
907,"Hi   I recently bought the Italian copy of Dishonored RPG  I read it all but there are several things about the chaos that are not clear to me. I tried to consult an English manual to see if the lack of clarity was due to the translation  but I haven't found any >!(and I don't want to buy the same manual twice \*wink wink\*)!<  so I turn to you and I hope you can help me.  So  here are my concerns:  1. in the comic contained in the manual and used to present the rules you see players **generating chaos** to **create** a **truth**  but the rulebook doesn't mention this possibility; can it be done? 2. the GM can **create truths** by **spending chaos only** as an **effect for an NPC roll** (or at least  that's what I found under ""spend chaos"")  but in the same comic you can see the GM **spending chaos** to **introduce a complication** in the middle of the scene; can it be done? And if so  how much chaos does it cost? 3. Finally  where the skill tests are explained the manual says that you can **increase the difficulty of a test by spending chaos**  but does not say what the cost is  where can I find it?  I know I shouldn't be overly picky and tailor the rules to my playgroup  but I'd like to get a good understanding of the ""vanilla"" rules before applying tweaks  fully understanding the style the authors had in mind with this game.  Thanks in advance!"
908,Hi   I'm currently working on mechanism of a match-3 game and I'm looking for someone who can explain me the board border and background. I use Unity.  &#x200B;  Basically I already have my board generated and according to Tiles position  I would like to automatically have a board border and background added (maybe on different z-axis / layer)  &#x200B;  However If my board is not a square or a rectangle  I do not know how to AUTOMATICALLY generate/determine what should be the border type/sprite.  &#x200B;  Should it be in inspector a particular List of gameobject  or could it be done somehow differently ?  To make it clearer  I added an example ([Example of match-3 game BOARD borders](https://ibb.co/P1fZYKc)) of what I'm trying to achieve (border/background).  Thank you for your help.
909,"Hi   Model: MSI 970a-g43  I was trying to make room for a ""new"" graphic card and had to unplug some cables from the motherboard in order to make them go under the power cable to the motherboard.  The cables i removed and plugged in again was audio and USB for the front of the case. I then installed the graphic card and tried to boot it and it was dead  no fans started - nothing.  I made sure all cables and power cables on the motherboard was connected and i even looked at the manual and reconnected all the cables for the Fpanel thinking i might had pulled one of those.  Did i fry my motherboard? I must admit i was not super careful. I have an old computer in my basement  should i test the motherboard in that? or what is my next step?"

The only streaming services I have is Netflix and Crunchyroll. Before watching Anime  I barely used any streaming services and mostly used DVD's. Since I am having trouble deciding what streaming services I should use  I would gladly appreciate it if you guys/gals would recommend other streaming services to me or if I should stick with Netflix and Crunchyroll.

917,Hi  I've got an old pc with an Acorp 6LX/EX68 motherboard  and the problem is that my PS/2 mouse can't be recognized. The mouse itself works fine  I've checked it on a laptop with the same drivers and the same copy of Windows 98 SE. I've checked circuit continuity of the ground and the 5 volt lines with a multimeter from the PS/2 port on my motherboard to the ATX socket and everything seems to be ok. I've also check circuit continuity of wires from the plug to the port I attached to the back of my case  and everything seems to be ok as well. The cables are set in a right way (see schemes). I can't see any option to enable PS/2 port in BIOS  but I've heard that it should power on automatically. I've also tried Windows XP SP3  but since I've got 64 MB of RAM it's hard to use it. Nonetheless it didn't work either.

918,Hi  so I've been trying to find a fun RPG to play wherein I can create a party from scratch  I would like it to have a Pet class  Wizard  Warrior  and an Assassin class.  I've been getting into Pathmaker and was wondering if I should buy the new one.  As long as I can make my own party I should enjoy it but I have played a few games like this that I didn't enjoy too much  since I have most of the cRPGs on Steam I don't really need suggestions to play them like Pillars of Eternity and Divinity Original Sin.  I am looking for a game where I can level up my party and with loot that actually makes you feel like you are intimidating in that world not just the same Robes/Armor and Weapons.  I would really appreciate any help on this I caught Covid so I've been stuck inside and the boredom is getting to me  Thanks in advance!
919,"Hi :)  I'm working on kind of a business management sim with a crafting system that's partly inspired by Rimworld and managed to think myself into a dilemma.  tl;dr: How can I manage storage of random high-quality crafts when my player does not have the storage space to do so but not-storing would feel like a punishment?  \---  Let's say the player manages a manufactory for furniture. One of the goods she can have her Employees craft is chairs.  As long as the chosen employees are okay  their crafting results will be ""Chair - normal"". But maybe  she uses an employee with high crafting skills. In this case  the result has the chance to be ""Chair - neat"" or ""Chair - well crafted"". *(That's the Rimworld part.)*  But: I want to use a storage system that's based on ""boxes""  as in ""one box for a maximum stacksize of X \[Ware\]"". I would basically have one box for Chair-normal  one for Chair-neat  and so on. The reason is that I want my player to invest in her business - in this case the inventory capacity. Each new box costs a rising amount of money  up until she has all the boxes unlocked.  The resulting problem is that these proccs *can happen anytime and are not bound to storage space*. As in: if all storage boxes are filled with wares and materials  my player has a storage problem for sudden proccs.  I came up with three solutions so far and would love to hear your input.  1. Proccs can't happen in a quality not already stored in the storage area. (Which would be sad because that would mainly target the really  really good quality proccs players would want) 2. Each unlocked storage box is  in reality  *three* boxes that can store one type of crafting result  in each of the possible quality proccs (I like this idea the most  but struggle in depicting how that could be handled visually in an easy to understand and access way) 3. Sudden  unstorable proccs land on ""the heap"" - basically a kind of unlimited storage area that has the caveat of being easy to steal from (after a random amount of time  stuff gets deleted from the heap). This would give players a small window of time to make space in their storage areas but it would feel terrible if you were done shipping/selling/destroying products and a second before you drag the item from the heap  it disappears.  Basically  I want to give the players the chance to actually store epic stuff and not lose out on these special (and high-value) items. On the other hand  this game is about crafting lots of things and selling in bulk  would missing out on a single epic item make a difference? Monetarily possibly not  but emotionally probably yes.  I feel like thinking in circles.  Is there a good idea in here? Do you know a game that handled something like that  be it in a bad or in a good way? I've been playing a lot of tycoon games over the last couple of years but none worked in this way  as far as I remember - and in Rimworld  stuff would just drop onto the ground  there's no real storage-problem.  I would "

921,"Hi all  looking for rulesets including homebrew or niche rulesets that can do gun combat really well. I know that at the end of the day  realism and pen and paper just aren't a thing  but I'm looking for rules that capture at least a very realistic feeling set of rules for combat in settings that stick to low magic  no magic or firearms based settings.  The more rules-lite the better  but will look at anything that is suggested that I can get my hands on!  \---  Edit for clarity -   Realistic should be interpreted broadly and I'm open to a lot of stuff.   What I am looking for is mostly moving away from hit points and replacing it with a more believable wound system. If you get shot  you shouldn't say ""drat  I had 100 hit points and now I have 95 hit points oh well I better use a heal item and forget about it"". I'm also ok if it is not quite ""Gee wiz a small knife wound to the hand time to be bedridden for 6 months"". This system does not need to be graphic (roll 2d6 for meters of intestines bursting out... nope!) or crunchy just believable enough.  I'm also really interested in psychology rules because frankly any rules that have you acting cool and calm in a fight  let alone a gunfight  are pretty BS. I know I read one where you needed to make some sort of test or you just repeated the last action  IE continue shooting mindlessly into the bushes  that was cool. Similarly I think it was delta green that made you take psych checks and if you failed you would either fight  flight or feint. Stuff like that is fantastic.  I'm looking for vaguely realistic firearms rules that are ideally based on real world data - how likely is it that you will hit someone running away at 20 meters? Or how likely is it that a cop can shoot a crazed knife dude before he gets shanked? Have a hit chance similar to that.   \--  The aim is to take what I like from the rules and try to mash it all up into something relatively lightweight and believable to use for games with my group. Always liked the idea of brewing and making rules but have no experience and particularly no experience getting shot at!"
922,Hi all  So as the title says  my PC crashes to a solid random color then restarts while gaming (black  Grey  green  yellow  pink...) . This happened to me few weeks ago  on random intervals (once a day to never to 5 times a day).   The PC is brand new (bought a month ago) except for the GPU (GTX 970  my budget couldn't afford a newer one)  I thought at first it was due to a fauly connection so I checked all the plugs and everything is well connected. I then clean uninstalled my graphic driver using DDU and reinstalled them  this fixed the problem for about a week or so everything was working fine no crashes  even after stress testing it and playing games for long hours.  Fast forward to today  with the Battlefield 2042 Beta  and bam  it starts crashing and releasing again  randomly  sometimes in the beginning of a match  sometimes after 3 or 4 matches. Tried GTA Online (a game that never crashed before) same thing  played RDR2 for 2 hours (a more demanding game than the rest) and it worked fine without a crash.  Here are my specs: CPU: Ryzen 5 3600 CPU Cooler: Xigmatek Winpower 1266 Mobo: Gigabyte B450 DSH3 V2 RAM: XPG 8 Go x2 3000 MHz PSU: Cooler Master MWE White 600W  SSD: Lexar NVMe 500 Gb HDD: Toshiba 1To Case: Raidmax F01  My temps are well in the normal range: 34C idle and 45 to 64C max gaming for the CPU and between 60 and 74C max for the GPU.   I should note that I underclocked my GPU using Afterburner to -100 MHz Core clock and -40 Mhz Memory clock cause I was suspecting my GPU. Needless to say it didn't help either.   If you have any suggestions or ideas please help me. I am out of budget and I can't afford a new PC nor a new GPU.   Thank you in advance
923,Hi all!  I've already worked on other gamedev projects but I keep coming back to the idea of also making a lewd/an adult game. I want it to be as small as possible  just a tiny MVP.  I'm  a software developer and artist  but I'd love to find a kind partner to work with on a super-small project like that. Is there a space where lewd gamedevs find each other? To me it's important to find someone who holds empathetic values.  If I can't find  someone like that it's also OK of course. I'm technically comfortable making games myself  but it would be lovely to create something tiny together with someone. So I just thought I'd ask here if anyone knows something? Maybe  there's a discord-server  maybe a subreddit etc.? Crossing my fingers someone here knows something!  Thanks in advance!

932,Hi everyone!  I play JRPGs from time to time. I played some classics (Chrono Trigger  Dragon Quest V  Pokmon...) but I don't really consider myself a fan. So I'm looking for things that are out of the ordinary to be surprised.  My question is this:  * **Do you know of any JRPGs with innovative gameplays? And if so  what are the best ones for you?**  I ask this question because  for me  a video game is above all a gameplay. I don't really care about the characters and the storyline as long as the game itself is out of the box.  For your information  I consider that Chrono Trigger had an innovative gameplay. So did Persona and Shin Megami Tensei. Radiant Historia (for those who know) also has a little something extra with its 3x3 grid in combat.  I don't know if I'm clear but **to sum up: I'm looking for JRPGs with gameplays that stand out**. I thank you in advance for your advice!  PS : I already tested Valkyria Chronicles  I don't like it too much. But if you know some very good T-RPGs that you think are better than Valkyria  I'm really interested!

936,Hi guys    I just started to put my first devlog about a game I'm starting to build onto youtube  I completely underestimated the amount of additional work it takes and how unhappy one can be with their own results :D The base idea was to hold myself accountable for any lack of progress because I threw away a lot of private projects in the past due to lack of motivation  hurdles  or just not enough time. I would be very happy to hear your personal ways of dealing with procrastination  your opinion on the video linked and general tips to engage a following for your own projects.   I was very motivated by other content creators which I'm following (ThinMatrix  DevDuck etc.) and think that this kind of public display of progress can help to keep the motivation up and maybe even engage interest in the projects currently being worked on. I hope this post doesn't fall under the show-off rule...  [Link to the devlog on Youtube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pgZhelzT12A&ab_channel=inaminute)  Looking forward to reading your opinions in the comments!
937,Hi guys   I recently started One Piece and just finished the Arlong arc. It seems like Luffy doesn't really kill the big enemies they (so far at least) just beat them up really bad. Is this for censoring intense violence? It doesn't seem like it because Zoro's initial run-in with mihawk and  now that I'm thinking about it  just about every henchman Zoro kills with his swords. So I'm just wondering if I'm supposed to think of Arlong as dead or is Luffy's choice of leaving them alive going to come back to bite him and that's purposeful for intended character development later on in the story?   Thanks guys really enjoying OP so far. Also please no spoilers in the replies!
938,Hi guys   I'm readying up to start posting gifs and updates for the game I'm working on.   I was wondering what everyone's opinions are on using a branded twitter just for gamedev (which most seem to do) or just tweeting that stuff out on your personal account?  I work in digital marketing and it's already enough keeping track of multiple accounts in my day to day. I like the idea of using one twitter account as I generally rant and talk about games anyway w/ some dog pics.   I already went through and removed 80% of my followers and left myself with just people I think would care but I'm still undecided.  Branded or personal + why?  Every reply gets a big fat kiss.
939,"Hi guys  I have a haunted mansion mission set up for Halloween. One of the enemy types in this mission are ghosts. The party won't know there are ghosts at first because they aren't visible. But I will have the party rolling (with no bonuses) against the attacks from the ghosts. At first they will be ""feeling a chill"" and other such hints at ghosts  and taking small damages periodically if they fail the rolls (which is likely to happen a couple times).    I want there to be various ways for the party to be able to see the ghosts  to regain their bonuses in combat. These can be objects or contraptions or really anything that can logically work that could be found in the house. I basically want them to be able to aquire a means of seeing the ghosts within the mission.  The only method I have right now are a pair of glasses that they can find in the house.  What other objects or methods can be used to locate these invisible ghosts?   I've never seen the movie  but I'm pretty sure what I gave is basically 13 ghosts (but these ghosts are only a segment of the mission)"
940,Hi guys I previously had two sessions with multiple tabs on edge browser but I kept the browser closed to save memory and stuff  So I would reopen the browser if I went into  head to the recently open tab and restore the other session so it did not disappear   So today I opened the browser and went to to that but the other session was gone. OVER 100 tabs  and this one is actually important unlike the other session that is JUST MUSIC!  so I went this pc  windows c  users  me  app data  local  Microsoft  edge  user data  default  sessions  And all I have from the previous session is a tabs file which I know has the information of the previous tabs but I have no way of using just that file to restore the previous session  Is there a way to restore using another method? The tabs file is from the 2nd of this month  Or can I somehow open the file and read the information then just copy the links or search for the tabs individually?  Please help meee!
941,Hi guys. I'm looking for a certain type of RPG. One more focused on the day to day aspects of being a free lance adventurer more than being a world saving mega-God or something. I'm looking for something with a focus on difficulty with a big emphasis on being prepared. The closest thing I've come is Elder Scrolls games that are heavily modded. I'm wondering if there's anything like this?

950,Hi there I'm currently a CE student trying to learn as much as possible about GPU design. My school provides an intro course in electric and electronic circuits  VLSI design  digital system design  embedded systems  computer architecture  and so on. But unfortunately there is no ASIC design course. So the real question is considering I've passed all courses above how far am I from being an actual GPU designer???

Is there systems where players create several characters so they can die several times ?   Thanks!"

954,Hi! So I started a new job this year that had me working wayyy too much so I really havent watched much anime from 2021. Before this job I was a 15-25 anime a season weeb for years. Feel really left out of the loop now. I quit that awful job and want to ask Reddits opinion of what I need to watch from this year. Wether its just really popular or really good Ill read all recommendations and start watching from there thanks for anyone who replies!
955,Hi. Im going to get my newnext week. Since it will be brand new im pretty concerned about break in period of a new engine. Ive heard it typically takes around 1500 km to do it. I know that i cant push the car hard etc but what concerns me is that i do 2km trip twice a day to work which is not ideal since the engine will be most likely still cold. How much km should i add to my trip to make it safe during this time? At what mileage can i continue my normal travel length? Or should i just dont care too much and just do a few longer break in trips in the meantime?
956,Hiyori is mega adorable.  That aside  I have a soft spot for ridiculous settings like this being played completely straight  so I'm enjoying myself pretty greatly thus far. If the show keeps this momentum up  I'm gonna love it.
957,"Hmm  if you count Starfinder as rules-medium  I think the setting offers some goofy stuff. If not  you can plunder the lore and use Savage Worlds  Everywhen or another generic system instead. As a fan of Barbarians of Lemuria  Barbarians of the Aftermath is a post-apoc game you can use for sci-fi and there is a fanmade hack called ""Barbarians of the Void.""  Something else I'd look into for goofiness is adapting the narrative dice from FFG's Genesys for extra shenanigans."
958,Hmm....  I take a much more laid back approach to all that.  I do watch stuff and think - that might be a good thing for a RPG thing.  But  I don't take notes or anything.  Some of those ideas fall by the wayside  but not all.  And I watch all sorts of things that wouldn't work for RPGs.  Also  a lot of RPG stuff I've run has zero to do with any kind of media.  Actually  most of it.  Actually  I'm struggling to think of many times I've actually used those ideas I thought of via media in an actual session  though I have those thoughts.  I wish I had pointers for those suffering like that  but I don't.  I don't get that far into either thing and just enjoy them for what they are.
959,Holy crap the Intellivison. I remember playing on the original one when I was a kid. If you think this one looks like crap. Look at the one I used this isnt mine but it is the exact same one of the time. LMAO        https://imgur.com/gallery/nkgpYtc
960,"Holy fuck i thought i was going crazy when i was explaining how my MSI laptop running win10 ""wakes itself up "" while on battery in the bag and overheats the whole bag while ending up at 0% battery in the morning."
961,Holy hell are parts of this thread toxic as fuck. I do find it funny how many of you cant handle the small dick energy of a subcompact car though. Its sad how you cant help but exhibit your lack of self-esteem by making fun of a perfectly fine car. No  the (base) Yaris is not nice  or fast  or beautiful. It is excellent at fulfilling the role of an automobile though.
962,Holy shit  good for them. Bout time manufacturers start making cars as efficient as the '90s again. Can't help but wonder if it can hit 60 under 9 seconds though.  It's starting to check my boxes...  - Handsome styling  check.  - Still offers a manual  check.  - Excellent mpg  check.  - Under $20 000  check.  Guess the only unknown is will it be reasonably reliable?
963,Honestly  almost none of the classics need to be remade. Remaster? Sure  as long as they preserve the feel of the original. But remakes tend to change so many aspects of a game that the original flavor is lost.   Id be more interested in seeing remakes of games that *werent* very good to begin with. A remake of a flawed game has the potential to correct the mistakes of the past  whereas a remake of a classic is almost always doomed to live in the shadow of the original.
964,"Honestly  based on this...  >By ""good pacing""  I mean I want it to have a strong start and not too much downtime in the main quest. I want it to feel like the story is getting somewhere and my party isn't useless until they reach level X or get Y amount of money. I would prefer not to spend 40 minutes in exposition dumps or talking to everyone in town for the one NPC who will let me out of town.  ...you probably aren't gonna enjoy many retro RPGs. I mean  talking to everybody in town to figure out how to progress is so common that it's literally a clich. What you should be looking for is an RPG with more modern design elements since based on your own description of likes and dislikes you'd almost certainly not enjoy most retro RPGs. Or if you absolutely want to try something old-school then maybe something more mechanically simple would be more your style.  All that considered  I recommend the Pokmon series. Anything from the GBA games onward hold up really well but the DS games are where the series stopped vastly changing the mechanics so if mechanical synchronicity throughout multiple games is important than maybe start there."
965,"Honestly  I didn't start with D&D  so I already knew there was ""other stuff"" out there. I spent years on 3.5/PF  shoehorning a bunch of stuff I liked into the game without considering whether it'd work. Then I stumbled upon pbta design and one-page minigames  as well as FFG's narrative dice systems  and realized that I wanted systems with personality. I am VERY much a person who wants to play and learn different games all the time. Once I became aware of this  I could no longer go back to D&D  except maybe 4e or Moldvay (which are focused games)."
966,Honestly  I'd play any of the other Masquerade editions. I wasn't overly impressed by the 5th when I looked at it. Far as the sexuality  like any other game you can cut that aspect out if you want to (and I personally think it's overplayed by a lot of STs and players who are looking for permission  rather than just strictly following canon).  My preference is Vampire: The Requiem  the New World of Darkness/Chronicles of Darkness re-imagining. I think it fixes a lot of the mechanical issues of the older edition  and would be easier to switch to without much of a learning curve if you're familiar with Masquerade in general.
967,Honestly  it totally depends on the game. I believe some games like Final Fantasy refer to it as Jobs  wile other games like Baldur's Gate (or any D&D style game) refer to them as classes.   Normally  a class defines a skillset and sometimes gear that is available to a PC as they advance. In Final Fantasy I think it is basically the same with jobs. Like u/Dymdez pointed out  usually switching between 'jobs' is more fluid  while games that label them 'classes' are more of a long term locked in choice.   The other point of confusion might be in using the term 'job' as a synonym for task or mission  or as your paid position. Like  you are hired to guard a caravan  so your 'job' is caravan guard regardless of your class.   Again  the terminology varies greatly from game to game  and there is not really a fixed definition for either of those terms across the board.
968,Honestly  P/S A/S 4s are just noisy. And that's when new  I assume they will get louder over time like every other tire. Michelin made a flagship tire that isn't at the top of the class for the first time in a long time. The noise and ride quality of that tire are mid pack at best.
969,"Honestly  setting games in your hometown is a great idea. It's all part of my rule of thumb ""run what you know.""   You know the areas  the history  the local legends  the interesting places. You know the culture  the people  the set pieces  the nooks and crannies. That is fertile  amazing stuff to draw on and build off of.   People who haven't run games set in their home towns are honestly missing out. It's a great time. We ran a whole series of games of [the contract](https://www.thecontractrpg.com/) in our hometown and everyone had a blast."
970,Honestly depends on the car  but not for ever no you could just extend the full service interval to say 20kk again depending on the particular engine.  Also if you car is doing this  use regular oil do not use synthetic or semi-synthetic if you're burning significant amounts of oil
971,Honestly I am just curious to see how it works out.  I have had bad ... very bad experiences with WELL ESTABLISHED unions that tend to be self important and not really care about the people...just the union  We shall see. I bet they will be great  until 1/5th are simply let go because they cant be paid effectively since the other 4/5 took their pay.  I will sit on the sideline and watch
972,Honestly I am so happy this has validated what I have been arguing on reddit for years.  For some reason  particuarly gaming subreddit  have got it into their head that for a digital connection  the cable does not matter. Which is absolutely false. For everyday  content well within the rated stats of the interface  sure  you are not likely to run into problems.  When I got into monitor overclocking  particuarly korean monitors that could be pushed really far beyond spec  using Custom Resolution Utility  it became very clear that once you started getting up to near the top of a interfaces rated bandwidth and pushing timings  shitty cables failed. Flat out. I ended up sharing cable on forums with other overclockers and I ended up with a collection of 'good' cable for overclocking but I never had a legit was of testing them aside from trying each one and pushing the bandwidth up smidge by smidge.
973,Honestly it's weird  but since my first car I've always bought a stuffed animal for every car (I refer to it as the car's spirit animal). The stuffed animal never leaves the car until I get rid of it. This allows me to always keep the memories since I associate the animal with the vehicle...I have 4 stuffed animals riding around in my current vehicle and some think it's weird  but I know quite a few people that have started doing it too.  Edit: Just to be clear 4 riding with me - 1 for each vehicle I've owned
974,Honestly kind of in a 2d kick now but idk if there's any neato 3d ones out there that look promising either. Say the next 6months or so? What are yall looking forward to?  Kinda curious about switch mainly but steam is cool also. And of course ps/xbox and w/e else are welcome for others. Just a thread to share what you're looking forward to and possibly help others in looking forward to other games  Currently on my radar  Triangle strategy (srpg)  Labyrinth of Galleria (drpg)  Sea of stars   chained echoes  eiyuden chronicles (2d classic rpg)  Debating on advance wars
975,Honestly Miru Tights really got me into Tights and Yuragi-sou no Yuuna-San really got me into Nekomimi.  As for more Animes with your style of fetish? Highschool DXD  Okusama ga saitokaichou  Highschool of the dead  Nande koko ni Sensei ga!?  Zero No Tsukaima are the only ones I can really remember
976,Honestly none  I didn't watch too much anime before I was 16 but I'm 21 now and literally nothing I considered good at 16 is now suddenly bad.  If anything there were some shows I dropped back then (Log Horizon  Konosuba  Re:Zero are the prime examples) that I really like now  but I never had the opposite happen.
977,"Honestly stoked for another control game  but kinda worried that they're giving it a ""bigger budget"". To me that just screams they're over-excited about it and try to put too much shit in it that doesn't need to be in there. I swear to FUCKING God if the trailer comes out and it's ""open world"" I'm never playing it. They need to make another one  but stick to the exact same formula with a few tweaks as this one. Everything about it was perfect  no need to ""add"" unnecessary things to it."
978,"Honestly?  It caused me one too many inconveniencies.    The final straw for me  was having to push it into a barn to warm up overnight  and having it suddenly work again.  It just made it clear to me that if i didn't have a heated barn to push it into...it wasn't going to be a sustainable thing anymore.  So i moved on.  But i honestly still wish i had that car.  I love my current car that replaced it.  But that car was special too.  I want both.  I wish there was a weird ""buyback"" option on used car sales."
979,Honestly? I'd recommend anyone's first game to be as simple as:  * Computer randomly picks a number between 1-100 * Player must repeatedly try to guess the number * Player gets points for how fast they can guess * Computer gives hints when the player is wrong  Programming is hard. Game development is hard. Start simpler than you could ever imagine and you'll still probably be challenged. Think of it this way  if it turns out it was easy for you  then you probably didn't waste much time anyway.
980,Hope its not the same devs who made the SJW piece of crap that was the last Wolf game. What a fuck up. The previous games were awesome - really good and that last one... just completely missed the point.
981,How about mirrors? You can't see the ghost normally  but you can see it in a mirror. That's a classic method for revealing supernatural things in stories  so the players should be able to pick up on it pretty fast.
982,How are you with difficulty? SaGa could fit  but while these games are not grindy they sure as hell are tough.  Maybe Breath of Fire or Lufia? Both only start getting good with game 2 however  so they are not that consistent.   I am a big fan of Final Fantasy Tactics Advance and Advance II  and they are much easier than Wrath of the Lions aswell.
983,How can you call yourself a journalist and write such blatant BS? I like Porsche as much as the next guy  but why on earth would you compare sales numbers of cars where one of them wasn't even in production for over half of the timeframe you are reporting on and then not even mention that fact in the damn article?
984,"How can you not read the Manga? don't call yourself a fan of X like I watch it for entertainment and not to fucking marry it  ""what's the best anime?why is it not X?"" sorry I forgot my tier list with over 1.000.000.000.000 animes I watched and that your taste is the only one that counts.  ""how can you not like X? Its so good"" maybe because we don't share the same taste and I'm in pain while I watch this shit?"
985,How did it feel when you realized the Chinese company had reverse engineered your game? Were you worried about them or someone else stealing it and uploading it under a different name? What protections did you take to avoid that  did you trademark it in China before working with them?
986,How do games with Steal Mechanic like skyrim for example keep track of stolen item while stacking them on top of normal item?  does it use Separate container for stolen item  does items stack in the container or just on the ui?  i normally add an entry of the item and increase an amount variable  but what if each item had a different health how do i store them?
987,How do I become a game developer?   This is one of the questions I have been asked most often in recent years.  On the other hand  it is a bit like the dream of every boy who grows up  to continue working in that fantastic world of video games.   And since there is so much to say  I wrote a long article where you can find a lot of advice accumulated over the last 10 years in the sector plus 2 years as founder of a gaming company.  As well as my personal experience so you can start taking steps in the right direction and hopefully find your dream job.   Link to the article: [https://blog.gladiogames.com/all-posts/how-to-become-a-game-developer-tips-after-10-years-as-a-developer](https://blog.gladiogames.com/all-posts/how-to-become-a-game-developer-tips-after-10-years-as-a-developer)  I hope that you can find some useful tips in the article. 
988,How do you develop a sound system like the one seen in Thief: The Dark Project and it's sequel? Where the sound of an object increases or decreases based on it's location from the player  and where the size of the room and the objects inside determine how far sound travels and echoes.
989,How do you feel about MMOs? FF14 requires focus when doing content for the first time or watching story scenes  but doing dungeon roulettes or grinding up a new alt job is perfect for zoning out and putting a podcast on IMO
990,How does this compare to GDDR6X. I always hear about HBM superiority   and it must be so   seeing as the A100 uses HBM   however the bandwidth of HBM3 Next is in line with 384 bit bus   19-21 gbps GDDR6X   is it not?  What makes HBM superior in that case? IO performance? I don't really know.
991,How exactly was the multimeter set up? For measuring current  were you using test leads or the clamp (I forget what it is called)? If using test leads you need to lift a lead and have the meter in series  like remove  the negative terminal and have one lead from the meter connected to the battery terminal and the other lead to the negative lead.   Generators (alternators in this case) generally do not put out a constant current (there are constant current generators but that is another discussion) they do their best to maintain a constant voltage and supply the current needed by the load. So if you did your test again and cranked up the fan  turned on the lights and window heat/defogger you should see the current you are measuring change.
992,How is this any different to the proven market model of Nvidia with their Quadro or amd? They sell the 'same' silicon with extra software features (like extra validation or optimisation paths) at a higher price?  If we accept one surely we must accept the other?
993,How long has this been a problem? If it's been long enough to research this product  then probably a while  in which case my suggestion probably won't be applicable  but... could your problem be the battery?
994,How much do you think cutting the cache die size is going to save?  Ian from Anandtech has done a [video on wafer costs](https://youtu.be/tvVobTtgss0?t=800) this year and even the highest price for 7nm wafers he's heard of ($14k) leads to less than $10 in raw cost for the 36mm2 cache die. Packaging costs will be very similar as you have to bond the same number of dies (maybe slightly higher yield with less TSVs).
995,How much playtesting have you done with other people? If you're running sessions where your players love the game and ask you when they can buy it  you're ready for release. If you test the game and people are confused and not enjoying themselves  you're not. Big studios do exactly that but with a lot more analytics  but that's essentially the best way to know.  Everything else depends on why you're building the game. If this is a fun hobby then release it whenever. If you're trying to make this a commercial success you release it when it's good enough to sell and you've built up a substantial marketing campaign. There's plenty of room between those as well - and also beyond into what makes a AAA game ready for release or not.
996,How those background services are destroying the 1% lows. The proprietary hardware is something but hot damn that software experience is horrible. If this is what people are picking up at Walmart and BestBuy  no wonder these OEMs/SIs are driving people to Apple products.
997,How to do _anything_ in game development  including conduct a playtest  depends on your goals. Why do you need a beta for this game? Is it to get essentially crowd-sourced QA  having people find issues in a game that's too large for you to test? Is it more to get qualitative feedback on what features or mechanics work  what characters/weapons are best  or what levels are too difficult? Is it to build awareness as part of a marketing campaign? These are different goals and it's always good to have a primary objective in mind.  Crowd-funding  as a separate topic  is for when you already have a community. It won't help you build one. If you're expecting a conversion rate of followers to backers of  say  10% and your cheapest 'full game' tier is 20 that means you'd want something like 5k followers before you launch to be completely safe. You really need to do a lot of marketing before launching a campaign because nothing kills a kickstarter like passing a few days and not being above a couple percentage points funded.  Both scenarios involve getting people to know about your game first if you're not planning on acquiring paid traffic (and if you _don't_ have a marketing budget  make sure you're not realistically expecting to earn anything either). When you use social media like Twitter make sure you're always building your following. Participate in other conversations with popular hashtags to get followers and tweet about your game separately. Release exciting gifs and short videos. Buy ads. Get views on your game. When you have enough followers in multiple channels then you can advertise a test or a crowdfunding campaign to them.
998,However  I honestly recommend going gridless and using 3d models (if you can). I recently discovered 3d gridless maps work great if you treat 1 inch as 5 ft (or 1 meter depending upon the system). Just have a tape measure and a laser line handy.
999,"https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Harvey_(1950_film)  https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Harvey_(1996_film)  https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Harvey_(play)  Trick is  it should feel like it may just be real after all.. Like the player couldn't rule out the DM might just turn around to the troupe and say "" and what about the rest of you?  you see it too"".  Tyvm"
1000,"https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_angels_in_theology  There are a bunch of great pages  regarding ""angels in the bible Wikipedia"" as a Google search  my recommendation  is not only download them as a Pdf  via the button at the top  but check out the references  some of them are very good  and are written by the most respected of academics.  https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Christian_angelology  Tyvm"
1001,"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Category:Villages_in_England_by_county  This list of English counties fits the bill but is pretty generic.  Go into each county for a list of villages however and you end up with some much more fantastical names like ""Alderwasley"" or ""Grindleford"""
1002,https://imgur.com/a/ycWCaKB  What is this lol?  Also  per my prior comment before that thread was deleted:  > It's surprising that two severe bugs squeezed past both AMD and Microsoft's QA teams.  Is it that surprising  though?  Seriously  both teams should have caught this. It's not malicious at all and likely the result of a fork in teams responsible from Win10 stable and Win11 development.. But how was this not caught during QA on AMD's side at least?
1003,https://ngabbs.com/read.php?tid=28944858  (See screenshots on page 2) According to the same reviewer  the 12900k beats 5950x by at least 50fs in CSGO. The screenshots above even suggests a 100fs gap. Then again  take a large grain of salt of this  nothing is set in stone yet.
1004,https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/shut-down-sleep-or-hibernate-your-pc-2941d165-7d0a-a5e8-c5ad-8c972e8e6eff  >Use sleep when youre going to be away from your PC for just a little whilelike when youre taking a coffee break.  >Use hibernation when you know that you won't use your laptop or tablet for an extended period and won't have an opportunity to charge the battery during that time.  IMO they should've just added a new option  'Rest'  which would be the current 'Sleep' setting. Rest>Sleep>Hibernate.   Because the changes do have valid reasons  but without informing customers and just changing how sleep works it's going to create issues.
1005,"https://www.amazon.com/dp/B06XFN6ZGD/ref=cm_sw_r_apan_glt_fabc_QVRJ6GA06WFEZKB18SVE?_encoding=UTF8&psc=1 This mat is great as long as you use 1 inch bases  I personally have this one: Chessex Reversible Battlemat  1"" https://www.amazon.com/dp/B00IVF4W0U/ref=cm_sw_r_apan_glt_fabc_3Z6GT9WKZ1B151V8W71Z?_encoding=UTF8&psc=1"
1006,Huh  for some reason I thought that they could only put 3 participants in the ranked match  but it looks like they can participate as a whole team. I was worried before  but now it seems like they've got a real shot at winning this.  I wonder how will they make Chika shoot people. She's gonna be a nightmare to handle  once she deals with her unwillingness to shoot people.
1007,Hybrid classes with magic.  Like a Paladin with holy magic  or an archer with elemental arrows  or a thief with shadow magic. It is very hard for me to do a pure class  and if I get the chance  I always end up mixing even if its not optimal  just because I find it much more fun and less repetitive.
1008,Hyundai head lamps. Not a fan of what they did with the badge on the grill  otherwise the back looks stunning.  Unfortunately Ford moved most buttons to the screens which I don't really like. My '19 Focus is great  and I'm sure this one will be great to drive as well.
1009,I  love Arkane games  but Deathloop's release was a buggy mess. I see how  Deathloop now has low quantity of players now. Deathloop's original idea  was ruined by it's low quality. And because new Vampire the Masquarade  Battle Royale game is giving to Arkane more profit  this means that we  will never see any innovation in AAA segment.  Now only indies have balls to make innovation.
1010,I  need to install bitarray (pip) to use web3 in python. But my laptop doesn't  have enough storage to install Visual Studio C++ specifically  BuildTools. I read somewhere that you just need a C++ compiler to  install bitarray so I tried downloading DevC++ (which I had enough storage for) and adding its directory to the PATH. But bitarray download  still fails.  I have a server that  has enough space and has properly installed web3 and brownie. I tried  copying the install folder of Build Tools to a networked drive and then  adding that location to the PATH but bitarray download still fails.  Does  anyone know what I can do to make this work? I can use web3 on the  server but it would be much easier to not have to toggle to the server  every time I want to compile.
1011,I *liked* cars as a kid  casually. When I was in college the ol file share of pirated stuff had a game called Need for Speed Most Wanted that I grabbed on a lark. That game changed everything. Did I only get it because Brooke Burke was on the cover? Maybe. But now cars were cool  customizable  and racing on the street.   The first pink slip boss you beat in that game drives this tricked out Cayman with flames. I adore that thing and I still need to get a Cayman one of these days.
1012,I absolutely hate when people try to give me unset expectations because they watched ahead when they ask if I've watched an anime  or 'gotten to X arc yet'. 'OH MAN THIS IS GUNNA BE SO GOOD' 'SHIT IS ABOUT TO GO DOWN NEXT EPISODE' etc... It's even worse when they try to justify their actions by saying how it 'wasn't  even spoiling'.
1013,"I actually do like it  but I'm probably in the minority of gamers. I personally get more anticipation from knowing what's coming soon than from atmosphere ques that I often miss. I'm kinda that dumbass that just wanders blindly springing any trap ahead if I'm not aware of what I should be afraid of. I also miss story important things a lot. I played the witcher 3 and it introduced me to the witcher. At no point in the decision making did I have any fucking idea what was going on. It did make for some funny moments  like when i got ""cook the baby"" as an option and i thought ""fuck it  why not?"" But the second time I'm playing the witcher 3 (current run) I'm coming into it having read the entire book series  and I enjoy the game so much more. I know the characters  I have pre-existing opinions when I'm forced to choose between them. I know the setting  I know the characters  I know the atmosphere  it's just all around like it's a different  much better game. I may be in the minority but i absolutely prefer a game set in an established universe.  Edit: I also skipped most side quests playing witcher 3 blind  and going in learned I do every side quest the second it pops up. A lot of players breeze past sidequest-locking milestones because they're curious about the main story  not because they want the story to advance  but because they want *world lore*  Edit 2: just realised this sub is about tabletops  sorry chooms"
1014,I actually have a similar experience with Odyssey at the moment although I do like the story. The only AC I really ever played was the first one on release and never finished it. Fast forward to 2021 where I recently discovered Origins and quite enjoyed it. A few months later I picked up Odyssey and honestly I am almost fed up with it. It started well enough but I keep ending up in situations where I am about 5 levels below the main quest. Grinding was OK at the beginning of the game but honestly has become annoying when in the level 20s...I just want to finish the story! If I recall correctly  this did not happen in Origins or at least not as bad or frequently  maybe on or two levels higher than where I currently was at.  I have seen a few posts on Odyssey about this but thought maybe the original poster did not like the type of game and was just hating on it but after playing it  man can I now relate! I am around level 28 with Kassandra  just met with her father and have not played it for over a week since. I don't play a lot of open world games or at least not frequently but this time I did feel a little burnt out with this game. It was a few months in between but maybe I played Odyssey too soon after Origins.
1015,I actually like it when done well.  Phantasy Star 4 has characters come and go over the course of the game  and you can pick your 5th party member when going into the home stretch.      In Grandia  there are several party members who leave the party forever because they have other matters to take care of  but you can transfer all their weapon and magic EXP to your other party members. So it feels like your characters learned something and the good times together stayed with them.
1016,I actually like it. I'm very monotone when playing  so most of the time I end up always using the first few party members. forcing them to get out of party actually gives me an excuse to explore other party members that I would otherwise neglect. my problem is if the party member comes back and they end up underleveled  if the game is grindy in level up department. that's two if's  but otherwise I'm cool with it.
1017,I agree that the game itself isn't doing you any favors  nor is the rest of the games listed under the developer on Steam. You've got a _very_ poorly reviewed Half-Life game  some small games without many/any reviews  and another game that's been in Early Access for three years. Not big selling points. I'd also say that if your messages were written in the same style as this post they likely would have been ignored as unprofessional.  Ultimately  streamers and content creators play games that will get them clicks. If your game isn't hyped enough that their audience would know about it (I can't even _find_ it on Twitter)  why would they spend their time on it? How's it going to help them? You have to already be getting some awareness to be worth it for them. That or deliver something truly novel  and right now your game trailer makes it look like every other crafting game except with a somewhat miserably brown filter over everything. It's not exactly endearing art direction.  If you're not an immediate value add for them then you get influencer coverage the same way you get any other marketing coverage: you pay them. There should be information on sponsorships for most people  or you can contact them directly. Don't expect it to be cheap if you want substantial coverage.
1018,"I agree with there being a very specific definition of what RPGs are  but the argument is a losing battle that always devolves into people refuting any logical point with either ""well  you play a role"" or ""rPg ElEmEnTs ArE vAlId"" and Reddit isn't a community that's full of critical thinkers or people who like to speak in absolutes because they fear empty  petty  anonymous internet downvotes.  Keep fighting the good fight despite the downvotes  OP.  Categorizing things appropriately and reminding people that solid lines for definitions **do** exist despite their willful ignorance isn't gatekeeping or exclusionary no matter how loudly the masses screech."
1019,I almost always like playing some kind of an up-close melee fighter. I tend to prefer Barbarian types  but in practice I think I like anything that lets me get up close and personal with blades.  I'm not really this way when I'm playing a tabletop game  where I don't think I have one favorite.
1020,I also have a tendency to rathole into a hobby until I get completely burnt out on it but your situation sounds much more serious. If you can will it I would suggest trying to take a vacation and doing something physical - play a sport or go hiking. Take a break from the hobby.  Stop running for a while and disconnect from RPG media (Reddit  YouTube and where ever else you consume it).
1021,"I also have two kids in the same age and I'm homebrewing a system because we seem to have very special needs. It is kind of between Hero Kids and Savage Worlds.  * We need ""stuff"" on the table because theater-of-mind is not sufficient: Paper miniatures  drawings ala ICRPG  a set of dice for everybody  bennies ala Savage Worlds  character sheets to colorize from Hero Kids * I'm trying to get a campaign going to create a richer world but we only have two sessions so far. We might go back to one-shots again. * I intentionally avoid the murder-hobo style stuff (which includes many Hero Kids adventures) so we have few fights. The last session was a chase of goblin thieves  so their giant dragon friend could quench a vulcano. * Coming up with adventures is my main struggle. One the one hand  they want me (as GM) to bring it but on the other hand  they are so much more imaginative then I am. * Maybe the most important part is me acting as NPCs in hilarious ways. Using different voices is my primary tool."
1022,I also started in web development. But I think I learned a lot in web dev that I was able to apply to gamedev. Yes  it's hard. But just think about how much easier it is for you already having some programming experience vs. someone with none.
1023,I also wanted to mention some unknown gems like spiderweb software's games. There made by one guy alot of them are alike and use the same engine but there really engaging.  Also really cheap too on steam.  Also its not mentioned but I would say ultima 7 could fit the bill  I think its the best one.  That's the only rpg that I've played in all the years that was truly free-form in that you can literally do anything you wanted and have consequences also it can be very overwhelming at first but once you get into it  its very satisfying.
1024,I always gawk over various cases when Im planning a build  but at the end of the day I always end up with a boring black fractal tower  theyre just so practical and reliable  edit: realized I said practical twice and it sounded dumb  but maybe it drives the point home
1025,I always have all players do character creation together at the same table during session zero. That way everyone can discuss their plans and make characters with backstories that work and mesh together.  Right now  you're suspicious  but have no proof. It *could* feasibly just be lucky rolling. I suggest just keeping a close eye on the next one. But for now there's no reason not to just carry on and enjoy the game.
1026,I always really enjoyed driving  but was never really interested in cars until about a year or so ago. My dad's 5-speed Integra growing up made we want to learn stick  and last year I was trying to find a family car in stick and it was a pain to find  but research and test drives and Top Gear and podcasts all hooked me in. I started trying to find ways to get into more and more cars  and every time I get out of a new car  I'm just itching to learn more and get into another one. I started writing and eventually YouTube  and I'm always looking for new experiences. Definitely still have a ton to learn about cars  but I'm always looking for more ways to learn and grow and experience more cars! I'm starting to discover the car community now as well  and really enjoying meeting people!
1027,I always thought Guts works in his fiction like how a D&D 3.5 fighter plays. Tons of HP  can slay mighty demons/gods  can't jump very high.  Guts also scales really hard with a magic sword and then with magic armor. His most iconic abilities are Cleave and Power Attack (or Vital Strike for Pathfinder fans).
1028,I am 41. No problems here. Of course I am not afraid to branch out and try new stuff which probably helps.  I've got a group playing FFG Star Wars that spans from me  the oldest at 41  to 26  the youngest.  My other group is smaller  I'm the second oldest  and the youngest is also mid-20's. We are doing D&D 5e now  but I'll probably run one of another dozen game systems I have when its my turn to DM.
1029,I am a game dev for 10 years and learning web is just as complicated. Frontend  Backend and hence many different languages and frameworks. Styles  Forms  security aspects  validation  shit that breaks on the server because it runs different Version of things that you do locally. Different Browsers (well that is getting more narrow these days). It's a lot to deal with. Nothing is easy when you just start out :)
1030,"I am a player in a campaign  that recently started playing in person again. During an out of character discussion at the table  the GM asked another player to roll a check. Noone was really paying attention  as the situation revolved more around that player and did not involve the rest of the group. Incidentally  i looked his way during rolling  while the DM checked his notes.  The player in question rolled  made a movement as if moving the dice closer to him  while toppling the dice over to a higher value. Noone except me noticed it. I kept a close look at him and caught him doing it again multiple times.  After the session  i was considering what to do. At the end  i decided against telling anyone or confronting the player. At the table  noone was having problems with his good roles. The table kept joking about his ""luck"" and his ""OP character""  but in a fun way. If i tell anyone  it wont change the table for the better. Confronting the player will only make him  me or both of us uncomfortable in the future.  Of course that's just my oppinion  every table differs. But i hope i can give you a different perspective."
1031,I am a web developer and I thought this wouldnt be a big leap for me to make. Ive been trying to make a simple basic game for months now and I just can not do it.  Tonight I almost broke my laptop because Im just so fed up with hitting dead ends.  Web is so much easier to get into and make a career with. Working on a game makes me feel like a total failure.  I have an insane amount of respect for anyone who can complete even the most basic game. This shit is ***hard***.
1032,"I am about to hit 1 000 hours on Sombra in of course Overwatch. I'm 43. Legacy of the Ancients on the c64  Wizardry and Legacy of the Ancients on same system  to the ""modern"" CRPG to all of our games now.  I'm a thief/rogue/shadow/etc. I legit switched from FFXI to wow because I was not going to get another ""job""   I won't switch. Lol"
1033,I am currently looking to buy an rpg for either Xbox or my Nintendo switch. What do you guys think is the best rpg game to play right now or if all time? Preferably western rpg. You can name several titles but preferably ones to play on xbox or switch.  Thank you in advance for your suggestions!
1034,I am finally starting to play Scarlet Nexus  then I found out there are two protagonist. According to some websites  the story seems important in both ends  and to see the whole story  it is better to start with Yuito and then move on to Kasane in a second playthrough.  Will it be okay if I just play both at the same time? One story mission each one  for example? Or just finish one story and then move on to New game Plus.  Just to clarify  I do not care about the trophies one can get  my focus in the gameplay and story  and both seem pretty solid in this game.
1035,I am guilty of this  but instead of making them move to new systems  I'm just constantly talking about the system du jour for me and suggesting that maybe we might play it.  My suggestion to you which I haven't implemented yet is this: wait for a lull in play  anytime a break from the routine is good  maybe when a player or two can't make it but everyone else wants to game... Suggest a one-off using a new system.  Do all the leg work beforehand  make it super easy for your players. Have pregens available; offer plenty from which to choose. Know the rules well enough to not require your players to know.  Just tell them what dice to roll and when and what modifiers apply. Make brief instructional side comments about the game mechanics here and there.  Basically  make it super easy for them to have the experience and just concentrate on making choices for their characters based on what they want to do and not based on game mechanics. You'll handle the game mechanics.
1036,I am in need of upgrading to a new laptop but am torn between which one to get. I am looking at the two models below but am can't determine which I should go for. Is it better to get a slightly older model with top of the line hardware or to get a more current model that isn't as top of the line. Both are intel chips.   2017 Macbook Pro with 16gb Ram  3.5GHz  500gb ($900)  or  2020 Macbook Pro with 8gb Ram  1.4GHz  256gb ($1000)
1037,I am looking for fantasy games that are set in the modern urban world or close to the modern world rather than medieval setting like Skyrim or Sci fi. Examples of such games would include Vampire The Masquerade: Bloodlines and Dishonored. Any Help would be appreciated.
1038,"I am new to C++ ""How to make a 3D game without a game engine?"" Dont. Your game and your will to ever even touch this industry will be dead before it ever reaches alpha unless you have a couple years and a will of steel to go from some tutorials to a working engine and game. Look into vulkan and master C++ if you dare. Vulkan is the easiest to scale cross platform  and is the best performing  but is not an easy one. Though this should feel a little more close to home if your learning C++."
1039,I am on my bed sleeping like a baby. I left my laptop open(locked screen) and speakers left on 20% voice. At 5.30 am it started blasting a techno song thro the speakers wich had a chorus. You're all alone. It scared the fuck out of me. How is that posible? I formatted the pc like a month ago. What Should I do?
1040,I am paying for a 300mbs internet plan from my provider but my pc is capping me at 100mbs. I have a cat6 brand new cable just installed 10 min ago and I am running with an ipv6 I used to get 250mbs download but now it is nowhere near that I think it's a setting on my PC that is throttling my speeds any help would be appreciated.
1041,I am playing breath of Fire 3 for psx and it is really something special  Also chrono cross for psx Ive enjoyed but only just started  Disgaea series for PSP looks like interesting tactics turn based  have played a little of the first one and seems cool  Final fantasy tactics game for NDS is great
1042,I am programmer by trade.  Game Dev is hard.  Some one said it below - but it's the scope.  Doing it solo also means  sounds  graphics  UI  AI  testing  just everything.  I have been working on the same basic shoot-em-up game for like 5 years.  I burnt the thing to the ground 3 times.  Changed from Unity to Godot to help reduce learning curve... Its hard.
1043,I am really curious though  how could it impact cache latency? I thought that cache latency was mainly dictated by hardware design? (my very little understanding is that cache is mostly handled transparently to software aside from some exceptions)   Hope that anyone knowledgeable could shed light on this.
1044,I am the opposite. My players are asking me to try new systems/settings  and I'm stuck with the few I got used too  because there is so much official and fan-fiction lore for them that I could run them to the end of days...
1045,I am working on an arcade style game  and I had a possibly good and equally diabolical idea of using currency to play the game.  As many might remember  in order to play an arcade game  you had to insert coins and play  and if you lost  you couldn't play until you got more coins.  I had an idea for a game which was basically that the game would start with a certain amount of coins you could use. However  if you had none left  you had to buy more in order to play.   If you beat the game  you not only had access to unlimited amount of coins forever  but you also had access to a bunch of different game modes  and extra features forever.  I'm undecided on whether to use fake currency that you can obtain by playing a included mini game of some sort  or use real currency that is a low amount  like a cent or something.  However  I wanted to know your thoughts on this idea in general.
1046,I am working on my UI  and despite my game being set in a power plant  I have no ideas what the objective UI image should be. I was thinking a beaker with green ooze pouring out  but I don't think that would be good. Any thoughts guys?
1047,I am working on what will be a fairly beefy compute shader  and my bottleneck seems to be the amount of data I am processing.  If I comment out every ounce of code  leaving only a simple copy from one buffer to the other  my execution time remains unchanged.  Cutting data from the dataset is the only reliable way to reduce it  and adding data increases it.  That is completely understandable as it is a lot of data.  So I wondered if I could get away with reduced precision--and if such a thing was even possible with a shader.  I searched  and hallelujah!  The `half` type!  Only  it seems like it is a lie.  As far as I can tell  it is identical to `float` in every single way.  When I dispatch to my shader  I even have to give it a `float`  with the exact same stride.  Am I doing something wrong  or is the `half` data type a lie?  Are there any reasonable alternatives?
1048,I am writing a fictional story that has a part involving cars  and I don't want the details to be laughable  is it possible to upgrade something like a 1987 Ford Mustang or Corvette C4 with an engine & parts that would rival the fastest cars? What might that look like?
1049,I am your age and I do have this problem.  If you're on the west coast we might be able to find a mutual solution.  I feel like DnD and Pathfinder have totally saturated gaming at the moment and finding people to play anything else is really tricky.
1050,I and many others love cold war era RPGs. However  I cannot too strongly recommend you getting an editor if the spelling and grammar of this kickstarter campaign is indicative of the final quality of the game. At the very least run the text through grammarly or spellcheck.
1051,I answered same question a while ago.  Heres the comment  https://www.reddit.com/r/hardware/comments/ohokr1/if_somone_wants_design_a_hardware_like_a_cpu_or_a/h4qhouf/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=ios_app&utm_name=iossmf&context=3
1052,I believe it was chapter 7 in xenoblade chronicles 2 that takes away one of your most powerful assets and thrusts you into a super difficult dungeon. Its an unfortunate blemish on (IN MY OPINION) a near perfect game.
1053,I believe 'miro' ( https://miro.com ) has been used by some for this purpose. I don't know any more than that. Can't remember where I saw the discussion.  UPDATE: if you search this sub for 'miro' you find a few hits. This one might be useful:    https://www.reddit.com/r/osr/comments/l32em8/miro_is_amazing_for_rpgs/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=ios_app&utm_name=iossmf
1054,I believe someone mentioned it already but buy additional backpacks at first opportunity. The merchant in ostagar has one.  Speaking of which this one is the last chance to stock up on healing items before going into the tower there. I recommend doing that.  Also listen to your companions dialogue. You can give them gifts to strengthen your bond. Which ones? Thats where the aforementioned listening comes in.
1055,I believe you just forgot the pitfalls you've encounter while trying to become a web developer. I sure remember  years ago being stuck in tutorial hell trying to even grasp Redux  today I use it with ease.  Practice is half of it  and also learning to scope a project I am sure you can build any web app you can think of now  but could you when you started?
1056,"I bet that the original version had the same ""security issues"" but nobody cared about them back then. Theses days too many ""security researcher"" are looking for a quick CVE number for things that nobody can really exploit."
1057,I bought a 95 Del Sol and it is incredibly loud with its 5 diameter exhaust. I appreciate the performance gain  but I cant stand that I cant even talk to my passengers without yelling. What muffler could I buy that would effectively quiet the exhaust system? What alternate solutions exist?
1058,I bought a jacked up 98 Cherokee XJ in 2003. I still own it but it got destroyed by hail last year. I still get offers on it every time I take it to the trails. Like legit offers.  Edit: I will add that my 16 Ram Sport Night (All black everything  Challenger hood) is selling for what I paid for it a few months old in 2017.  Also ended up with a 2015 Scion FR-S that I don't drive much. Coilovers  Wheels and exhaust. Paid 15k CDN in 2017 and haven't seen one sell for less with the mileage of mine. I don't plan on selling unless I come into the right V8 Manual for the right price  but I don't see that happening any time ever.
1059,I bought a new Holden Commodore in 2017 because I wanted one of the last ones  but I expected it to follow the usual off a cliff Commodore depreciation curve followed by an eventual slow climb.  Nope. Already worth more than new. I guess I knew I was buying an eventual classic but it turned out to be an instant one.
1060,I bought a Porsche 930 when they were worth about $35k and still have it. I also bought a first generation Ford Bronco around 1996 and still own it. The value of both of them has become absolutely insane.
1061,I bought a Subaru WRX hatch in world rally blue completely stock and everything. Did a Subaru thing and spun a rod bearing. Then bought a civic type r that will definitely be worth something in the future.
1062,I bought a Surface Book for like 2k a couple years ago and thought it would be a safe investment. After all  Microsoft ought to be able to make hardware that works with their software pretty well  right? Wrong. Worst piece of shit I've ever used. They even delisted it on Amazon so I couldn't leave a crappy review  so hopefully someone reads this and goes with another brand.
1063,I bought an Integra and a Boxster. Now the boxster is all electric and the new integra isn't the old one so I'm hoping they'll both be valuable one day. Or at least not lose much value.  You have to go in wanting something that cannot be replaced by today's technology.
1064,I bought and sold a beautiful 1985 FJ60 right before the market went ape shit for them. Could have easily gotten $10K more than I asked if I had waited about 5 months.  That one still hurts. Also had a 1977 Mercedes 6.9  should have kept that a little longer too. Fuck it  I'm just ahead of the curve.
1065,I bought my 2002 M3 in 2008. Kind of a car I planned on keeping for awhile. Now it will be celebrating its 20th birthday. Never thought it would become as desirable as it has. Its still my weekend therapyprobably driving it until I die.
1066,I bought my 3rd sw20 mr2 last year  my brother has been looking and apparently they all shot up in price right after I got mine. Fairly certain I could sell for 25-40% more than I paid if i wanted to get rid of it.
1067,I bought my manual 1995 e36 m3 in 2010 for 3 grand with 100k miles on the meter. Put a few grand in for a new engine rebuild and some tasteful mods  and now its sitting around 20k value. Not as big as other comments valuation but a real nice unknown investment.
1068,I bought the Mazda3 over the Civic. I agree about the backseat space but the Mazda matches my personality better and its still pretty fast haha. Also it was cheaper than the Civic I was building and has every single feature I wanted.
1069,I called a bunch of honda dealerships. Apparently  you can't even order a hatchback with a stick. You have to wait for the dealer to have an allocation or shop elsewhere for it. Such a weird omission. Honestly  was definitely crosshoping this and the maverick but not being able to get what I want and have to wait isn't worth it.
1070,I can agree to everything except bunny girl senpai  that anime felt perfect to me  and sakurasou didn't feel that bad  if they had continued then it could have been worse. I would add blast of tempest  this anime need more episodes  it just didn't feel well ending pretty quickly
1071,I can only imagine the three time is running out and something will happen when he turns 15 to them. Maybe they are purposely put there to raise and train him till he's a adult. Gus trying kill him could be gus trying to stop him hitting 15 so his time never runs out.   Had him collect money for when they are gone and he has to leave probably.
1072,I can say having some knowledge of C++ has made me more aware of why some things are the way they are in Unity/C#. You dont need to be an expert  just know your stuff.  You can teach yourself the exact same things they teach you in college (and get much more specific to your goals too)  it may just take a longer time depending on your approach.
1073,I can see how this form factor is better than a standard fold over 2-in-1 design  and obviously you can pack a little more muscle and cooling into this than the Surface Pro  but I think they might be better off just making a larger/thicker Surface Pro with a dGPU and better cooling.  The Surface Pro form factor has a number of advantages that the Surface Laptop Studio doesn't  like having the hot parts off your lap and propped up off the desk  being able to type on the keyboard and draw on the screen with the display tilted back.  Also its a small thing  but I really also like that the Surface Pro can be stood up with the stand deployed and the typecover closed and it takes up very little horizontal space on a table or desk.  Also for a person like  me  the typecover of the Surface Pro is still the most comfortable typing setup I have had for a mobile computer.  I think MS just needs to make their own version of the Asus ROG Mothership and that would have been better.
1074,I can sympathise with this. Im a web dev by trade now  having left the small dev company I worked for. I actually had the reverse experience and was shocked about how different game dev was from web dev. It just goes to show how different schools of programming are completely different jobs  with different required skill sets.
1075,"I can tell you one thing  I've never followed a game developer  publisher or a ""influencer"" on Twitter (actually  I've been off Twitter for 4 months now).  Majority of the time they post garbage content (esp. politics from their country  nobody cares outside  American devs do this a lot) and it's like subscribing willingly to an advertising network. This is why usually journalists   YouTubers or bloggers are the ones following those accounts.. IF they are interested or know you personally.  Also  this is why I find it hilarious when developers post shit from real life on their game related twitter  then get canceled by some twatty game journalist who got offended by developer's dog's skin color or their joke. Good luck dealing with all that.  If you are a solo dev  I suggest avoiding Twitter like places or fans  and stick to PR releases like in the good old days when people used to complain about ""no human contact"" between devs and players.  Twitter is for politics or generic personal life shite nobody but voyeurs care about."
1076,I can warmly recommend this. The English translation is brand new  but I have run the Finnish version with families that want to start a new TTRPG-hobby with very successful results. The game is just amazing. It is also fun to run. https://www.drivethrurpg.com/m/product/373356
1077,I can't believe how hard making a website is.  I am a game developer and I thought this wouldnt be a big leap for me to make. Ive been trying to make a simple basic website for months now and I just can not do it.        Tonight I almost broke my laptop because Im just so fed up with hitting dead ends.        Game dev is so much easier to get into and make a career with. Working on a website makes me feel like a total failure.        I have an insane amount of respect for anyone who can complete even the most basic website. This shit is hard.
1078,I can't help but feel as if Audi's RS division is a bit lost at the moment. Don't get me wrong  I love their cars and would probably choose them over the competitors because of their combination of style  performance  and comfort. But gone are the days of the special engines like the 4.2 NA V8  which could even be paired with a manual transmission. Now that the manuals and special engines are gone  what's left are the typical Audi problems of the engine hanging over the front axle and an AWD system that doesn't bias the rear enough for fun handling. These drawbacks always existed in Audi RS products but are now exacerbated by engines that lack character. (to be fair  the RS3 thankfully still has that incredible 5 Cyl)  I think Audi is fully committing to EVs and as a result isn't investing into their ICE engines  platforms  and transmissions to compete with M and AMG. That being said  I think the transition to EVs will strongly benefit Audi because they can finally compete on handling characteristics without an engine hanging over the front axle. Add to that Audi's incredible ability to provide performance without compromising comfort  and Audi RS EVs could be seriously promising.
1079,I cant imagine why youd need new coolant so quickly. Maybe on the brake fluid though. I would go with the owners manual unless you have a good reason to deviate. Are you sure it says the brakes are also 120k/10yr? That sounds crazy long to me. Many cars recommend 2-3 years.
1080,I can't speak of Esoterrorist  but in Call of Cthulhu it sort of depends. Cultist people are people  and relatively easy to kill  but then so are your character investigators.  There are things that are around that are meant to be more harassing  these might be easy to more difficult... Not impossible to kill.  Then there are things which really aren't in the normal range of fighting against. Those cosmic horrors can be incredibly hard to kill. Possibly either close to impossible or even sometimes actually impossible by  any normal means.   Sometimes in horror you have to run if you don't have the exact answer. Sometimes  locking away the horror or making it run   is as much a success as killing it. Survival can be a success.   Call of Cthulhu generally makes even normal other humans often as easy to kill as your PC. Unless going with the Pulp rules  violence can easily be lethal. The same way it can be IRL.   Unlike D&D  you are a human investigator not a adventure hero. You are a normal person  not a mega-fighter. The game plays out accordingly... And remember there are many fates worse than death. You might not kill it  but it won't kill you either... You'll just wish it had.
1081,I can't tell you why  but I love when characters leave to rejoin at a later point and it's one big reason of why *FF IX* is one of my favorite games. I don't know  it's something I enjoy both narratively and from a gameplay perspective. Specially when they don't earn levels on their own while they are gone (I like having to train them to catch up).  Permanently losing a character is something I enjoy the first time and if it's unexpected. In my experience  when you permanently lose a character  you get something in return (more often than not  you get a new character that acts as a replacement).
1082,I could write a book on the GM Ecotec platform since I was obsessed with it as a teenager into my early 20s. They're great engines  I got 260whp out of my 2.2L and drove it like that for years with 0 major problems. But  once I totaled it and got my first Mustang I'll probably never touch one again. Still has a special place in my heart and I have nothing but good things to say about them but a RWD V8 platform changed how I think about fun cars completely
1083,"I definitely see how this can be heard that way.  Between two different ""guttural"" noises that we think Zombies would make... back to back the noises would be/are unfortunate.   The first noise is like ""Nyarrgh"" as if their mouth was closed and just started screaming or whatever you want to call it.  Then the ""Grrr"" happens following the primary ""scream"".  Everyone thats played zombie games can easily say that the first audio portion where the zombie goes ""Nyaarrgh"" is the quintessential noise to use when a Zombie is for the most part saying  ""Bitch  I see you.""     I remember this kind if clip occurring with zombies a few years ago.  Maybe Call of Duty?  Where the Zombies sounded like they may be saying that. But we all know that between all of the classic Zombie noises we have grown accustomed to  there are a few that are rather unfortunate when paired together.  Kinda like how a word in one language may be a curse in another.  We hear N-word  zombies hear ""Fooood. Kill."""
1084,I did my first track days this year and here are a few things I came away with:  - check brakes and tires. Make sure you have even basic sport brake pads  on-top of overheating daily driver pads can break off. Get dot 4 fluid. Makes sure your tires are in very good order  any gouges (even if they are fine to drive on the street) require you to rethink going to the track.   - watch YouTube videos that go over the track and the lines. This can save you 1-3 laps trying to get use to the track when you get there.  - you are going to suck  so don't push too hard. You are trying to get used to the track  your car at speed (that you need to drive home) and all of the other little things happening around you. Others will be driving cars they only drive at the track or have days of experience behind the wheel at speed.  A Miata/mini/BRZ will pass you (me in my 500 HP RWD car) and that's 110% ok  - learn from everyone. There are alot of older people who will give you free tips without hesitation  take it all in.  - if you plan to do this a lot  it costs a lot. This hobby isn't for the squeamish when it comes to cost. It has also ruined a fair number of marriages.
1085,I did not intend to buy a Suburban/Yukon XL but when I went to a dealer to look at another truck that wasn't the right fit  I saw my Yukon sitting in the corner  by itself. I asked to drive it  liked it  and had my mechanic look it over. He said it was in good shape but needed about 2 grand of work to make perfect. I went down to the dealer  offered then $1500 under asking  and they were almost too happy to sell the truck. I paid $4500 for it  with 127k miles. The kicker is that it's a 3/4 ton with the 6.0. The 8.1s are more desirable to most people  but I prefer the 6.0 for the aftermarket parts availability. 3/4 ton Suburbans are pretty rare and desired for their higher payload/towing capabilities and stouter drivetrains. I've spent about $3k to make mine perfect and I've had multiple offers to purchase it  or just people come up and talk about one they had or their parents had at one point.   On a road trip recently  I was getting gas (8mpg highway!) and someone came up and told me about how when he worked at the embassy in Iraq they had a couple uparmored Yukons just like mine. With the added payload and stiffer frames  the 3/4 tons were popular with military contractors because they could handle the armor and additional gear. They're sorta unique vehicles  from a unique time in history and there aren't any full-size SUVs with similar payload capabilities available nowadays. The only competitor that I know of on the market was the Ford Excursion  which command even higher prices for a clean example.
1086,"I did some quick analysis on this video: https://imgur.com/a/s8839Aq  After running a deblurring algorithm  the buttons by the shifter are labeled ""INDIVIDUAL""  ""Drive Mode""  ""\[Start-Stop symbol\] off""  electric parking brake  and ""BRAKE HOLD"".  The last 2 buttons seem similar to the Civic's but their shape is subtly different (so they're not sharing parts bin  especially for the shifter surround).  Not surprising but still fun to see."
1087,I did stock fog lights on my wife's Versa.  It's not hard once you figure out how they mount behind the fascia.  I think the hardest part about the wiring was routing the switch wires into the cabin as it was tightly sealed.  On Versa  however  the fog lights are activated by a separate button  not the turn signal stalk.  Because of that  I wired the fog lights on their own circuit.  I recommend you do the same because it is so simple and you don't risk screwing up the headlight/blinker switches.  I'd come off the battery +/- into a relay and out to the lights.  From the relay  I would run to a switch in the cabin and then to a wire that to a circuit that turns on/off with the ignition key.  That way when you turn the car off  the fog lights go off.    If you have a switch blank on your dash  I'd pop that out and put the switch in there.  If not  I'd get a mounting bracket and stick it to the bottom edge of the dash with double stick tape.  This is all clean and out of the way  and the only circuit you would have to splice into would be where you wire in your switch.
1088,I did this  and a year later my finances were fine. I should have refinanced instead. That said  our income was stable and the situation was a large one time large cost related to buying our house.  If your credit is good and this idea is suitable  you can probably talk to a credit union and get cash out and refinance the car at a term you like and a rate under 3%. Depreciation of your car is likely negligible for the next year  although adding a lot of miles would reduce resale value.  Anyway  selling it isnt the only option. And Mazda is still making them so if you decide selling is the best choice  make a plan about when youll expect to buy a new one before you go and sell it. Then youll have something to look forward to instead of just having something gone.
1089,I didnt buy them accidentally  I sold them accidentally. I had two Integra Type Rs (97 and 00)  an 04 S2000  a 98 4Runner and a CRX. Dumped the ITRs for 10k  the S2000 was a lease I had to pay to take back (buyout was 20k)  then 4Runner was actually in great shape  but dumped it for $100  and I gave the CRX to my brother. Missed out on an E30 M3 for 18k when I got the second ITR.   I made amazing purchases. I sold like an idiot.
1090,I didnt quite get really into cars until just before getting my license. I knew what cool cars were and I had some posters. I just never really paid too much attention since I couldnt drive.  Im the type of person that gets REALLY into hobbies. Since I had to study to get my license  I just kept reading more and more . My mom bought the s2000 brand new and I didn't really care that much at the time. Once I got into the hobby  I then realized the beautiful monster we had sitting in the garage.
1091,I didnt really get the whole RWD is better. FWD sucks. RWD is the only way thing until I actually bought a decent RWD car.   I think the balancing of the car and suspension all make a huge difference too but the power and sportiness of a RWD is noticeable from a FWD car. I do feel like a tiny bit special when I turn the steering wheel a little to tight and hit the gas a little too hard and feel the back wheels come out. You dont really get that with FWD.
1092,I didn't think my Toyota Soarer JZZ30 Series 3 with the 1JZ-VVTI would increase as much as it has recently. I bought it for under 10k AUD in 2011  and in it's current configuration/state you can't buy them now for anything less than 30k AUD.  And that's with the R154 manual  and mine has a MK4 Supra V160 6 speed in it  which makes it all that much more desirable.
1093,I do  one of the RuneQuest adventure books has several tables of rumours. I roll and then decide if they are true or not depending on how they sound.  It's also fun seeing which ones the player gravitate towards  and which ones the run from. :)
1094,I do 3D digital modeling (which I love) but I absolutely hate shaders and texturing my assets which sucks because it makes an object an object.  Other than that  it takes a while to make a model from scratch and optimized to a point of game ready.
1095,I do both  games and web. Games are harder  sure. But the basics are there even in web. Why don't you try a simple browser game? You do not need fancy engines to make a browser game.   Single page apps games are very common and you just need javascript for everything :)   Happy coding and do not be afraid to ask for help!
1096,I do exactly this with turn-based JRPGs! Because it's turn based  it's never a bad thing if you get distracted and look away from the game. Also the battles are often pretty low-stakes and low-difficulty.
1097,I do have a feeling that their requests for his coming of age is to free them from their undead bindings and be able to pass on to the next life. Basically  our mc may need to kill them.  It makes sense  because no one in their right mind will want to spend an eternity as an undead. If the reason for them being undead was to fight for something  I assume they've already accomplished the tasks long ago. They are now just waiting for someone to end them and be able to rest in peace.
1098,i do not have anything too special  but i drive both my old cars almost every nice day. they are both modified  my e30 just slightly and my mr2 is heavily  but i bought it with some and added my own and i love it. at the end of the day its your car  not the next guys  so why not do what you like with it?
1099,"I don't appreciate Doug talking shit about the regular Yaris for 20 minutes straight.  It was an affordable method of transportation and definitely had its place.   Too bad poor people have their expectations and self image warped by our hyper-capitalist culture  and concerned about these 6 000 lbs bro-dozers hitting them that should require a CDL to operate.  Ford just removed minimum credit scores for 84 month financing. People are going to end up paying thousands in interest because they can't afford these new vehicles.  The way the middle and lower classes are being squeezed is frankly appalling.  Edit  RCR said - ""show me someone who hates on the Yaris and I'll show you someone who scoffs at colorful sunsets.""  And that's why I still watch RCR."
1100,I don't change systems  but we do change campaign settings rather drastically each campaign.  The players like the changes each time because it is always new and different and they get to change up their characters to be different.
1101,I don't even care that I saw the movie already. It's just great to have demon slayer back again and experiencing it in an episodic format on the way to the entertainment district arc. I also think it's a great way for people who couldn't see the film in theaters during covid to see it in a way more accessible to them.
1102,I dont even know where to begin with how dumb of a statement that is.   A car could struggle if it werent able to get the wheels moving. But tires being too good is not what would cause that.   Unless they were tires made out of Spider-Mans skin and they grabbed the road so tightly they stopped the car from rolling them at all under low power
1103,I don't feel strongly about the trend per se.  Rather  I raise my eyebrows at anything trying to be a standalone game when it has a highly specific story with little room for expansion and/or a setting that I fan run in any generic game without even touching the extras or special powers section.    For instance  take Blade Runner.  I have not seen the sequel yet  but let's focus in the main film for now.  Does anything in that film require custom mechanics added onto  say  GURPS or FATE or GUMSHOE?  Replicants are on a timeline for their lifespan  but what does that do mechanically when the deadline isn't eminent?  Does the VK test require special rules?  At most I would need a generic setting guide and I could adapt to most systems that support a light cyberpunk setting.  Conversely: ATLA.  Even without the BENDING you have spirit world shenanigans  multiple potential eras of play  a vast bestiary  many cultures and organizations  and we haven't even left the original show.  And  due to the serialized nature  there are a wider rang eof themes  as well as deeper explorations of the central themes of honor  duty  family  and discovery  and those themes may well inspire specific mechanics.  Do I still need a new game for that? Not necessarily. But there's more there to justify a new game.
1104,I don't have a lot of time to play lengthy RPG's. I know there are a few that are under 20 hours of playtime. I'm looking for an RPG that's more episodic. I don't mind a longer overall storyline  but I'd like to be able to go through an episode in the game in about 2-3 hours. At least getting to a rest point where I don't have to remember a lot of things in the current quest since it could be a few days before I get back to it.
1105,I dont have a personal Twitter  but I just post tweets related to my game  and occasionally retweet other devs. I figure my followers are only interested in my game  so why clog up my feed with other stuff. Ive actually unfollowed some games I was interested in just because I couldnt stand their constant personal tweets.
1106,I don't have a rare or collector car  but I'd like to think I'd drive it if I did. Otherwise  what's the point? One client of ours has a collection of maybe 6 Shelby's  a 93 Cobra R  and a 2005 GT. He drives none of them and it makes me sad  he even said one of them he won't even take off the lift because it is too valuable.
1107,I dont have any hands on experience with it  but I like the styling of the Plymouth Prowler. Everything Ive read about it indicates its a Chrysler parts bin hodgepodge of a car glued together with mediocrity.
1108,I don't have friends in real life. And usually love to hang out online. I remember how I met with some amazing people in Minecraft. But is this possible to play DnD or Pathfinder online? I have Discord and maybe could do something.
1109,I don't have high hopes for this at all  Honda has produced utter shit for the past 15 years or so.   For them to revive a 90s nameplate without producing anything really compelling  and honestly doing the opposite (look at the sheer size of hew new civic!  it's a fucking accord!)  I'm not excited about this  and it reminds me of when GM revived the Malibu name and stuck it onto a total turd.     Hope to be proven wrong tho.
1110,I don't know about roguelites (maybe **Darkest Dungeon**?) but **Fallout: New Vegas** and **Vampire - The Masquerade: Bloodlines** are my usual suggestions. New Vegas is obviously an open world post apocalyptic game. Now the Bloodlines takes place in modern world (early 2000's) however the setting is rather dark and at times it feels like a light weight horror game.  If you want something rather different then the **Legend of Grimrock** might be worth of consideration. It's a dungeon crawler with puzzles and it takes place in a somewhat creepy dungeon.  **Dark Souls** games are also worth of consideration if you are interest in more action focused games and as the name suggest the games are thematically on the darker side.  Though both Souls and Grimrock aren't usually considered to be easy games.  I haven't played the game myself but a lot people swear by **Disco Elysium**  so it might be a good game if you are looking for a more narrative focused game.
1111,I don't know how to solve your problem for you. Most times I prefer sneaky or magical types. I usually pick one of the two and then  if I liked the game  make the other character when I replay it.  I think you're overthinking it. They're games. You're supposed to be having fun  not stressing out.
1112,"I don't know if DNN will ever be used to make cars that are ""99.999% safe to autodrive"" but I am quite sure there are still a great many applications for machine learning that haven't been fully explored. There is a  trend of new application discovery that leads to a mini-boom for that field that eventually leads to exhaustion of common case applications. That generally follows after data availability in at least a scrapeable format. That data's not there right now for many future popular applications.  There are also subtopics like GANs where it's been getting consistently better and better and it's only going to be more important as time passes  So I'd hold off on writing that obituary just yet. To quote Babylon 5  ""No boom today"""
1113,I don't know if I really have a Top 10 yet since it's only been 1-3 episodes for most anime. So far the main standouts for me have been Memempu and Gagumber from Sakugan  Biwa from Heike  Futaba from My Senpai is Annoying  and Bojji from Ranking of Kings.   But lots of potential across the board this season. Taisho Otome *could* do some interesting things with its characters. Not convinced it will  but we'll see. Irina also needs some kind of development  but I could see her being interesting.
1114,"I don't know if it was intentional but I find the main character hilarious. Anytime he puts his stupid hood up or starts his cringy edgelord dialogue  I start laughing. I think it's supposed to be cool.  Betting all his 'star chips"" is a great way to give no stakes to the match. Like I get he's the main character but at least the illusion he could lose would be nice before the match starts."
1115,I don't know if it's the most beautiful  but the DeLorean must be pretty high up there on the 'all looks  no substance' list.  The PRV V6 was gutless even for the day  and reliability was a problem even when brand new. Build quality was shocking even by the standards of the day  which wasn't a high bar.
1116,I don't know what to expect from playing it on a console  but they're a blast to play on the PC.   CRPGs are great to play on the PC because of mods and stuff. Like you can put in your own custom portraits or whatever. If you like messing around with that kind of stuff  and I personally do.  As you may know  D&D is based on a tabletop game. There is thick rulebook that governs what you can do (particularly in battle) and how  and you roll dice to determine outcomes. CRPG versions of D&D try to adapt those rules and dice-rolling into the game.   Just jump into it  man. You need to try it for yourself to know if you'd like it or not.
1117,I don't know who that guy is and I've never even seen any of his games  but the article was great. Bold  extreme opinions that spark a discussion  that's what we need  that's how you reach the truth. A few notes:  > Do not choose a bad genre  **...if you don't have a good artist**. If you have a good artist on board  you can sell a game in literally any genre. Undersaturated  oversaturated  dead  any.   > Use a name that describes the game.  That's just such an absolute  complete  utter  bullshit. All trashy games use self-descripting names. If you want to fit among Chinese clones of clones  go pick a name like The Quest for Legends of Heroes Dungeon Defenders Chronicles Saga  sure.
1118,I don't know why I didn't think of it sooner   Crimson Cutlass by Better Games  It is hard to describe as it is so fundamentally different from all other rpg's   a review [https://www.rpg.net/reviews/archive/classic/rev\_5225.phtml](https://www.rpg.net/reviews/archive/classic/rev_5225.phtml) hmm by one Infanger's Quest Clubbers.  I played with them a couple of times at the Los Angeles Conventions.   let's just say things happen fast in Cutlass.  You have to keep good notes and pay attention or you can get left far behind.  Don't worry the Ref can work you back in with the Digression Tables if you miss a session or two.   Sample from Cross Ships Assail pg 154  King Cross Assail: throw a grenade across ships and into the hold of the     opposing vessel where most of the defenders lay in wait. Success and opponents     round increases an extra point; more of them are dying. Difficulty: 12 Advantage:     Chiasmic Action\*       Queen Cross Assail: swing across to opposing mainmast  release grip  and     drop to trestletree. Optional  success and condition becomes Traverse Deck  but fail    and knocked unconscious in fall. If the player character lacks the skill Sailor      increase difficulty by three. Difficulty: 9 Advantage: Acrobat       Knight Cross Assail: swing and kick opponent off railing on the forecastle.     Optional  success and condition becomes Traverse Deck  but fail and fall into water.     In case it need be said  a character who cannot swim and falls in the water has     drowned and is dead. Difficulty: 7 Advantage: Effective Spurning\*       Knave Cross Assail: situation becomes confused  and the men start to falter.     Inspire them to continue or condition becomes Ships Separate. If the player character     lacks the skill Captain  increase difficulty by three. Difficulty: 7 Advantage: Lordly       Ten Cross Assail: hold fire until ships firmly lock together. At proper time     release volley of fire as opponents rise to repel board. Success and opponents round     increases an extra point; more of them are dying. Difficulty: 7 Advantage: Cunning
1119,"I don't like moral choice systems that devolve to ""be Santa"" or ""be Satan"".  You rarely get to do anything without getting pushed into one route or the other.  Undertale often gets lauded as a game where choices matter  but that's really only true to the extent that the evil route actually feels evil."
1120,"I don't mean just general areas where a character does not excel  such as ""the squishy healer is folds in combat due to low strength and defense"". In any rpg you will have those natural pros and cons to characters due to different stats  I don't mean simply classical rock-paper-scissor elemental systems or equivalents. Think Pokemon  Legend of Dragoon  Chrono Cross  Fire Emblem (types of physical damage  not elements).  I also don't necessarily mean abilities that are othereise good  but come at a cost.  I wish i could elaborate with some examples from other games but honestly i don't know any. Its usually elements  stats  or which things they are *not* good at.  I can give examples from a game i am designing (turn based rpg  party of 4 style)  though.  - One of the characters is a vampire  and healing magic and items do not work on him at all. He also loses vitality if he doesn't feed. - One of the characters is a Giant who cannot use/wear weapons and accessories with Magic in them  he loses power when attacked by magic. - One character is a werewolf and can't wear armor. - One of the characters is a faerie child  and her fear of the darkness that took her forest causes he to take extra damage from dark magic and become panicked when blind. - The main character loses spirit meter when their love interest is downed. (He is the only with spirit meter)  Some of these also make way for other different effects of the characters  or ways to be balanced  beneficial  etc. They are generally a result of lore and i use that lore to come up with mechanically interesting ways to make them different. I though i'd separate this and write it after bevause i'd be interested in hearing about any weaknesses of charas  not just ones styled like this. But  i thought a little blurb to explain why i'm interested could be useful. I'd love to hear any ideas or input!  - The vampire can heal himself as well as allies (if developed  he could pass as a designated healer. No charas is designed as a healer first and foremost but several charas have healing abilities). - The giant has high phys defense and can take attacks for nearby allies. - The werewolf is a shaman who uses spirit magick to equip spirits of monsters as armors. - The faerie overcomes this in their character arc and mechanically her abilities turn her into an 'Onion Knight' with some of the most powerful abilities. - The main chara gains spirit when his love interest is attacked but not downed. In his character arc as he matures  he gets over this and he doesn't frighten and overreact and it becomes another motivator. (These abilities come about on the skill tree after/as this relationship develops)  Let me what you think. I think some effects that relate to the individual character can be humanizing and compelling  as these flaws are personal to *them*. I think using the lore to find interesting mechanics can be done. I think using the lore to watch the mechanics they translate to develop from weaknesses i"
1121,I don't mind a character being taken away  as long as they don't:     1) Overdo it to the point it looses it's impact and makes me question if it's just plot convenience - Final Fantasy IV     2) They take away a member for a really weak story/gameplay reason - Again FFIV but also really bad in Dragon Quest VI and VII     3) Remove a party member at a point of the game where they would actually be useful - Earthbound     4) Remove a character without giving the player time to grow attached to them  which makes it just feel like the character shouldn't have been playable to begin with - Final Fantasy III and VII  Guess it would be simpler to just list when it's done well...
1122,I don't mind still playing D&D as I have a lot of friends who still really like to run it. But as for running a game  D&D just has this onerous amount of math games you have to play with yourself in designing encounters and dungeons. And if you get it wrong  the party dies. Or is bored. It's such a fiddly game when it boils down to it. I have moved on and prefer more narrative driven games like Blades in the Dark and PbtA games. I can prep for a more narrative driven game in like 15-30 minutes. Whereas D&D takes anywhere from an hour to four hours of not fun work.
1123,I don't personally want a FWD coupe (besides like a beater 80s/90s fwd sports coupe or kei car for giggles)  but the appeal over RWD/AWD for many people is still pretty clear to me. Generally speaking  at any given power level and wheelbase you get:   * Reduced drivetrain losses (more efficient and/or more power makes it to the road) * Lower weight * Lower cost * More interior space  If you don't care about understeer or are really dedicated at learning how to work around it / set up suspension to offset it somewhat  you can get a lot of bang for your buck performance wise.
1124,"I don't really know what your design goals are  so I'll just throw a few things out there.  - You could work in ""turns"" where a turn might be a day or a week. This would simplify traversal and would open up possibilities for further systems  like outpost building  scouting  etc  as well as time sensitive activities.  - You could write miniature situations in which a binary choice needs to be made. Example: Players come across a haul of valuable salvage but also hear a scream nearby. Do they help the presumable owner of this haul and risk not getting any of it or do they take it for themselves? Real simple stuff.   - Could make a wandering faction system that's easy to reuse. If they accidentally come across a hostile faction  they may enter into combat immediately. Friendlies might actively help. Neutrals are a coin flip. This gives since long term weight to their actions or inform them as to what territories they might want to plan around."
1125,I don't really know your level  or what you are trying to make but I've only been learning a few months and I've found this to be a great introductory project for Unity - [https://youtu.be/b8YUfee\_pzc](https://youtu.be/b8YUfee_pzc)   I think once I've done that I'll have the skills to make my own  I think that's how a lot of people started.
1126,I dont really see the issue.   Those are the directions those games chose to take. Assassins Creed especially has been integrating incremental/progression mechanics for a while. Some people enjoy that.   Its also only an RPG in the sense that its an action game with RPG elements (mostly just gear/stats). It doesnt limit the player in any meaningful way.
1127,I don't really understand this question - if it is something that feels right for your character  then it is something they would do.  There are no 'right' or 'wrong' moves in regards to roleplaying  just having fun and taking care you're not ruining the fun of others in the process.
1128,I don't recommend BG1 or Icewind dale  you won't miss anything if you don't play them. If you want to plunge into old crpg games just start with BG2 and consider Planescape: Torment.  For me its Torment >BG2.
1129,I dont regret trading in my GSR for my S2000  but I sure do miss that Integra. This new one has been such a roller coaster - excitement with the announcement  disappointment with the just a tarted Civic spy shots  now excitement again with the manual I doubt the engine will rev to 8000 but this new Integra is definitely on my radar to replace my aging 328i.
1130,"I don't see this as a problem myself. I do it a lot  its a great thing to get inspiration from everywhere. You cannot get it from a void afteral :P I sometimes even turn it into a sort of drinking game with friends to see if we recognize ""TTRPG"" tropes and behavior in other forms of media."
1131,I don't think its one of the most beautiful cars but I've always liked how the 6th Gen Accord Coupe V6 with OEM Spoiler looked like a mini-nsx of sorts. Too bad its automatic transmission is a shit show with self-destructing clutch-packs and its J30A3 motor is a pretty bullshit platform for modding. If they offered the CL-S motor and 6-speed transmission on it. it would have been better.
1132,I dont think that these are as distinctly tied for non-car enthusiasts  but I cant see a Ford Taurus without thinking about RoboCop. Either the second or sixth generation. Heck  I honestly felt a little bit like RoboCop in my early 2000s Taurus wagon!
1133,I don't think the problem is your age  I think it's moreso that you're not flexible about what you're willing to play. The fact that you want to play D&D1e in particular is *extremely* niche  so I'm not surprised at all that you're having trouble finding people.   Seriously  check out OSR-style games. You will like them and have an easier time finding people to play with.
1134,I don't think there is anyway to answer this question. There are so many variables that can effect it. Because there are two huge factors  How many copies were produced & How popular was/is the system  A system that does sell well and had a lot of copies made  well that is going to be easy to find. Or you can have a system that made very few physical copies but sells relatively well.  Plus as you just noticed  just because Amazon is out of stock doesn't mean there are no physical copies to find. A good place to look are web sites that do nothing BUT sell RPGs.  Drive Thru RPG SOMETIMES sells physical copies [https://www.drivethrurpg.com/index.php](https://www.drivethrurpg.com/index.php)  In the case of MORK BORG & Feretory I was able to find it on Free League: [https://freeleaguepublishing.com/en/store/?product\_id=5985103151253](https://freeleaguepublishing.com/en/store/?product_id=5985103151253)  So I don't think there is a good way to honestly answer your question.
1135,I don't think there's much you could do about stopping the hate or the harassment. You could create the greatest game in the world  one considered to be a work of art and set a new standard in games and people will still find a reason to hate it and harrass you about it for a large variety of reasons.
1136,I dont understand why people are such babies about something like this.  Worst case scenario theres a bad game that you dont have to play. Best case theres a good game that you get to play. What kind of a miserable human being wouldnt take those odds
1137,I don't understand why they can't fix this clown show. I've not had any modern standby issues on latitude so it's possible to at least get it to not hotbag  why xps team is so bad at this is inexplicable
1138,I drive the GT once or twice a week  I got a higher mileage example specifically because I knew I wanted to drive and work on it myself without hurting the value. Of course I could have invested the money I spent but you can't drive an index fund.
1139,I drove one. Scared the fuck out of me. Its a completely unique and brutal experience. Was thrown the keys to run some hotlaps in it and turned it down. Too much can go wrong and its the epitome of an unforgiving car. I'm just not skilled enough to get that car up to 7/10ths of its potential.
1140,"I either don't have the issue or I don't care. I invite people for playing whom I trust. If they still find it necessary to cheat at a game at which you can't even win  okay  their loss. As the GM  I have more efficient tools at my disposal than shitty player rolls anyway. I've played with people online who made their rolls using physical dice  unchecked by anyone else; I'm fine with that. I've also told players to make their characters on their own and had to reassure one player that  no  you don't have to wait for rolling your attributes until everybody in the group can see you rolling  I'll believe your sheet without seeing the dice.  It'll only become a problem if other players notice them cheating and have a problem with that. I'd probably then kick such a player or at the very least implement a new ""public roll"" feature; any and all rolls (also mine) are made in full view of everybody else  whether that's digital or in person. I'd suggest you do the same. It's the least confrontational and accusatory way to handle the suspicion  imo."
1141,I enjoy different types of games  so when I started to branch out  it was to get into things that were not fantasy.    However  power progression was the thing that drove me away from D&D.  I didn't like the idea that a level 1 character might fight 1 kobold and have a hard time  and a level 13 (ad&d) character could easily kill 100 kobolds before breakfast.  That power progression just irritated me.  In the game I replaced it with there is zero power progression in the game.  A day-one character is just as powerful as a long-running character.  The older character will be more skilled and might be a little more deadly  but the same enemy they had problems with on day one can kill them on day 100.
1142,I enjoyed it a bit. I got kinda bored with it though and realized the only reason I was still watching it week after week was because I had watched episodes and felt obligated to watch more not because I was particularly enjoying. When I just stopped watching it for like 3 weeks I had no desire to go back and catch up and finish. After last season I promised myself I just wouldn't watch as much stuff and would be pickier about shows I watched case trying to watch anything even slightly entertaining was just exhausting.
1143,I enjoyed it as a video game representation of the AP. It cuts plenty   but it stays interesting. I didn't have any bugs but it is the kind of rpg that you could screw yourself if you don't keep multiple saves(up to date). You can save in an unwinnable situation(that you shouldn't have been able to brute force your way into). The stock companions can be interesting   each with their own quests and upgrade paths.  You can also just buy custom companions if you want though(can get a bit expensive). I played an all Ranger party(after my normal game) so I Could get 6 animal companions as well(party of 12 by lvl 5-6ish).  It got silly but was a lot of fun.
1144,I enjoyed the first few episodes. Then I got bored around the middle.   But towards the end some plot starts to develop and the romance got a lot more sweet and cute and funny as you know more about them.  The CG never bothered me one bit
1145,I experience something similar with any good social interaction (not just dnd) so I feel you - from what I've researched it's basically endorphin high that your body overcompensates for that spins you in to a depressive episode or general emotional crash (since most bodies are used to relatively level emotional states  rather than peaks and valleys. Same concept as an adrenaline crash or coming off a sugar high  but more about emotions than energy).  To mitigate this stuff I'd recommend looking into ways people deal with sub-drop (I know it's odd seeing connections between intimate and regular social interactions  but the chemistry principles are the same).  That being said  I'm not a health professional  and talking to someone who is may be able to get you a better answer.
1146,I feel for you. But no  I don't have that issue. My game groups are all personal friends  and we've made major effort to stay gaming with each other  even during the pandemic. We range in age from 41 to 55 (I'm in the middle at 50) and have stayed with it.
1147,I feel like American Nightmare  Quantum Break and Control were all pointing toward Whatever happened to Alan Wake was real and we need to study it.  I feel like the result is that hes a god as long as he has a gun to his head and writes himself to be a god.
1148,I feel like Eugene looks like a mix of Lena and his bro Rei. Also damn that mf was a walking death flag Also  Im scared to see whats happening on Lenas side. 1st ep which is 9months ago from their timeline  they were talking about legions invading them hopefully she still safe n shi
1149,"I feel like pick up trucks are quickly becoming an upper middle class ""car"". It's wild that a V8 pick up truck borders on $70k. I guess you don't need a V8 and you can go with a V6 but overall I just feel like pick up trucks are becoming out of reach. Same with SUVs like the Tahoe  Suburban  etc. Maybe they've always had this relative value and I'm just now old enough to really understand the price.   The current market is insane. I'm not sure about general market on any of those cars as I don't have an interest in them  but if the inflation is due to the pandemic  there is hope. If it's because they're harder to find due to age/less availability...that just sucks."
1150,I feel like the Fire Emblem games on the 3DS (Awakening  Fates  Echoes) are pretty good introductions to the sub-genre. Not that they're the *best* of the bunch  but they are relatively simple and easy. This might be controversial  but I actually preferred Echoes to Fates and Awakening.  Final Fantasy Tactics (the original on the PS1) is a must-play. Not just for the tactical fighting  but the story is really solid. It has a mature  engaging plot  unlike Tactics Advance. But it is substantially harder  so I don't know if I'd recommend it as a first. Then again  it was probably the first tactical RPG game I played  at a rather young age  and I managed to beat it. It just took a long  long  long  long time  with lots of dying  reloading  and restarting.
1151,"I feel like the only ""cure"" for writing block is to keep writing  and being willing to throw ideas out when they aren't what you want.  But more importantly    work on not beating yourself up to get back to the place of creativity that you once enjoyed. That can be real hard to do  but there's nothing more devastating to creativity than repeating ""I *used* be able to do this"" to yourself over and over (I know because I catch myself doing it a lot). If you see this task as a chore  then it will be a chore and you'll shutdown.   Instead  try to focus on the parts you've written that you like and go easy on yourself. Maybe that can help you get have more fun while brainstorming. It's a long process but it helps some.  Good luck!"
1152,I feel like they would be better off with a numerical increase every generation  instead of a letter one. Most people people can recognize that an RTX 3070 is faster than an RTX 2070. In fact  most people would probably think an RTX 3060 is faster than an RTX 2080 even if it's usually not. Not so sure if the general public will know if a b700 vs will be faster than an a700.
1153,"I feel like this is a great topic! Personally  I'm fascinated by what I find fun  and why.  When I stumbled across Cookie Clicker years ago  I played it obsessively to completion. When I tried out Idleon  I blacked out for six weeks before I regained control of my life and beat the game (by uninstalling).  Are those great games? What makes me find them so compelling? I love them and I think they're incredibly well made. But for some reason I feel strange when I recommend them to others.  When I play the end game loot grind in Genshin Impact  would I rather be playing Cookie Clicker? When I am getting the most out of every daily and time-limited event in World of Warcraft  would I rather be playing Idleon?  I don't have any answers  it's just something I've been thinking about for years now.  Very timely topic too  since Tales of Arise is the latest AAA rpg to come out and it sells DLC that reduces the ""grind"" by some % for an additional bit of $. Just like the first ""rpg"" assassin's creed did."
1154,I feel like this is a little irresponsible past a certain point. These are consumer cables that can be interchangeable easily. 240W is a huge amount of power. I can't help but feel like this is going to lead to houses being burned down because poorly made cables end up being used in this manner.  The biggest safety benefit of isolated power cables for different purposes is that those cables end up only being used on the devices they're meant for and properly specced for.
1155,I feel like this is going to be one of those games that's much better a few years from now.  I really like the world  and there are bones there for an interesting game.  But you can really feel the late stage pivot in design philosophy; to the point where both PvE and PvP feel a bit undercooked.    I'm enjoying it as a fan of the MMO genre (always fun to be part of a new game launch)  but feel like I wont be able to recommend it in until a few years have past for them to iron out the kinks .  But if they can improve on what they have here and add more content  I could see it being a top 5 MMO one day.
1156,I feel like this is true for me  especially now when there are so many awesome games to choose from  and many more coming out. The vicious cycle for me is that I get really exited about a new game that I've found  trying to sell my players on it  start playing  lose enthusiasm few sessions in  find a new game  start over. Meanwhile  my players would just like to play characters they've made  see them develop and get stronger within an established framework  and not constantly have to make new ones.  So I wanted to ask if anyone else has similar experiences with themselves or their GMs  and maybe have some advice to deal with that.  Edit: To expand a bit more - obviously like u/vernes1978 pointed out  this is a good way to kill player investment. So my more specific question would be if you have any advice on keeping your current game fresh and exiting for yourself as well as your players long term.
1157,I feel like this show is gonna be a battle to fight one bad guy and all the adults shown in the OP and ED are training the lost races (humans  dwarfs  fairies etc) to do that then once there role is done they die  maybe way Gus tried to get Will to kill him. Regarding Blood and Gus wanting Will to lose  I think he doesnt want Blood to lose his pride as a warrior if Will wins. This show is really growing on me and its only episode 2. Cant wait to see whats next as Will becomes a bad ass
1158,I feel like user-to-user is a pretty unique scenario. I mean  how many of us are running userspace network stacks?   I'm also curious if there's gonna be a fallback or if you need to code two codepaths depending on available support.   Kernel-to-user may be pretty great with IO and shit.
1159,"I feel like you could have handled the initial discord situation better. If there were people willing to run a fan server there's gonna be people willing to moderate the official one on your behalf with you merely filling an oversight role. That being said  what is done is done  I would say to move on \*without forgetting your existing fanbase\*. You're always going to get dipshits if you get popular digitally it's just a fact of life but theyre always a vocal minority. Your game has a community behind it which  while having toxic elements clearly overall is passionate about your work. Entirely moving on from them would A: technically validate the toxic pricks claims of you abandoning them and B: be a wasted marketing opportunity.  Also try publicly insulting the people being mean to you. It shows they arent ""winning"" and can incense the people who arent dicks in your community to fight back on your behalf."
1160,I feel like you described life.  You do repetitive task (work) for reward (money).  You are more likely to do said task the better you are rewarded for it.    Considering the games you mentioned are rpgs with humans  you are going to do human things (work).  You have to do a bunch of work (side quests/mob grind/explore) until you have earned enough to make it to the next big item in the game (story progression) or in life (buy a car/have kids) Its familiar.
1161,I feel personally like web is easier because people have made it easier. Its much more widespread so the tools and frameworks are much more live spread. Plus  it's where all the money is  so lots of smart people can invest their time into it to make every step of the way as painless as possible.  I feel with gaming  the only real way to approach it is with an all encompassing  generalized  scatter gun approach. No game engine these days is specialized to create a single type of game  and thus all are very modular and component base  which is great for expandability  but not very accessible. and then there is the sheer scale of game development  and all the fascets it can take.   A website is a website is a website. Games however vary so wildly and have so many unrelated disciplines that need to coerce together to make work that it's truly impossible to tool for. And any tools out there are behind a pay wall that amateurs and hobbyists aren't willing to commit to.  The sheer amount of work to make anything compelling is like building a whole framework from scratch on web. Its a lot of work with very little to show for it  even if it is a bigger piece of the puzzle than most people realize  games are all about visual results.
1162,"I feel really sad for Shin and others  as they are still ""eighty sixers"" even though they passed through hell to get here. Shin also lost his first friend in Federacy and the embodiment of Rei/Lena in the most tragic way."
1163,I feel that its kinda wierd  but I loved it.  I ran a Dark Heresy game where the PCs were on a world  which several large abandoned cities that had a heavy bloodborne vibe.  during a exploration of a cathedral  they found a black smooth pyramid  some sort of artifact.  At the time  I had no real plans for it  but they were really interested in it and engaged a lot with the game because they now had this mysterious thing that seems to defy explanation.  It motivated the group in a way that made everything else also seem more interesting.  However  Im not sure I could replicate that experience  as I think there might have been a lot of factors that played a role in making this possible.
1164,I feel this  especially with online games and mostly when my depression was worse. At some points I grabbed a cat and cried in his fur after most sessions. Don't underestimate the amount of people that have slumbering to crippling depression in these disconnected times.   Within an RPG  life is exiting  we are among friends and we're doing things. Real life can now feel empty and devoid of stimulants in comparison.  I don't normally encourage people to go to a screen late at night  but it can help to play a short  calming game  some 30 minutes or so to wind yourself down and get you ready for sleep.  I do think you need more help  between the lines I read you are not enjoying life outside of games at the moment  and that's no way to go forward. I heartily recommend therapy and couldn't have gotten away from where I was without it.
1165,I feel this somewhat. I don't tend to force this compulsion on my players. I satiate my addiction by purchasing rulebooks and reading them cover to cover. I have read about a dozen more systems than I actually played and just as many 5e adventure modules. Sometimes they serve as inspiration for a bit of homebrewery in my current games  but mostly I just like to explore it with my own imagination.  In order to make sure I don't feel burnout on the adventure I'm running with my groups  I leverage modules to cut down on prep time. That way I can focus on the fun of the session and just enjoy the time spent with my players. Modules also help to ensure there's a sense of progression without me having to do a ton of work to stitch everything together.
1166,I feel 'ya. Most of web dev is barely programming  it's mainly just boring work glueing frameworks together to get something to work. Very little actual problem solving/engineering going on there.    Games on the other hand are one of the harder programming fields  things need to be responsive  feel good   I imagine transferring to actual programming could be very frustrating at first  but if you keep at it  it's very rewarding and interesting. I think it is actually quite addictive  like a good puzzle game. Once I set out on solving a problem I become obsessed with trying to work out a solution to it.
1167,I feel you.  There is a middle ground. You can use some narrative techniques while striving to keep that delicious first person immersion. For example  allowing the cleric PC to describe their religion to the other PCs diegetically  and in so doing actually create a religion for the world. Or having a PC tell the others about their homeland  people  language  etc.
1168,I felt that also when playing Pillars of Eternity. Idk why but I had no immersion at all  no bond to the characters  no will to know the lore.   Then I moved to other genres. I still have no patience to play pure RPGs. I believe they are basically the same. But tbh I dont know how to explain this feeling.   Im more into survival games now. And Fall Guys. Damn  how much I laugh with that silly game.
1169,I felt the same way as the OP about the 2nd generation Scion tC. Granted  I liked how it looked from the start  but it would fit right in with Toyotas current lineup.  Surprisingly  the current Kia Forte feels like it will age well. Something about it reminds me of an early 90s Mitsubishi Galant - in a good way.  The current Sonata will likely be appreciated more when the next one arrives  since they announced they will be going in a more conservative direction.  On the other hand  I feel much differently about a lot of other Hyundai/Kia products. I feel like the new Tucson will age like milk. It already looks like a bad mashup of a Mach-E and a Saab 9-4X. The Elantra reminds me of a guppy  and is somehow forgettable at the same time.
1170,I find Cypher System to be a breeze to run  and it's easy for players to understand  too. Check out these free quickstart adventures for Numenera:  https://www.montecookgames.com/store/product/the-spire-of-the-hunting-sound-quickstart-adventure/  https://www.montecookgames.com/store/product/ashes-of-the-sea-pdf/
1171,I find it much more annoying when a character gets forced into my party and I have to remove an optional character that I actually like  and have taken time to build his or her skills and carefully fit them with the best equipment available up to that point. Especially annoying when I don't even get a chance to access the new person's inventory and I have to take on a boss with someone who is underpowered and has just got their wimpy default gear on.
1172,I find shelves like these: https://www.amazon.com/IRIS-USA-Inc-Hardware-Cabinet/dp/B07DFDS56H/ref=sr_1_2?dchild=1&keywords=tool+drawers&qid=1634492165&sr=8-2 are an affordable option for organizing minis and terrain.  You can get versions that just have the smaller shelves (better for regular minis) or just the big ones (good for bigger minis and terrain)  and if you get a label maker you can have every mini/terrain piece in your collection in nice  labeled  alphabetically-organized (easy to find/put stuff away) drawers.  The only downside is that you need a different solution for the really big terrain/minis.
1173,I find that if theres not a pre-made system for it  I try to use a generic system  or a system thats been used in many genres so that Im familiar enough with it to bend the rules to whatever genre I want.  I think you should look into the tinyD6 system. The core mechanic is REALLY light.  The quick and dirty explanation is that characters dont have stats  only traits. To roll a check  you roll 2d6 and if either die comes up 5+  you succeed. If a trait or circumstance gives you disadvantage  thats 1d6. If a trait or circumstance gives you advantage  thats 3d6. All attacks deal 1 HP.  Really quick and easy to handle. You can make any enemy by just deciding how many hits it should take to kill them  and then giving them 1-2 traits.  You could also check out the WyRM system. 3 stat game where theres a lot of freedom to make your own skills and talents. Only need 1d6 to play. If you want to play as kids maybe they have a stat total or 5 instead of 10.
1174,I find web dev way harder  because of all the individual little things that must be learned. Unlike with most programming  learning one web dev tool/system/paradigm does nothing to help you with other systems. Worse  it's impossible to understand anything from the bottom up  because everything is a duct tape hack on top of a mountain of duct tape hacks.  Web dev feels like invoking magic spells  where game dev feels like writing laws. In one  problems are solved by knowing the right magic words. In the other  problems are solved by understanding them inside and out
1175,I finished X episodes of Y today. How many do you watch per day?   It's a misconception among amateur anime watchers that watching more = being better. I've seen people pick up Naruto. Watch 22 episodes for 6 day  then call it too long and drop it.  Let a man enjoy 1 episode of Non Non Biyori per 3 days for fuck's sake.
1176,I found a game that made me enjoy the hobby after many years of burnout on D&D. Havnt played D&D in years now.  But I also realized D&D teaches some rather bad/toxic behaviours: * The GM is expected to do all the work  leading to burn out/stress. * Teaches a player vs gm mentality. * Longer combat = is not fun * Rules for everything  And that is just some of the things that made me move away from D&D.
1177,I found it interesting just how much faster the 2700X was than the 1800.   It's typically 10% faster in these benchmarks  despite being only clocked 2.5% higher.   In this scenario (with fixed all-core overclocks) Zen and Zen+ are almost identical  it's the same floor plan  just on a different process. The only difference is the desktop release of Zen had a silicon bug resulting in the L2 cache latency increasing from 12 cycles to 17 cycles.  This silicon bug was fixed in the next stepping of Zeppelin and all following zen 1 products (EPIC  Threadripper  Ryzen Pro). It's only the Desktop release of Zen 1 effected.   Shows what impact a 40% penalty in L2 access latency has on gaming benchmarks.  ---------------  I also love the shade thrown towards the FX series by giving it every advantage  using the slightly better Piledriver architecture and keeping all eight cpu modules enabled  then only comparing it to zen chips with only four cores enabled.  While I agree that it's unfair to call the FX-8350 an eight-core chip  I think it's also unfair to call it a quad-core. The reality is murky and somewhere in the middle.  I think the fairest comparison would be disabling half the modules (one per cluster) and then comparing it to zen chips with four cores and hyper-threading disabled. Then again  that would just make Bulldozer/Piledriver lose even harder.
1178,I found my first few track days stressful. I had visions of being fast so was beating myself up. Then I just relaxed  enjoyed it  and the speed started increasing. Still so many faster drivers but I see now how little that matters.   Also  take care of your car as said by others.  Great question tho.
1179,I found out about this system a while ago when I was searching for Final Fantasy styled TTRPGs and I have been SO hyped for the full English release! I'll be grabbing a copy of this scenario asap and learning as much as I can to prepare for the real thing.
1180,I generally don't listen to OPs and EDs so i can barely remember any of them. But the song [fluorite eye's song](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2qcvp5nE4Lc) from the last episode of vivy was something else.
1181,I genuinely don't get it. I'm a bit of a gamer  a bit of an artist- I use my laptop for all sorts of things  and let's compare this framework laptop to another laptop you might get.  You're paying a pretty premium price for it- seems like it costs 30% more than any other hp/dell/asus/whatever laptop with the same CPU and RAM specs  and on top of that  you don't even get a dGPU!  So  you're sacrificing a dGPU and paying 30% more  but what are you getting in return?  You can simply unscrew a few screws and access the internals of the laptop!!! ...same with most other laptops unless you're getting a mac or something.  You can upgrade the RAM  WWAN card  and storage! ...same with any other laptop where the bottom comes off.  You can't upgrade the CPU or GPU on those other laptops tho  since they're soldered onto the motherboard! Well  same with Framework  actually... just like with a desktop  you rarely will upgrade your CPU without having to get a better motherboard to support it anyway  and Framework doesn't even offer you a GPU.  It would be very neat if they offer different displays! But  they don't. It would be neat if they offered different webcams! but  they don't. It would be neat if you can upgrade the timings and clocks of your RAM! But  you can't. You can get more or less  sure  but other laptop manufacturers also let you modify that.  So  what can you modify in framework that you simply can't in basically any other laptop? Well... the output ports. That's basically it as far as I know. You're paying way more  losing a dGPU... when you could just buy a decent laptop and a $20 dongle on amazon  and in several years  instead of trying to maybe wedge in another stick of RAM or maybe getting the latest CPU + mobo for $1000... just buy a new laptop.
1182,"I get exactly where you are coming from. As much as I like the *idea* of collaborative worldbuilding  I also like to be surprised. I like to figure out what's coming on my own  and get that sense of glee when I was right. You don't get that when you help build the world and everything in it.  And  the slog of combat in D&D and its ilk is slow  and characters are both too complicated  and too ""same"". I've written enormous spreadsheets or programs to help roll up balanced encounters  replete with saves  hp  etc.  just so I don't spend hours prepping.  For me  the solution was Savage Worlds - characters don't feel ""samey""  combat is faster  and I can create an NPC enemy on the fly while I'm describing him to the players. ""He's a tall  hatchet faced man  his dark hair carefully combed back. He's holding his spear with the confidence of a trained soldier."" *Agility d8  Strength d8  other attributes d6  fighting d10  ehhh... Taunt d6. Parry 6  toughness... Chain armor  so 8(3). Done.*  The reality is  I don't use ""vanilla"" Savage Worlds. I've house ruled a handful of things  but overall  I've built it to use the narrative I want  and the mechanics I want. Is it perfect? No. Is it what I want to play? *Definitely!* Because I beat it into shape  and it does everything that I want it to."
1183,I get that the primary purpose is for pixel binning while zoomed in  but i cant help but wonder if just making a true 2.56um pixel pitch sensor wouldnt be better for low light and iso sensitivity. It wouldnt do 8k video i guess but is 8k video really providing a lot value to people? The rear lens likely cant resolve 33mp it probably barely resolves 12mp.  Either way its cool to see how large smartphone sensors have gotten. I wonder if well see a micro 4/3 sensor on a phone in the distant future.
1184,I get this at my local gaming store as well. A kid said that 5e was the easiest to learn and I just laughed. I don't know when the notion that 5e was ever thy easiest game to play  but it's ridiculous.
1185,"I get what you're saying  but if anything is that *addictive* to you personally  you should abstain.  I'll also add that out of all the Fallout games  4 is the worst imo.  It's not the XP that's *satisfying* to me  it's the character development.  Which requires a strong narrative and choices made along th way to have an impact.  Fallout 4 is basically a fetch quest with shallow storyline and pales in comparison to other titles in the franchise.  What game are you talking about that has ""unneccessary rpg elements?""  This whole argument seems kinds flimsy  personally."
1186,I get what youre saying.  Its because consumers dont have good taste and manufacturers make what consumers want.  The idiocy of a coupe goes even further than you mentioned.  Removing the B pillar from a car makes the chassis MUCH less rigid.  It also hinders side impact safety.  These types of coupes are stupid.  I dont think they even look better.
1187,I GM as a favor to our forever GM. Hes been running kickass campaigns for us for years  so the least I can do is run a one-shot every now and then. Plus it gives our group a chance to try new systems or make wacky characters.   Still makes me anxious af every time.
1188,"I got 3 that I usually always look for in any rpg or jrpgs or arpgs..  Monks: just punching people to death with deadly precision while wearing some cloth on ur body  feels badass af.  Rogues: there is something lovely about watching backstabs with dual wielding knives...bid your time..play careful and you can blow someone up with a single attack...a wrong move or a bad position  you're squishy enough to die in a single hit too.  Any class which rely on thier own health pools or damage themselves while attacking  your blood mages  berserkers and the like. These classes are sooo much fun  coz it's the ultimate risk vs reward...and it feels ""dangerous""..hehe."
1189,I got a 1973 Triumph GT6 not long after I graduated from college in 1987.  It was a quirky car  but nothing special at the time.  Daily drove it for years.  It took me across the country when I moved out west in 1993.  It's still sitting in my garage.  Waiting patiently for me to either restore it  or sell it to someone who will.  What I'm saying is...it's for sale.
1190,I got a 2020 Mustang GT and just read that the 2022 Mustang GT will have 10 less hp/ torque due to emissions standards. Im thinking I may have the most powerful gas GT ever and all future ones will be hybrid/electric. And yeah theyll be faster  but Im hoping some one will pay good money for a car from the good ol days lol
1191,I got a catalytic converter code on my 2006 Honda Pilot and the guy at the parts store suggested cataclean. Is it safe to use on my vehicle or can it cause more problems down the road? Thanks in advance!
1192,I got a decently clean  low mileage NA Miata for $2 000 right before the market went insane. Knew it was a special car but never thought it would triple in value in a couple years. I planned on never selling it but seeing what similar ones are going for now tempts me sometimes.
1193,I got a super clean bmw z3 roadster not too long ago and in the last year I've seen it go up 2 to 3k in value. In 2 years it'll be eligible for classic car plates in my state and I'm excited to see how much it'll be worth then!
1194,I got an old laptop from like 2008-2009. It's HP Compaq Presario V3000. It has got the following specs (I guess the CPU could be the one higher than the one I mentioned): Intel Core 2 Duo T7100 (could be T7300) 2GB DDR3 RAM GMA graphics 120GB HDD (still works lol) This laptop is dead but I want to use it as it's kinda sad to see it dead because it's my first COMPUTER. If this laptop gets revived  I will add another 2GB stick to make it more usable or even install Windows 10. Please help 
1195,I got my first car at 16. I bought it with the understanding that my parents would help with the cost of replacing the transmission. It was a Plymouth Sundance Duster (4 door). It was a little sedan with a V6. Underpowered by todays standards  but a ton of fun for a teenager.   So much fun  in fact  that I overheated the car and cracked the head. I drove the car to school (6-ish miles) every day and to my girlfriends (30 miles) every weekend. All with water just pumping into the cylinder.  In this state  the car could only drive about 3 miles before getting too hot. So I would stop every few miles and get water to fill it up. I had a bunch of gallon jugs and knew every place in the county that had a water hose.   It was wild. I spent hours to get to my girlfriends house every weekend. The extra time and effort to get a place just felt like nothing compared to the ability to freely see who I wanted and do what I want.   I drove it like that for around 8 months before being able to get something else. After that  anything in moderate running order was a luxury car. The ability to travel 60 miles in an hour was an effortless trip that seemed like it was just down the road a little.   I think this is why I love all cars. I have a Stinger GT and the car is amazing  but I also had a 2017 Base model Spark with crank windows and I liked that too. I just love vehicles. Between the freedom they bring and the engineering that went into them  I just cant get enough of them.
1196,"I got my license during the height of the early fast and furious craze. If I could go back in time I'd say to myself ""Stop wasting time street racing with amateurs that cant drive for shit. Go to your local track day and autocross and race people that actually know how to drive and set up a car properly to be fast  not just make noise.""  If I had went legit from the beginning I can only imagine how much better my lap times would be  today. But oh well  better late than never."
1197,I got this old pentium 4 desktop PC  its got a 2.4ghz model. Im looking for graphics cards for it to turn it into a retro gaming machine  and the motherboard supports only AGP 4X 1.5v cards. Thanks in advance.
1198,I guess for the versatility they brought. A lot of people are scared of spiders  some variants can spit poison  they can weave sticky webs and lay multiple eggs.   If you could choose another animal or insect for a game  what would you choose?
1199,I guess Gallus figured out that Rudeus has Foresight Eye from how he saved him from getting hit by the pot back in Episode 1  and adapted his fighting style this episode  which is how he managed to hit Rudeus with the flying dagger.
1200,I guess I expect gta v versions of those games graphically... we'll see. it's not worth it for me to get a remaster that functionally looks the same. I can just play it on my phone or something and be ok
1201,I guess if you work with simple flat colored shapes you can generate them in such a way that it looks like a single shape. Though it's hard to get it right I assume. Is there a reason why you want to generate it instead of having some pre-drawn images?
1202,I guess it's up to you as whether it bothers you  IF that's happening. For me  I wouldn't want someone like that at my table.   Even if it's just a sad cry for help  which seems dramatic  it's the sign of someone you can't trust and takes away from the energy of the game...even if you're the only one who knows  or even suspects. If the energy isn't right around the table  I wouldn't invite people back that aren't a good fit.  My 2 duckets.
1203,"I guess part of the question is which ""voice"" are you looking to improve? Are you referring to a ""narrative voice"" or the physical one?  As another poster noted  if you're talking about your physical voice there are some good videos on improving your speaking voice etc. If you're talking about a narrative voice (like how you describe a scene)  I think anything that improves writing skills will help there."
1204,I guess path of radiance by default I guess since all my real picks got omitted lol.   SS could kinda use one though and add another difficulty on. Awakening too to fix the gameplay to be more like how fates fixed it  though idk how they'd fix the story in either of those games. Radiant Dawn before PoR would be weird.
1205,"I guess similarly to following The Cherno  Handmade Hero or other dev logs I'd probably mostly tune in (= watch the vlogs on demand) if I spot interesting topics.  So apart from what others stated about the content and quality  it would be nice if a blog or YT title + description wrap up quickly/concisely if there's anything specific in the video I'd like to see.  This is a bit beyond general dev logs - needs a lot of planning or even rehearsal (?) - still personally what I find extremely interesting to learn and watch is when The Cherno  Freya Holmr  Molly Rocket / Handmade Hero (by Casey Muratori)  or Jason Weimann often break things down first ""on paper"" before they show any code. E.g. introducing some theory/math  explaining their train of thought  or visualizing a problem/algorithm  etc."
1206,I had a 2008 SRT4 and everyone except the dealer thought it was a press in bearing. It was a hub and bearing assembly. I had parts guys at three parts stores tell me I was wrong. Well  when I changed the other one  the dealer sold me a bolt in hub  so either your system is wrong on a car that sold 6 000 units  or I was working on some other car.
1207,I had a celica alltrac back in the day I bought for $3k as a kid. I have an M2 competition now  but I also bought both with the knowledge that they were special cars. The m2 is my daily so itll never be worth a ton or anything but I like having something unique and special.
1208,"I had a clone of this truck: https://bringatrailer.com/listing/1984-toyota-4x4-pickup-9/  Same exact paint  but lifted and aftermarket wheels and bumpers.  It had 31"" tires but still had factory gearing so it could barely crawl up hwy 80 to get to Tahoe.  I think I got $3500 for it when I sold it in 1997  which was about right at the time.    I got a 633CSi after that  which I ended up donating after it failed smog a few years later.  I guess that make this post a twofer."
1209,I had a couple of tabs on my browser open as well as discord and my computer just restarted  there appears to be no harm done. A few things came to my mind  overheated  using a lot of RAM etc. What do you guys think it is and should I be worried?
1210,I had a Honda Accord V6 6 speed Coupe for 10 years. Its pretty much pure aesthetics  there are no functional reasons to get a coupe.   I would have loved to get a sedan version instead but they are ultra rare.
1211,I had a L67 powered Holden Commodore many years back where the L67 was only offered in 1 particular model for that series.  I had to mix and match manuals from the series I owned that didnt document the L67 and the later series where the L67 was available in all models to be able to work on it and order the correct parts.  Was an interesting car but it turned me off working on cars in general.
1212,I had a list of crap written here of what you could do to troubleshoot  but I think you just need new tires. You can't reverse mount the PS all seasons because they have a defined inside/outside. You can probably find someone to do it... but don't. Just get new tires. A decent set of affordable all-seasons will perform better than a jacked up and backward set of PS AS4s.  [Check out these Vredestein's from Tire Rack](https://www.tirerack.com/tires/tires.jsp?tireMake=Vredestein&tireModel=Hypertrac+All+Season&frontTire=24YR8HTASXL&rearTire=535YR8HTASXL&vehicleSearch=true&fromCompare1=yes&autoMake=Lexus&autoYear=2017&autoModel=IS%20300&autoModClar=)
1213,I had a lot of fun. My point of references are brieft stints with WoW and Ffxvi. I liked the action combat a lot. Seems like you can get creative with builds. Love the open world pvp. Crafting is cool.  Biggest criticisms people have are no mounts or minimap but i feel like it defeats the purpose of the game. Its not meant to be played as a fetch quest-a-thon. Youre supposed to gather mats along the way  travel in packs  do quests to build up the territory.
1214,I had a P0420 code (catalytic converter operating below threshold) on my old Thunderbird pop up a few times so I decided to give a bottle of Cataclean a try. Followed the instructions and the code went away for good. It has been almost 4 years since.  The only issue I've had since was the Evap Purge Valve Solenoid went bad  but it was a 25 year old part.  It is probably unrelated to the Cataclean I put in the car 4 years ago.  You should only need to use one or two bottles at most. Anymore than that and your cat is more messed up than something a few chemicals can fix.
1215,"I had a pretty similar issue  while I didn't really mind getting a kingdom (yeah  your party certainly isn't qualified to run a whole state  but that was part of the point. The aldoris want to use your realm as military reinforcements in case a civil war breaks out  so it makes a bit of sense for them to give you lordship as soon as you prove competent in warfare)  I certainly didn't feel the power that comes with it.   By the endgame you've got an army  a working economy and multiple militias  and yet  as the goddamned king  you still need to walk to the other edge of the realm in order to deal with some goblins with your own hands (even worse when you put your companions in positions of power  of course I am gonna take my treasurer dragon hunting  why wouldn't I?).   The kingdom management feels disjointed from normal gameplay  as soon as you leave the throne room  everyone stops treating you like royalty. Your army is intangible  only phisically appearing on the endgame (in the form of 4 dudes with spears) and they still feel useless. Characters will rarely treat you as if you were powerful  giving you the standard RPG hero treament  and I can count with my fingers the amount of times a kingdom choice actually affected the overworld.  Thankfully  WoR adresses quite a few of these problems  but it stills suffers from ""character too important to do this shit  ends up doing all of that shit"" syndrome."
1216,I had a similar experince with it. The gameplay is pretty good but the way it forces you to either grind like your life depends on it or buy EA-esque microtransaction kinda ruins it for me. Also the writing is hit or miss at best. Overall i got a 4/10 experience.
1217,"I had a similar issue  but mostly that id be running a game  say  a heist  and then a new scifi movie would come out and id go ""oh wait  no  what? This needs to be the gmae now!""  And so id lose interest in the game i was running  have split focus between the game i was running and the new game i was writing and would often abandon both when a third  fourth  fifth or sixth option came up.  I was a GM for fourteen years before a group of mine went levels 1-20 once. Not that we didnt have a blast the whole way.  Pacing yourself is difficult.  Now i write most of an adventure before i run it because i recognize how much work i put into a 7 or 8 level game.  I still occasionally write down brainstorms but ive learned better."
1218,I had a talk with my group  and they told me they like to play in a system for at least 6 months to feel it was worth the effort/investment  so I commit to staying with a game for at least that long (which isn't that long at all  really).  One thing I noticed  for me at least  is the more I'm able to talk about a game with someone  the more interested I stay. So I try to find someone to collaborate with  either in the group or someone else (my SO does sometimes  which is nice).
1219,I had an idea for a 2d game that I'd like to make into a reality but I personally have no interest in developing games myself. So far the only place I can seem to find developers to do these types of projects is on fiver. Are there any other places to find freelance game devs/game studios.
1220,"I had just bought Call of Cthulhu (5th Ed I think) back in '94 and none of our usual suspects wanted to run it. I had only been roleplaying for just over a year and was the kind of person who mostly sat in the background.  I was petrified at the thought of GMing CoC  especially as most of the players were older than me  and they included a Lovecraft buff.  They encouraged me to give it a go  and I ran one of the adventures from the main rulebook. Things got off to a shaky start  the SAN rules upset some people who had only played DnD  but I was able to explain why they were needed  and how they fit the themes of the game.     People got into the game and later in the evening one of the previous complainers said ""I don't know about my character  but I'm f\*\*king scared."""
1221,I had new Michelin Pilot Sport S4 all season tires mounted about 16k miles ago. About 6k miles later I noticed an odd wubble noise  no shake in the steering wheel or anything  but definitely an uneven tire wear kind of noise. I unfortunately overlooked having an alignment done when I had the tires mounted. I took the car into the dealership and had them check the alignment  which was off. They said there was some feathering on the inside edge of the rear tires and said a rotation and rebalance was needed  in addition to the alignment. The noise is still there (which is expected) about 12k miles later  However It seems to maybe even be getting more apparent.  The car runs a staggered setup (OEM) so I can only switch tires left to right and vice-Versa. Researching the issue  I cant find much of anything as far as fixing the issue with tires. I have found that the IS  even at stock alignment  does have some negative camber on the rear tires. This commonly causes more wear on the inside edge than outer edge. My question is: would it help the noise to have the tires unmounted and placed on the opposing sides wheel? For example  unmount the left rear and mount on the right rear. That way the feathered edge is on the outside rather than inside? Im thinking that putting the feathering on the outside which has slightly less ground contact may help with the noise? Any other options short of new tires? Any input is appreciated. Thanks
1222,I had success with Tails of Equestria  based on My Little Pony  with a six year old girl.   The rules are simple and yet there's some customisations.   The setting is cute but with room for adventures (the writers definitely read the Monster Manual before writing the show).     But honestly  as long as the rules are simple (so no D&D or Pathfinder)  the real challenge is for the GM  not for the game.  Also  keep in mind that your 7-y-o is unlikely to stay focused for a long time. Sessions of 1h  1h30 is probably best.
1223,I had the same problem when i was in indie gamedev team. But i spended all day for a development because i was only one programmist in a team.at this time  yoga and static exercises before bed helped me a lot. Also recently i opened for myself a mini zen garden. Is so relaxing and satisfying. I hope my advices can help you
1224,I had the same problem with my P12s/P14s  got 5 P12s (value pack ftw) and 3 P14s  I'd say 6 out of 7 fans had that annoying hum. Performance was just fine  and from a pure decibel standpoint they were perfectly adequate  but something no review tells you and can measure is that terrible hum that might drive you nuts if you're sensitive to it.  I have none of these fans in my PC anymore for that reason.
1225,I had this idea and it kinda went sideways but still works.   So I wanted a pool of people to play games with and initially was using my discord to run games by different DMs across different systems. This broke up due to other DMs wanting full control of the discord so we opted to just split the games into their own discords organized by each DM. I don't love this as now I'm in like 4 different discord servers with largely the same people save for 1 or 2.  Where this works is that we share some players. My games have lasted and will last for probably 1yr+ in 5E dnd while the other servers/ other DMs run smaller focused games. So in those games we experiment in different systems and styles. Which everyone knows going in.  The only one minus to making the jump to different systems/styles is creating a bunch of characters. After doing this for now 3 years...I'm running out of ideas a little bit. So I'd recommend jumping to a new system maybe twice a year at most.   A great benefit to doing this is that your players really expand their RP abilities and retain a great vibe while playing with people they trust.
1226,I had to give up my dream car several years ago.  I saved up for a few years  and right after I got a new job  I bought a '86 Toyota MR2.  It didn't take long at the new job to figure out that business was NOT booming  and I never made enough to maintain the car the way it needed and deserved.  It absolutely broke my heart to see it decline in disrepair.  I opted to sell it  rather than let it rot in my driveway.  It was the right decision  financially and for the car  but I miss it every day.  The good news is  hard times don't last forever.  I ended up going back to school  and recently got a steady job that pays MUCH better than what I was doing before.  I haven't had a car at all in about two years  and I can't wait to get another one.  You'll be back on your feet soon enough!  Keep your head up and use that future car as motivation.  It worked for me!
1227,I had to sell my car last september when I sort of lost my job due to the pandemic. I got a new job and such and eventually wanted to buy it back... but it had become way too expensive. So I got a cheaper car instead.  Some day I'll get that car back. It was so fun.
1228,"I hate being asked ""should I watch this show? I already love the premise  artstyle  ost  etc but still not sure""  Like just watch a fucking episode or two. You are already interested.   Also on the same level but ""should I watch X anime? I've already seen clips and would love this but its around 100 episodes so I'm holding off"""
1229,I hate game to screen translations  theyre usually terrible.  But theoretically if you somehow put a great team behind it  then obviously Final Fantasy 5 or 6: The Show could be cool.  I want the best writers and directors and cast though.
1230,"I hate gamedev because  * to earn money you must treat it as a real job with long hours (fortunately i figured this out early) * everything has been done already * difficulty curve is exponential for larger projects * most game ideas are silly (this one hits me hard) * doing art is hard  easier to buy assets * 99% of projects end up abandoned * hate the ""jack of all trades"" aspect to gamedev  I love gamedev because:  * it calms me down * its a great creative outlet * nice feeling when you finish something * awesome feeling showing friends finished stuff * i love to polish existing projects * love to think about creative approaches to different problems * love the ""jack of all trades"" aspect to gamedev  I don't hate gamedev enough to quit it. But i don't love it enough to continue it T\_\_T  Wishing i would budge to either loving it or hating it. The middle ground sucks"
1231,I have 2010 750li (n63 engine and f02 body). It was burning oil so BMW was sued and local dealer performed work to replace the valve stem seal for free. Right after I drove out of dealer  my check engine light came on. Took it back to the dealer. They are lying (to my opinion and logic) about the condition is pre existing. Good thing is they gave me the very detailed invoice  and the work invoice state there is no issue. They also told me that my engine problem does not have anything to do with the work they performed. I talked to service advisor  general manager  but they just blew me off. I called BMW USA  they told me I need to talk to local dealer. Is there anything I can do about this? (the fact they are lying about things?  and my check engine light came on right after?) Valve stem replacement and full coolant line replace is not small task?  I dont know if they dropped engine and touched intake manifold at all  or throttle body. I did a smoke test  and found the connection between throttle body and intake is leaking. My car is running fine at high RPM  but at stop light  it runs rough at low idle.  Fuel trim  intake manifold pressure (after throttle) and smoke test all indicates a vacuum leak after throttle.  Can this happen due to aging? ( I understand some parts can break due to aging  but this one??)  I have video attached:  Smoke coming out between intake manifold and throttle body.  [https://youtube.com/shorts/\_Ws5M-LD1C8?feature=share](https://youtube.com/shorts/_Ws5M-LD1C8?feature=share)  &#x200B;  Is it normal (aging  wear and tear) to have leak where throttle body and intake manifold joints?  Throttle body is metal with oring.  Intake manifold seems to be plastic.  UPDATE:  I got the throttle body off  here is what I saw  the gasket failed pretty crazy way:  [https://imgur.com/a/TL4kFPV](https://imgur.com/a/TL4kFPV) Is this just normal wear and tear? High temperature vibration in engine bay? I wonder how long this has been there and why I never got any complain about it
1232,"I have a (weird) suggestion: channel that urge into a productive effort.  I have a small site called [Goblin Crafted](https://www.goblincrafted.com) which recommends RPGs to people based on a genre or franchise.  We have [Avatar: the Last Airbender RPGs](https://www.goblincrafted.com/recommendations/franchise/Avatar%3A_The_Last_Airbender/)  [Indiana Jones RPGs](https://www.goblincrafted.com/recommendations/franchise/Indiana_Jones/)  [Giant Monster RPGs](https://www.goblincrafted.com/recommendations/genre/Giant_Monster/) (think Godzilla  Pacific RIm  etc.) and so on.  If you're passionate about the intersection of (TTRPG) gaming and media  and you have decent writing skills  you could potentially be a great contributor on the game recommendations front.  But even if you're not familiar with enough RPGs to recommend them  we're also planning to branch out into adding resources for each genre/franchise  so we'd welcome articles on (say) how to adapt Squid Game as an RPG  or whatever else you might want to write about.  Again  you would need to be good at writing *for others*  which is a different skill than taking notes for yourself ... but if you can  this might be a great way to help other gamers with your ""compulsion""."
1233,I have a 1992 blazer.  [Did you picture this? ](https://m.imgur.com/Weomouj). Or did you picture the s10 blazer?  Because they both existed at the same time  and different parts stores will call different ones Blazer.  The other one will either be s10 blazer or k1500 blazer.  The only way to know if its the right truck is go through to the engine selection because thankfully the s10 didn't come with a 350.
1234,I have a 2017 Jetta  the last model year of the MK6. Its a very solid car. Has a good amount of torque from the 1.4T engine. Its very fuel efficient as well  plus i dont need premium fuel - only regular 87 octane. I average about 38 mpg on my daily commute.
1235,I have a few recommendations that are relatively low-magic  but heavy on the history. These are all very Eurocentric  but if anybody has recommendations focusing on other cultures  I would love to see them.   *Night Witches*  It's a historical fiction RPG about the Soviet squads of women aviators that did bombing runs against the Nazis.  *Wolves of God*  You're badass medieval adventurers in post-Roman Britain.  *Sagas Of The Icelanders*  You're Norsemen who have set foot on Iceland  and now  you must tell the story of how you make it your home.  *Dream Apart*  You are all Jewish residents of a *shetl*  an enclave for you and your family against the hostile anti-semitism of 19th century Eastern Europe.  *Good Society*  This is basically the Jane Austen RPG. Play as the classy and the sassy young bachelors and bachelorettes in the literature of regency era England.
1236,I have a kei car  where the engine was originally developed for a racing series. It was then detuned to meet the kei car requirements.  Destroking it was one of the things Daihatsu did when modifying the engine.
1237,I have a laptop that stays on the bootup screen when i turn it on for 5 minutes. It used to be my dads laptop but he gave it to me. He said that he did a bios reset but it didnt change anything. He also said that google had a update for the computer and thats how it was caused. Anybody know why?
1238,I have a stock s2k.   I burned a CD with the initial d soundtrack since the car doesnt have Bluetooth or audio jack. The CD works in my outback but doesnt work in the s2k. The s2k radio works with regular CDs Ive bought so Im confused what the issue is. 21 year old car btw.
1239,I have a super nasty one that went to bare metal right above my windshield   and it has started to rust. Ive sanded it down and applied touch up but it always comes back. So no  rust is not fun on a car especially if it starts to bubble up and spread
1240,"I have a tendency to just be blunt.   ""If you feel the need to cheat  so be it.  But it's really pointless. And you're just going to ruin the game for the rest of us""  Then when the person protests that they aren't cheating  I either just look at them silently  or I shrug and say ""I said 'if'... it's entirely up to you whether you cheat or not."" And then I move on.   With new players  especially the ""I need to win"" types  I'll say something to this effect before we ever start playing."
1241,I have a ton of RPG pdfs that I have been amassing through sales and bundles and I've been trying to figure out the most economical way of printing them out. I have used Lulu before and the price point is pretty good  but the system is so fickle with how the PDFs need to be processed that I feel I spend more time getting them just right (embedded font issues  all the pages need to be exact dimensions  cover page templates is difficult to work with  etc...) that it's not worth the time. If I try to get pdfs printed at the Staples/Office max it is a fortune to print out anything in color. I have printed out pdfs at home/work and have them spiral bound at the office supply store with some of my collections that have come out alright  but looking for a bit more professional look. Is there any other economical online service that anyone can suggest that I can do a perfect bound  saddle stich  hard cover for a reasonable price but the ease of uploading files like at Staples/Office Depot?
1242,"I have a very similar experience when I'm the GM  I even tell people that I exoect a bit of hanging out after the game and won't GM if everyone just leave.   I don't know for you  but for me it's the gap between players and Gm that cause this. Since I'm not part of ""the crew"" during the game  I end up feeling used if everyone leave right away. Don't get me wrong  I enjoy GMing  I'm not adversorial and I'm very much in the ""the GM is also a player"" camp. But the GM is a player  not a Player.   The GM has more power to make the game bad which translates to more responsability. My NPCs are not main characters so I have to hold back some of my most flamboyant ideas. After a big victory I can celebrate with the table but it's not my victory  it's often the end of ""my character"" or ""my organisation"" and it's now time to get back to work restarting the machine with a great hook. It's fun but it's also work and in a way it's a bit like seeing friends on your workplace  you're not a 100% enjoying their presence."
1243,I have achieved as low as 5.3 l/100km in my 17 GTI manual loaded up for a weekend vacation with my wife. That puts it low 40s mpg. This isn't surprising to me a Jetta will do that with a smaller engine.
1244,"I have always found colors to be tough.  I know good color when I see it  but I have always struggled with generating a good color palette and sticking to it.    In my most recent project  I have severely limited my color palette to 16 colors  and I am working from that.  I've found that very helpful  as it seems to tie everything in the game together  more  rather than making it look like a bunch of random objects.    I think it was Orson Wells who said something like ""limitations are the key to creativity "" and this has consistently been a source of inspiration for me.  By setting clear limits  it requires you to get creative about how you are going to convey the things you want to  and this will naturally bring out new and interesting ideas.  Limiting to 16 colors and 64x64 textures has been my most recent challenge  and I am really enjoying it."
1245,I have an 08 accord coupe V6 and it still has a lot of room for a coupe. Fun enough as a commuter  Gets good gas mileage. Compromised handling for sure but I just drive it back and forth to work. That being said I never want a coupe. Just what I found in manual for a daily.
1246,I have an asus h570 prime plus using xmpII and 10700kf  team ssd m.2  win10  and will NOT boot to uefi  but im a newbie  LOL  never tried to make it happen either. Reversing position didnt work. I also installed a windows ultimate performance option setting.
1247,"I have an issue with that  it's harder for the PC to break the world and you're limited to ""second roles"" character.  I mean  *Luke Skywalker destroyed the death-star*. Off course you don't have to do an epic campaign  may-be it's more interesting to play a bunch of enlisted part othe 3rd Imperial training Squadron on Tatooine which will discover the true face of the empire and will have to choose between loyalty to their family and *becoming the good guys* and in that case the Star-Wars event are just some ""big things happening far away"". To stay in the Star wars universe  you could also take the whole extended universe and play quite far away from the main arc.   But then what's the point of playing ""Star Wars ?""  I would add a second issue   Not everybody knows every ""established""world in details.  Have you seen *Babylon 5* ? The *Loddos chronicle* ? Read the *quest for the time bird ?*   In the end you have one player who is a fan of the world and knows details even the GM doesn't  one who know roughly what the world is about  and one player who has no idea except that idea looked nice (No need to read *the mouse guard* books to be interested by the idea of playing mices*)*    Having an original universe let you break the world if you want.  You want the emperor to take a radical political decision or to have the barbarian roaming your world ? Go for it. One PC might be a world fan and complain but you don't have a whole cannon universe to reffer"
1248,I have an RP & character-study focused group  so we choose systems based on genre and story need. Recently  I made a slasher horror PbtA hack to fit a series of one shots. D&D just wasnt conducive to our group play style. Its unlikely well go back  since there are options that just fit my group better.
1249,I have an SSD  and an HDD. Windows is installed on the SSD and I was wondering if I could install my programs and apps on the HDD to save space. But will this have an impact on the performance of the apps?  HDDs are far slower  and this is why I was wondering if the apps will run slower too because they're being read from the HDD.  So  is it fine to install stuff on the HDD or should I stick to installing stuff on the SSD instead?  &#x200B;  Thanks.
1250,I have been a Final Fantasy fan for the last 22 years  but the franchise that deserves this shoutout the most is  without a doubt  Golden Sun.  Such a unique take on magic  world building  class system and special dungeons. If I could ask for a full remake of any game (leaving Final Fantasy IX aside)  I would definitely ask for a Golden Sun 1 + 2 remake for Nintendo Switch. And then a redo on Dark Dawn with a proper closing.
1251,I have been watching anime ever since i was a little kid. started actually picking and choosing series when i was 14  now im 32 and i can say ive seen all the classics and i know what types i like and dont. And its rly sad because theres nothing to watch anymore that will make me feel like berserk  hxh  death note  one punch man etc Just new animes that are so similar. Havent found anything intresting in years
1252,I have found the best way to mitigate the temptation is just to play campaigns with set end points  be those in-game timers or real-world ones.   Not only does that mean as the GM you dont have to contend with the challenge of keeping a game fresh and interesting for innumerable sessions  but it also incentivises the players to get on with doing the things they want to do. If theres a plot hook theyre interested in  they should chase it up now because were only going to play this for 6 months and then well wrap it up.   Obviously you can adjust up or down how long you want to play something for during the breaks  maybe the next game will be a year long  or only over winter  but having those set end points means I dont get burned out on playing the same thing forever  and my players dont get unpleasantly surprised when I want to play something else.   In addition  when a game is shelved  we keep as much of the material together as possible  and keep the option open to play the same game again a bit later  when weve had time to play something else and gather some more inspiration.
1253,"I have grown up with the FF franchise and it was once one of my favorites but at this point the name carries zero weight with me whatsoever.    IV  VI  IX  and XII are my personal favorites but the shine really started to lose its luster for me at VII.  I know most people love that one but I didn't think the writing was this spectacular work of art and also I believe this was the first time a video game made me sit back and say to myself ""the hell with that  it's too much work"".    Even though VII was a low point  FFX really started the downhill trend in my eyes as I couldn't stand Titus  and with him being the main protag of course  I couldn't get away from him.  I hated his character design  his voice  and his script.  So much.  My hate for Titus really detracted from all the other things that game did well  I have to admit.  And I have not been able to get on board since.  I have dabbled in all the subsequent games  even XIV in fits and starts but it just doesn't stick anymore.  I think that there was an opportunity to get me back with XV.. I know there is a good game in there somewhere.. but I am not a fan of having to piece together a story from various sources before I have an inkling of whatever is supposed to be going on.    I know it sounds like I'm being super negative but I do still really love IV and VI especially  and also IX and XII.  For me  if 4 out of 15 are good  is that a successful franchise?  I don't know.  But it feels like there has been more trash than treasure overall."
1254,I have launched a new RPG which I have based in the 1980s in an alternate reality  thirty years after a great war.   A cold war now simmers  though  and the race is on to secure your countrys future; to either be the single controlling power in the world or to strive for world peace. Each player takes on the role of a countrys leader alongside a team of Trusted Aides  making decisions on behalf of their people. The Games Master (GM) controls the Non-Player Governments (NPGs) as a sequence of events threaten to rock the fragile state of the world.    **The question is this: Is this an era that people would be interested in? Or are we still focused on Fantasy and Sci-fi?**  Don't feel you have to but the campaign can be seen here:  [https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/drmgames/war-within-rpg-set-in-a-tense-cold-war-arena](https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/drmgames/war-within-rpg-set-in-a-tense-cold-war-arena)
1255,I have long believed that making a game is harder than a lot of other software disciplines for a number of reasons.  1. You're dealing with the intersection of more disciplines. Visual design  programming systems  physics  sound  marketing  game design.     2. Games generally have a lot more action verbs than most other systems.     3. Games are entertainment driven  which usually has a higher bar than just 'interact to update documents/view information'     4. There are so many excellent games to compare your own to  so progress can feel harder to make.    5. Most game concepts can't be accomplished alone  so you have to work with others.      It's a lot of work but keep at it!
1256,I have mac laptop but unfortunately i cant expand the storage and i can longer update my software. I am also trying to get into coding and I need to be able to upgrade my storage. I love my mac cuz it never overheats and the fan is really quiet. I want to buy something that is $1000 or preferably less that will be good for coding  quiet fan and lots of storage space or the ability to add more later when needed. Any advice? I don't particularly like windows but if it's just for programming I might be ok with it. Thanks for the help.
1257,"I have multiple reason why I left D&D  and multiple reasons why I stuck with my game of choice (Cortex Prime)  well it is more of a toolkit for system/game creation than it is a game itself  but w.e.  Why I left D&D:    \#1 it is too combat focused  most abilities and and feats and things about character are about combat. If we wanted to go off the beaten path and have quite a few sessions without combat  it is just down to skill rolls mostly  a few spells help. But it feels that combat is far more fleshed out with mechanics than anything else.  \#2. The power scaling  they did help with most things from older editions in the modifiers being lower but HP still scale too much  it is just a lot of work on the GMs part to scale everything else to the characters. Also it breaks my immersion if  as a high level character  I can stand hands-on-hips in a hoard of goblins and not worry.  \#3 d20  I was always a fan of a curved dice mechanic  and a d20 is too ""swingy""  \#4 Hit Points I really have an issue with this  you are all fine and dandy until you are dead  no in between.  \#5 Genre specific  I like to play other genres and changing it to fit other genres is a LOT of work  there are games that did this for you  like Esper Genesis  for Sci-Fi but it just feels like D&D.  Why I chose Cortex Prime:  \#1 Dice mechanic  I get to use all my dice (except the d20) and a lot of them and it is a pool and it has a curve. Also so little math  no more modifiers everything is just built into the dice mechanic  \#2 Any setting  any genre  it can work with anything and each game can feel different from one another  one of the benefits of it being a ""toolkit""  \#3 Mechanics evenly distributed for all aspects of gameplay  it not only handles the crunch of combat well but it is also a narrative game as well. You can actually have cool mechanics unique to your character about their personality  relationships  or anything really.  \#4 VERY hard to break the game. A lot of the mechanics are self balancing and you can allow and execute a lot of customizability without worry of completely breaking the game.  \#5 A LOT of options for tweaking the game to your liking  you can make it as crunchy or as narrative as you like."
1258,I have my Huawei Nova 5T for almost two years  with an 6'2 LC display. I tested scrolling the screen in landscape mode for the first time  and yes  it has also the jello effect  but not really an *end of the world* situation.   I think most LC display out there do this effect ever since  but people really not paying attention until now.
1259,I have never been able to stick with any CRPGs besides DOS2.  But I play a lot of dungeon RPGs where I have to pick the race/class/stats for a bunch of characters up front.    I think it's best just to pick a class that sounds appealing to you and not lose sleep over anything not immediately important for that class.  I'm not going to worry about fucking up persuasion checks if I want to be a refrigerator that smashes everyone.  I'm not going to worry about not having ranged weapons if my goal is to be so chunky that I can tank a few spells while running in.  Pick one direction and run with it.  You can always lower the difficulty if the game is making it a chore to play your preferred method  e.g. if you're expected to quest and negotiate for more EXP when you just wanted a combat class.   The game exists for your enjoyment.  You are not beholden to its restrictions if you don't find those restrictions more fun.
1260,I have never owned a fwd car but they can be fun. Simple  light and inexpensive are things that are essential for the economy car market  but they are traits that work well for the performance car/coupe market as well. Thats why it makes sense to sometimes base performance cars on economy cars.
1261,I have never scream fuccck so loud when someone is talking about going to take a field trip with his family. The death flag raise so dam high  enemy can see it.  They really gotta stop killing character with Eugene who is a friend of the mc. They die in such brutal ways too.
1262,I have never watched an anime but I saw that Cowboy Bebop was coming out to Netflix and it just looked like a cool and special show. Wanted to try an anime for a while but didn't know what to start with. what do you think?
1263,I have no context into what gmtk has or has not done. And I only can speak for my personal experience. The question here is what do you consider making a game? Today I have currently never made a game. However I have written character stats systems  character controllers  AI systems  networking code and other assets that other developers are using in their game and had a brief stint in QA. So the question here is is that experience irrelevant? Does that make our insight any less useful?
1264,I have no doubt Intel still dont have amazing yields on I7  but a bigger problem for GPU's is that this lack of maturity and development means they're still behind on efficiency and performance compared to TSMC 7.  They \*need\* TSMC to be properly competitive.  Nvidia only got away with using Samsung 8nm because they were far ahead enough in terms of architecture to know they can still compete on it(though this will not be the case going forward).
1265,I have no interest in learning games systems. For my current campaign I forced myself to read several (GURPS  Hero  Savage Worlds  Mythras  Astonishing Swordsmen...of Hyperborea etc). I've settled on Hero and I've no desire to change.
1266,I have no problem buying AC Delco parts for my non-GM vehicle  but I won't buy a GM.  Is this just marketing  or is there any basis for my feeling that ac Delco parts are fine but GM as a whole is not?
1267,I have observed a paradox: the RPGs which gave me the most fun in the past  are less and less appealing to me. Conversely  the new narrative systems have a lot of solutions that I love  but also some that ruin most of the fun. I wrote a post about this phenomenon on my blog [https://castelviator.wordpress.com/2021/10/12/separation-of-powers-and-immersion-in-rpg-eng/](https://castelviator.wordpress.com/2021/10/12/separation-of-powers-and-immersion-in-rpg-eng/) and I invite you to discussion :)
1268,"I have only watched FMAB out of all 3 options so it's actually the only choice for me although it is really not that gory  If I have to suggest from all the anime I would probably go with re zero first half of the first episode is not that good as it is kinda way to light hearted at that time but from around the ending of first episode things get really good  Another Choice would be tokyo ghoul really great anime second season is kinda confusing but still one of the greatest anime Warning: last season ""kind of"" shows a sex scene which you probably won't be comfortable watching with your mom"
1269,I have owned and sold a Jeep XJ  97 4Runner  and a C5 Corvette. All 3 have gone up in value and are considered classics  beside maybe the C5  but it will get there. I regret selling them  especially the 4runner.
1270,I have played Kingmaker on Xbox One and now on Series X. It works fine. It's a great game!!!    In March Pathfinder: Wrath of Righteous comes to consoles which I will get also though I'm currently playing it on PC. WotR is better in my opinion that Kingmaker. But Kingmaker is still a great game.   Feel free to ask me any questions if you want.
1271,I have pretty much never given a single shit about it  particularly with jrpgs. Here's the dirty secret: weapons  armor and grinding are rarely more powerful or time efficient than buying a bajillionty recovery items and saving all your magic points for glorious  glorious offense. I'd rather the plot have some twists and turns than be assured that my loot will always be in the same place.  Plus  when it comes to bioware games--specifically Jade Empire  Kotor & ME1--I actually started feeling like they were erring on the side of player empowerment too often for the characters to still feel real to me. ME2 pushed Garrus from the bottom of my Mass Effect power rankings to the top just by virtue of him deciding he didn't actually give a fuck about any of the shit I taught him in the first game. Was that really intentional or simply the path of least resistance for the writers? I don't know and I don't even care; it was just refreshing to have someone around who wasn't willing to change up their whole career path because I had done some sidequests and did some paragon flavored mentoring.
1272,I have ran a couple time Maze Rats for 5 yo and up. My wife run it with the autistic kids youngest class she did was 7 yo. ICRPG run well starting age 9-10  could be as low as 6 yo if the kid can read a few words as the game use cards it's quite simple and contains a small line of text  3-4 words for the item description and maybe 10-12 words for the effect on item with a lot of text. As you are limited to 10 items it's short and simple.  Both are narrative forward systems so it's very well suited for kids and people with imagination.
1273,I have seen many 4k monitors at this size  however I still don't get it. ~138 ppi isn't too much for regular PC usage?  I know in Windows you can scale it so something like 125%  so it would be about 110dpi  but wouldn't that make the image blurry since it's non-integer scaling?
1274,"I have that problem  I get excited by new rules systems and settings  and want to try them out. Thankfully  I have a sort of ""sub group"" of my main group that loves to try new stuff out  so I just experiment with them. If they like the system/setting  we introduce it to our main groups."
1275,"I have the same thoughts but I just tell myself ""oh  that's cool  I'll have to remember that"" then I forget it later  haha. Rarely I will miss a few minutes of a movie while lost in thought and have to rewind."
1276,I have this issue with my computer and the internet. Whenever I play a game or watch a stream my internet cuts out for a few seconds. I've talked with my internet provider 3-4 times and one of them said that my computer is sending something corrupted to the router and its bad which is causing it to disconnect from the internet. The only thing I can think of is to do a factory reset on my computer  everything else in my household internet works perfectly fine so I know its related to my computer.     Anybody know what is causing this problem and is there any other solution before I commit to factory resetting my computer?     [My Specs](https://preview.redd.it/kkgxlahr0st71.png?width=800&format=png&auto=webp&s=deb97330fa6e197f19e2f5700f865c6a5f456bfd)
1277,I have to remind myself that as a GM  I spend about 10x as much time as my players on a given system. I spend hours reading bestiaries  adventures  looking over their character sheets  thinking about what I want to do  reflecting on the adventure  etc.  I now go into campaigns assuming I'll be bored. I don't choose the system I want because I love it  because my mind will wander. I will find something new by the third adventure that I love even more. So if I choose a system that I'm ready to run when it's my fifth choice  then it probably won't fall below my fifth choice.
1278,I have two contradictory suggestions:   **(1) Background setting dressing.** The players are travelling through pirate-infested space  but you don't want *yet another fight*. Maybe they come across a derelict ship. If they explore/scan it  you can tell them that the blast marks are consistent with a struggle  that all the valuables have been looted...   The idea is that you're giving them hints about the location that they're going to/going through. You don't need to have fully-fledged plot hooks  but think of them as plot-teases.      **(2) The Montage.** This is less work for you  the DM  but requires more trust for the players. Randomize the order of your players; each one invents a problem or difficulty that they encounter  and the next player solves that problem. This one is nice because the players can invent their own content  but it doesn't work as well with players that show less initiative.
1279,"I haven't even watched the video yet. but as soon as he said  ""it's not made in america"" that hurt considering what it looks like (from the outside so far) and the fact that it's awd and 261 horsepower. damn."
1280,I haven't got much useful to contribute here  other than to say I asked a similar question of the developer of Curious Expedition.  They put some simple unlockables for famous youtubers/streamers so they can play as 'themselves' or use a themed unit around them etc. to surprise their fans/entice them to play the game.   Thread here.  [https://www.reddit.com/r/gamedev/comments/q7ea54/complete\_revenue\_history\_of\_modest\_indie\_hit\_game/hgjivwv/?context=3](https://www.reddit.com/r/gamedev/comments/q7ea54/complete_revenue_history_of_modest_indie_hit_game/hgjivwv/?context=3)  Good luck
1281,I haven't played Solasta but I have finished both Kingmaker and WotR. 110 hours in KM and 150 or so hours in WotR. I did enjoy other CRPGs like D:OS2 and PoE2 but never got around to finishing them.  For what it's worth the only new-ish CRPGs that I have played to completion are the Pathfinder games and Wasteland 3. One common theme between these is the idea of bunkering down in a home base and I only really play turnbased. I also enjoy the character building complexity. It's a bit daunting and sometimes gives me a bit of choice paralysis but only on subsequent playthroughs. I always stubbornly pick some type of caster with a focus on ice/cold spells if I can no matter what.  I did a Kineticist run in  KM and a Leyline Guardian/Winter Witch with Azata Mythic in Wrath.  I'm in the early stages of doing a second Lich playthrough of Wrath because the Mythic system gives way for quite a bit of replayability
1282,I havent played WotR  but I did enjoy Solasta quite a bit. It is mostly focused around tactical combat  which it does quite well. Dont expect elaborate dialogue trees or a sandbox adventure. It took me a bit over 50 hours to complete  thoroughly exploring areas and doing all the missions. The negatives I found were that the reagent management and crafting is a hassle  Fly behaves oddly in some places  the ending felt a little anticlimactic and I encountered a few bugs along the way.
1283,I haven't purchased any of the IP-tie-in RPGs since the Indiana Jones RPG so can't comment but I would be worried that they would limit creativity and rather than having a unique experience it would be reliving the source material.
1284,I haven't read a book in years. I think the last one I read was Dan Brown's *Inferno*.  It's hard for me to focus on text on a page sometimes and I absolutely despise reading on my phone or tablet. Having something electronic that mimics an actual book where I can enlarge the text to help focus better might be beneficial.
1285,I haven't seen anyone mentioning the Stalker game from Burger Games: https://www.burgergames.com/stalker/EN_web/  Looks good and rules for adding the dice roll also exist but the base game is 100% diceless.  It's based on the famous novel. You may heard about this IP from the PC games series which was also based on Roadside Picnic.
1286,I hear you  and while I personally kind of enjoy the concept on occasion because I like to work within constraints  I do understand the pain of losing something you put so much effort into without any promise of getting it back.  If you're curious how this trope might be done well  consider The Legend of Heroes: Trails of Cold Steel. The MC's are all students at a military academy and are sent off on different work assignment trips to 'broaden their horizons.' There's 9 characters in the class to start  and in order to spread things out they break the class up into two groups each week. You as the MC lead one half of the class and the other half goes off-screen for the duration of the story beat. This allows you  the player  to experience the character dynamics between the MC and the other characters in smaller  episodic bits and get to know them a bit more personally. It's a neat take on the 'splitting up the party' trope that I thought was done rather well.
1287,I honestly cant process this. I know nothings been announced  but Remedys always said that they was to make an AW2  just not right now  but I just figured it really wouldnt ever happen. Hard to believe its been 10+ years already.
1288,I honestly don't think i'd change anything.  The whole point  is the journey and the experience.  I'm not sure there's anything i could *tell myself* that would change anything.  If i could go back and give myself piles of money...sure  maybe i do something differently.  But as it stands...i'm pretty confident i did the best i could with what i had.  And i'm happy with that.
1289,I honestly have this I just never played it and I'm afraid to because I hear with all this hype that it might not be as great as I think. Kind of the same reason I haven't played half life past the 1st one
1290,I honestly love the styling of my car IRL since it's so tiny but has big wheels and a lot of clearance  but  well... it's a Caliber. Even if it was reliable and could actually pass cars on single lane highways  the inside is still made up of melted down Happy Meal toys.  Fieros are an easy one.  The XJ220 is future AF  people will admire the hell out of it as it slowly passes by them while you push your $650 000 super car to the nearest service station.  The Prowler is another controversial one  just doesn't have the internals to even justify its styling. Like with other cars that's disappointing  but this is an attainable IRL Hot Wheels  so it's downright insulting. If that shit was performance  suddenly its goofiness would be hype AF.
1291,I honestly think there's just so much good stuff this season that even if it were really good it would probably be better to keep up with stuff that's currently airing  but I'm always glad to hear that someone enjoyed a show that didn't get a ton of attention
1292,I hope MC never loses his edgy chuuni asshole personality. His lines are quite entertaining. It seems like those three will be the main cast and the story will go forward next episode  hopefully showing more ridiculous aspects of Not-Battle-City.  I really dig the music  though it feels like it would fit better for a SciFi/thriller.
1293,I hope my question is in the right place because everyone says AC Odyssey is an RPG  right? I don't know much about Assassin's Creed  but Odyssey seems fun for someone like me who's interested in Greek Mythology. Should I give a chance to this game or it's just more of the same? I'm just a little afraid of the game gets boring quickly because I'm looking for an RPG to play for months.   Ah  and of course  I already played Elder Scrolls  The Witcher  Dragon Age  Fallout  Mass Effect  etc  and I'd love all of them.
1294,I hope that these announcements / rumours point towards Remedy building a joined universe across Alan Wake  Control and Quantum Break.   I play through Alan Wake once every year and still love it's unique tone and atmosphere  but a shared world would be just awesome.
1295,I hope this comes to full fruition some day.  I have damn nostalgia binoculars for Oblivion. Would sink hundreds of hours into Skyblivion based on what they've shown.  Bethesda should contribute to development after Starfield is launched. I know people want TESVI but by the time Starfield is out Skyblivion will likely be pretty damn far along and it would be cool if Bethesda could help polish it up.  They won't. Im fully aware of that  but it would be cool.
1296,I hope this ends up being simething like the destroy all humans remaster while they change some things for QOL  improvements and added cut content that fits in well with the story. While also making sure to take note that the hardest missions in the game are easier and some are made harder. Like the nuke mission in destroy all humans. I hate those landmines with a passion.
1297,I hope to god they dont absolutely butcher these. These games are extremely important pieces of art that deserve the praise for generations to come. These games are on the same level as Half Life and Deus Ex  important milestone achievements and I hope they dont throw it all away with these remasters.
1298,I jumped around a few tutorials when starting out of course  but now most of my learning comes from personal challenges  ideas I try to implement (fail faster)  and looking up the answer to every stray curiosity. I might be going no where fast  but I know a ton more than I did when I really dug into coding about a year ago. Reading some of the other comments has me acknowledging the gaps in my understanding and my being likely amateur. But that's ok  because every day is a step closer. I've accomplished some pretty neat stuff and it's always fun and rewarding.  Imo  proficiency and mastery are certainly more difficult on one's own  but not unobtainable. Being self taught  the only price you have to pay is time and determination. That said  if I could afford a teacher  I totally would take courses.    I believe the disadvantage is mostly self-imposed. There's soo many resources out there that are free or cheap. Programming communities are prolific  YouTube is full of lessons and other info  and for every version of a thing  the educational resources for the previous become easier to obtain. But as others have said or implied  it's easy to get stuck or miss out on important things without a dedicated guide and professional structure.  Best of luck to you!
1299,I just bought a kit to convert a 2080 FE into water cooled. I figure it's going to be a while before affordable and faster gpus are available  so why not try to eke more out of what you already have.  Between that and little upgrades here and there (faster ram  better ssd) it's been barely palatable considering this a rewarding hobby.
1300,I just bought Elex on sale  steam for $10 and it's great so far. I'm about 12 hours in and choices matter  combat is decent  good banter  definitely worth 10 bucks. Traversal is pretty hard because they give you a jetpack so lockout certain areas with very strong creatures that will destroy you until you have the gear.
1301,I just don't play in licensed worlds  even if I end up using a system for one. It's just not an interest for me and my group as a homebrewer. I prefer original but even better for me is a system that focuses on tone and themes over explicit setting so I can fill that in myself.
1302,I just finished a playthrough of **Arcanum: Of Steamworks and Magick Obscura**  and now I'm starting another playthrough of **Wasteland 3** in anticipation of its final upcoming DLC. Also playing **Diablo II: Resurrected** on the side when I just need those lighter moments to turn my brain off and grind.
1303,"I just finished it today.  It's unique and I love how it started.  About halfway through  it went a direction I kind of suspected but I didn't expect the drastic change the story took.  Some of the comcepts were a bit confusing at times and  even reading all the provided texts  there were a couple concepts I was never really exactly clear on.  I love  love  love the way it handles deductions.  It's not the first game I've seen do it this way but it is a mechanic I love.  You gather clues and put them together to reach your deduction.  The deduction mechanic  lack of inventory  and limited character development make it feel more like a detective game than an rpg at times.  The minimalist handling of inventory and advancement  while not exactly like Disco Elysium  are reminiscent of it.  There are a lot of text bugs...mostly in the codex with things like links.  There were also several instances of the wrong pronoun being used for my character but it could be argued that it was an in-game mistake revolving around other characters assuming the real world gender of my character.  My only real complaint is about the ending (no spoilers).  The end choices were dependent upon prior choices (so far  so good).  Some of those seemed to contradict each other (i.e. you can't have choice 1 because you did A but you also can't have choice 2 because you DIDN'T do A).  Ultimately  I only had one choice at the end.  One problem with playing this game as an rpg as a character with a particular personality is that you'll be limited in advancing your skills.  Skills are advanced by ""spending"" points you gain in one of four aspects.  You'll need at least some of all four aspects to advance most of the skill trees.  So if you play your character a particular way you may find you have a lot of points in one or two aspects and not enough in the others.  Sorry for the ramble.  All in all  I liked it.  It wasn't perfect and could use some polish.  It's not as good as Disco Elysium  imo  but it did scratch that detective itch better than Disco Elysium did for me (and so few games do ""detective"" well).  I'm happy I played and I probably will play it again just to see what happens if I make different choices."
1304,I just got into crpgs like 6 months ago with divinity 2. Since Ive played disco Elesium and just finished Wasteland 3 a couple days ago. I really like how much emphasis is put on the dialogue and writing in general. My biggest problem with Wasteland 3 was that you can barely communicate with your party. I wanted to get to know the characters but after introductions you barely talk at all to them. I let Vic join my party because hes hilarious and has the most personality despite being an awful person
1305,"I just recently picked up D20 GO and it seems like a pretty chill system.  There's a [quickstart version for free](https://www.drivethrurpg.com/product/333444/D20-Go-Quick-Rules?manufacturers_id=17993) or [the full rules for under $10 as a pdf](https://www.drivethrurpg.com/product/330947/D20-Go). There are also Pay What You Want ""System Hacks"" for Sci-fi and Apocalypse/Post-Apocalypse style games called Star20 and Z20."
1306,I just released Chapter 2 of my indie game on Steam.  It is a **text-based / ASCII adventure** with some **turn-based combat**. It can be hard at first  but there is a lot of diversity in the paths you can take.  You can use physical attacks  spells  or miracles (based on the god you choose).  It is currently [on sale](https://store.steampowered.com/app/1055950/Feels/) at 0.99$  but it is also **DRM free** (I dont think I can upload it myself without violating Steams TOS  but maybe some good soul in the comments could share its files).  I would really appreciate anyone giving it a try and would love to hear some feedback.
1307,I just sold an IROC-Z Camaro that I owned for ten years. It was a nice car  very original and in great shape. What I didnt expect was to sell it for 2.5x what I paid for it back in 2011  after having only done normal maintenance stuff to it over the decade I owned it.  I guess the once mullet mobiles have started to become more appreciated in recent years.
1308,"I just think NDAs are stupid for publicity... if you're sjowing it to people not actively developing it  you should show it to everyone. None of this ""VIP access"" bullshit just for another shooter. This shit pissed me off with Cyberpunk  too.  I dont get the people who defend it either. Its like you're against being given more information on the product they're wanting to sell. It makes no sense to defend this practice.  Edot: obviously  if you sign s contract you should abide by its rules. That i am for. But i think NDAs as a concept are asinine."
1309,"I just turned 47. I'm running a 5e game with a group of whom no one is over 35 -- some of 'em were born in the mid-90s. And it's a blast. You know why?  **Because I'm running it like I'd run any** ***other*** **edition of D&D**. I'm keeping the players engaged with the same things that used to engage us in the 2nd Edition days  and that's where our common ground is. We're just having fun.  Turns out  except for not having an encyclopedic knowledge of New Wave music and The Alan Parsons Project  these kids (I say ""kids"" but they're adults) ain't that different from people I woulda played with 25 years ago. (And they dress better. Jesus  remember the mid-1990s?! Jeans like freaking *tents* hangin' offa people's butts?! Yeeech. I'm trying *not* to.) They still dig fighting giant spiders and digging into their characters' motivations  I'm still winging my way through a dungeon  and we're still bringing drinks and snacks to share.  The face of the hobby  and the tone of the rules -- those things have changed. But the heart of it? What you can do with it?  Same as it ever was.  Oh -- and now that we're getting to be friends  and they're starting to trust my old guy knowledge? They're expressing interest in other games besides 5e. Even in older games.   Same as it ever was."
1310,I just want versus lik l4d2 the rest of it I really dont care for. The beta was fun once or twice but I'm tired of coop looter shooters  and I want linear versus like l4d2. I put easily over 4k hours that  game  made great friends and I am not a fan of zombies in anyway.
1311,I keep a list of rumors. Sometimes I will roll  sometimes I dont.  Rumors are dropped due to down time  things heard over that time. Sometimes a specific interaction. Sometimes I give them to the party  often I give them to individuals and enjoy watching them try to paraphrase or purposely twist it.
1312,I knew a hard cut to Eugene was inevitable  I Honeslty thought they were gonna go with a shot with his eyes full of life and wonder  then a hard cut to just dead eyes and blood everywhere  gotta say that Necklace cut hurt deep. Maaaaaan..
1313,I knew the sideship would come into play but I didn't expect this much this soon!!  [](#akyuusqueel)  I think I like them more than the main ship right now since their feelings for each other already seem pretty open to each other?
1314,I know a good amount of GMs that use Japanese style Videogame RPG maps  and sprites for their RPG games. It works like you you want. You can even get programs like RPGMaker  to make your own maps  and export them to image files. Then add to Roll20  or any VTT and then add tokens or in this case Video game Sprits  heck even make your own. You can take it a step further and do what I did with my Streetfighter RPG setup  for FoundryVTT [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4MurDMcg3HM](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4MurDMcg3HM) Also did a similar thing with an Aliens RPG setup [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nx\_A1YP3794](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nx_A1YP3794)
1315,I know a guy who bought a new 1966 Ford Bronco to pull his airplane in and out of the hanger.  It has always been inside the heated and cooled hanger  gets started and warmed up to move the plane weekly  very rarely has ever gotten wet  is always kept clean.  It looks brand new.  Literally the perfect way to store a vehicle for long term. and has something like 12 000 miles on it.  His son has recently realized what they have.  Many people have asked to buy it  they aren't selling.  He  bought it as a tool for a few thousand and now it is worth more than a hundred thousand  possibly two hundred thousand.
1316,I know an example of this. Knight Squad 2 and Knight Squad 2 trials.  Knight Squad 2 is the paid version  and Knight Squad 2 trials is the free/demo version(limited maps/gamemodes).  it's a 8 player arcade style game  and the cool thing about the paid vs free version is  if one player has the paid version  then they can invite anyone with the free version to play with them with all the paid version features.
1317,I know its long after Harry Potter's prime but it honestly surprises me that there was never a game on the series where you create your own character and go through your years at Hogwarts.   I know there's that Hogwarts mystery game but I'm talking a actually game not a phone game with a time recharge.   Like I could create a character that is in Ravenclaw and solve some mysteries going through my years in between classes or the like but we never really got something of the sort.
1318,I know San Andreas is the best version of these 3  while Vice city is one of the most loved  but 3 for me is my absolute favorite  even among the most recent releases.  Sitting down watching the game for the first time  I knew I was seeing history and endless possibilities. Plus sick D&B station.   I hope and pray they put time into these games with some added mechanics that came with the Releases of the psp Stories games.  I need to be able to bail from a car in GTA3.
1319,I know some official services for coolant will be a drain  fill and bleed procedure. So the total amount of coolant removed will be low  so the service window will be shortened up.   Either way  35 000 seems really early.
1320,I know this as an MMO but couldn't find a rule against it. I've not played an MMO in around a decade but have an urge to try this one.  I've just had re-ran through PoE1 and played through Deadfire back to back so wouldn't mind a break from single player RPG's.  Any of you played it and if so what are your thoughts on the gameplay (Most reviews are just people complaining about the queues)?   How is the grind on it? - I've seen a few people complain about generic copy and pasted fetch quests.   Also how is crafting? - Does the economy work (If it's not too early to say)?  This community has been spot on in pretty much all recommendations so interested in your thoughts. Please delete if rule 1 doesn't cover MMO's.
1321,I know this isn't the most in depth RPG in the traditional sense but Red Dead Redemption 2 has an amazing game world to explore and role play in. I never thought I was going to like it  but was blown away by it.
1322,I know this sounds weird because I'm an anime subreddit asking for anime  but I think that anime is gotten to where some of these anime tropes are so commonly over used that it makes anime so stale and boring. So I'm sort of looking for an anime that breaks away from these tropes and it feels like it could have been made anywhere I'm a big fan one punch man attack on Titan monster code Geass steins gate Dr Stone mob psycho
1323,I know what you mean! If you want to be a game developer there's no option but to get used to (temporarily) feeling like a failure and battling through each dead end.   I recently wrote a blog post about my struggle to implement a minor feature in my map-generating system. By now I'm used to these struggles  I'm sure they won't stop until the game is finally done!   [https://plasmabeamgames.wordpress.com/2021/09/24/natural-planets-v6/](https://plasmabeamgames.wordpress.com/2021/09/24/natural-planets-v6/)
1324,I know you said that you are a parent  so why not make npcs that are parents? Or children who get up to some mischief? Start from the mundane of everyday life and the fantastic can develop from there. Or it can just be a personal journal  and you can some sort of outlet. Which can get the old ideas out and you would just have to wait until the new ones get in.
1325,I know your struggles dude. I grow some serious attachment to my cars and it hurts like hell letting them go. All I can say is that when it is gone isn't it too bad and a week later is it like you never owned it. You'll still have fond memories and those should you cherish and just remember that you can always get another one when times are turning for the better again.  I personally am battling with this pre separation anxiety about selling one of my 3 cars right now. It is my first car and it is just standing on my driveway and I haven't driven it in like 2 years so it needs to go to an owner who can love and drive it but it is hard letting it go.
1326,I learned to and still do start in the slow group in the morning and move into faster groups later. It takes the stress of worrying about cars coming up behind you away.  It also feels great to move up knowing you're a skilled driver!   I once ended up in the fast group with GT3's and the like in my 1990 Miata! I would stay well out of the way on the big straights  but I could hang pretty nicely in the corners to some serious cars!
1327,I leave my rock chips on my front end  but I do repair the ones on actual metal panels because I don't want it to lead to rust. Luckily  my front end is aluminum and plastic so I don't need to worry about it.
1328,I like a lot of the designs mentioned.  I love my S550 GT. Don't see ever getting rid of it  I also like the wide body Charger. I think the Giulia is simple and drop dead sexy. Also the 458 IMO is one of the sexiest cars ever made.   But here's some thought - C7 Corvette  Granted  C8s are sexy. But IMO they resemble too many other cars and I don't see the resemblance of a Corvette in their styling.  The C7 is the last Corvette to look like a Corvette.
1329,I like how A-1 adapted [Eugene's death](https://i.imgur.com/51sLYfZ.jpg).  It was so abrupt  and the whole scene had no music playing in the background  to remind us that death comes anytime and its not *always* heroic. Its full of silence and dread. Once Shin shot him  only then the music started with *sad piano noises*. You can see that Eugene's death hit Shin *really* hard  even if his *expressions* aren't saying anything  [his eyes do](https://i.imgur.com/yUB128w.jpg).  Fido's return and Shin making that Vanagandr jump to hilarious results was two of the best moments in this episode for me!
1330,I like how they made it clear that Miss Baby Bird miss played and should have been more aggressive at points. It's small  but often these animes forget to highlight that sort of thing. Teruto being super edgy is comedic as hell  and I love the new char. Overall pretty fun ep  and I love how they are explaining things while they play.
1331,I like it. Depending on how it's done it increases stakes  gives the player some actual motivation  and can punctuate previously made story choices.  I don't particularly care about having a perfectly optimised party  so losing a character for a bit doesn't even negatively impact my experience.
1332,I like MB-Lab. It has better bodies shape and diversity. But no ready clothes.  I also tried DAZ - it's overall better. But most of the fancy stuff is behind the paywall (and they often don't even care to tell what is this asset exactly - a dress or a texture for some other (also paid) dress)  and use a trash e-mail account  they'll dump tons of spam on you from the moment you register and forever.
1333,I like monk / martial artist due to bare-handed.  I like Lancer because lance and spear are cool.  I like bow / gun because it's a safer option and I can hit & run.  I like casting magic  but I still haven't been able to find a game with good magic casting system. Most of the time the magic looks lame or lack mobility to be practical in real life.
1334,I like my fantasy closer to dark than light  with lots of (viable) options during character creation and character progression. I also like combat with options that does not get weighed down by lots of math or tables. I like skills.  As the GM I prefer systems where I can improvise everything from encounters to plots and I prefer playing in my own (often human centric) settings.  With that in mind  is Forbidden Lands a good fit?
1335,I like Odyssey  but for some reason... i'm a bigger fan of the Egyptian setting. I still play Origins to this day. I love being in that world and exploring it.    Not to mention the best looking water effects everrr (at least in the AC series) The newer games had good looking water too  but Origins is the peak for me.      Odyssey was super grindy too  it felt kind of like a bad MMO at times.
1336,I like pathfinder adventure paths for this exact reason.  I find the actual adventures to be wonky and hard to run  but they come with so many neat individual set pieces that give me good inspiration. Most of the time there is a bunch of extra stuff at the back of the book as well.
1337,I like that a distinctly queer-coded game makes a big splash in the scene. I personally got put off by an inclusivity rule at the start of the book  but I'll admit  the rest of it looks pretty cool and I hope it finds a home among its intended audience!
1338,I like the game  but it was frustrating. I feel like the starter area is a bit tedious and the first few battles in the Stolen Lands aren't particularly interesting. You have very little control of your characters and what they do.   Eventually  it DOES get interesting  culminating in the attack of the Stag Lord fort. The game made sense  and I liked it. Plus  I finally had my hands on some good loot (from the Stag Lord) and I wanted to try them out.  Then...lots of talking. Then more talking. Then I have to build a kingdom from scratch and if I get it wrong  my character is useless. It took me a long time to wrap my head around what makes a good character in the first place. That's the thing that bothered me - the feeling that I might have to do it all over again if I make a mistake in a system I've never seen before.
1339,I like the idea since battlemaps can often be kinda ugly  but I think how you have it right now shows too much of the front of the objects  which kind of makes it look like they're lying flat on the floor. I think it would work better if you used a perspective similar to video games like [Stardew Valley](https://encrypted-tbn0.gstatic.com/images?q=tbn:ANd9GcSWDDVT2DKL-xosr0JlQwXwXqfQ5wy_EUqreg&usqp=CAU) or Zelda a Link to the Past  where you can see the tops and fronts of objects.
1340,I like the way coupes look and like manual transmission but where I live it snows a lot. So RWD is out of the question. I know I could get winter tires for a RWD but I'm not at the point financially. I would like a manual AWD coupe but there aren't that many. So I would settle with a FWD coupe.
1341,I like to have videos and audiobooks on while I play games  but it's hard to listen when I'm playing a game that requires my full attention. Conversely  it's hard to play games that require focus while trying to listen to a podcast.  Any suggestions of games that don't require much focus to enjoy?
1342,I like to use Basic Roleplaying (the system at the base of Call of Cthulhu) for one-shots where the characters are normal people without powers or whatnot. There's a free quickstart on the Chaosium website. Characters are pretty easy to build and the rules are very intuitive.
1343,I like very few new cars in general anymore  but I think Honda nailed this one. Growing up I spent I a ton of time in 90s Japanese cars  they were very popular in my country. It reminds me a bit of those times. I'd love this hatchback with the 2.0 NA and a manual. I'm afraid it won't be available for very long in this form  demand is way higher for the CVT.
1344,I liked cars as a kid  but never felt like I love them until I got into college. It was car YouTubers (Gears and Gasoline  in particular) and 1/64 diecast models that made me love the hobby as a whole.
1345,i listened to a couple of audiobooks while playing that ubisoft breath of the wild clone...immortals i think. that was kind of nice for it. you can just spend ages just flying around gathering up stuff etc
1346,I lived there for six years when I was in the Air Force  as an American it was quite enjoyable. I think they should keep it the way it is currently. It works well  there are zones with no speed limit  generally when there is a straight or long curve  and not in the city or near a lot of exits. You can cut a good amount of time out of a trip. Set the cruise at 100-110 and watch the arrival time (and gas gauge) go down 
1347,I lived there from 2004-2007 and was fortunate enough to have a 500+ hp car.  My daily commute had a few unrestricted zones where I could really stretch it out  and traffic wasn't nearly as dense back then.  That along with regular Nuerburgring trips (back when it wasn't nearly as busy as now) makes me really think I experienced something special which may not exist soon.
1348,I love a long complicated game that really lets me live in a character. Time is the problem now. Sometimes it sucks having a kid. Playing the same game for so long can lead to not getting enough of a feeling of progression. And getting tired of the same thing. Usually playing two RPGs just gets me out of the feeling of playing one of them.  I usually have to push myself to finish a game like Pathfinder.  So  I appreciate short games like Outer Worlds. But  after finishing it the second time with the DLC(first time without)  I came away wondering if I'll play it again. I just wonder if it has enough meat.
1349,I love a RPG and grew up with D&D  balders gate  pool of radiance etc. My problem is that I can't play these types of games with the kids around. Just wondering if anyone can recommend a PS3 or PS4 game that I could play with the kids around? I'd be open to any genre. Our games are either G rated  ( for the kids) or M (15yrsplus) with unfortunately no in between. No PS5 as yet. Thanks in advance.
1350,I love either playing white or black mages. Whatever Fire can't solve  Cure can.  Unless we're talking about in MMORPGs  in which you do NOT want me playing your healer. My ADHD brain stops working. Too many damn variables.
1351,I love fast and agile characters with critical-like attacks  high evade  and large combos  usually with swords  knives or maybe some other kind of weapons like Chrono Cross' main weapon (can't remember the name). Whatever fits that criteria I choose it.
1352,I love Funcom's The Secret World setting - fantastic worldbuilding and writing. Just a shame it's mechanically awful after they rebooted it a few years back (who knows  maybe they have smoothed the rough edges by now?)
1353,I love how Kids on Bikes can have you ask each player to privately send you a rumor. You might discard some of them but when something shows up that a player pitched well they  have heard that rumor and get super excited.
1354,I love my Mazda 6.   But they def tried to sell it without saying it hadn't had an alignment. It felt like yours did.   I told them after the test drive to rotate the tires and alignment and I'd take it the next day.  Now it's perfect.
1355,"I love playing for something I cant really do in real life... like mages... but i usually like to mix magic and physical damage somehow...  But the best archetype is definitely blood mage from Dragon age. I mixed blood mage specialization with arcane warrior and I was totally badass mage in heavy armor utilizing blood magic and elemental magic...  From this day  eventhough I dont like being evil in games (and I have never played for evil chaaracter) but I like using ""evil"" specs and be good guy. I downloaded some mods to Skyrim so I could use blood magic even in Elder scrolls but it was mixed with vampire and it was also extremely cool experience but blood magic worked diffently in this mod.  And final fun fact. I hate blood IRL  so it probably nicely lives up to my wish: ""I love playing for something I cant really do in real life"" ..."
1356,I love playing with people from around the globe  but I limit my online play to +2 time zones.  (As I'm in EST  there is no -2 zones).  This works best.    I do allow friends in +3 to play  but that is always hard as the times get difficult for me.  I can't stay up until midnight on work nights.
1357,I love seeing some CRPG love from console players. Is great seeing the genre growing in popularity at least a little.  They might not be as flashy as JPRG or as accesible as WRPGS... But they are really rewarding.  Definitely try Divinity Original Sin if haven't and baldur gate 3 whenever arrives in consoles.
1358,"I love seeing the Reginleif finally animated in ""all"" its glory ( can't wait for the next episode to see the other goodies the thing has )   also  for fellow LN readers  is it just me or did they gloss over the heavy infantry? I remember then being mentioned before we saw the Reginleif"
1359,I love that older anime look  like the Akira look the way the art is done. I miss that  I hate the new anime look  it looks too computer animated with bleaked out colors. Either way would love to hear about some good anime from that period that has that vintage look.
1360,I love the **d66 dynamics** and i'm sort of **fascinated** by the d66 roll (i'm **obsessed** by the 6sided die).    Also  I play **my own RPG system  using just a d20 & 3d6 ** so it fits perfectly with my style.  Do you guys have **some free d66 tables** for encounters  loot  monsters  places etc?  Thank you \^\_\^ It would be usefull to have a collection of d66 tables to print out \^\_\^
1361,I love the character system and combat. But holy hell house at the end of time  and everything after that  was extremely tedious. So much so that I don't feel like replaying it any time soon  or even  once I've played through it the first time. Still a solid 100+ hours of entertainment though.
1362,I LOVE the Job system in Octopath Traveler and the way you can combine skills from jobs to create builds  and the class-specific gear and skills of Dragon Quest IX  all that jazz. Systems where you have to compose your builds and party in a way that works around their respective limitations are my jam. Any recommendations along the lines of these would be great!
1363,I love the lore and politics of Vampire: The Masquerade  but I'm super not interested in the sexual nature of the whole game  and also just not a big fan of how the 5th edition of that game is laid out in the book.   Does anyone have any recommendations that might scratch the same itch? I'm familiar with Urban Shadows and looking forward to the 2nd edition of that game. What else is out there?
1364,I loved DA:O  tolerated 2 enough to play a few time and only played 3 once. A big part of that was buying it for 360. The graphics were bad from the character creation screen onward. Poor textures and rendering made it an uncomfortable experience in spite of liking the story and characters.  It might be a good thing making it current gen only.
1365,I loved it at first  but by the end I never wanted to see it again. The last two chapters are such an insane slog and I never really cared about the antagonists. I don't have high hopes for Wrath of the Righteous. Does anyone know if the end chapters in that game are as soul-crushing as Kingmaker?
1366,I loved the first one  spent over 100 hours in it. I bought WotR day 1 but I'm waiting for the definitive edtion to play. It's a huge game and I'm not gonna play through it twice. but also wanted to support the dev
1367,I loved the side quests in particular. There weren't a ton of them  but they were mostly substantial and netted you some nice stuff. The Wolf Bouts were fun  finding the pieces of the Opera was a nice long-term goal  and collecting all of the Stud Cards for Cornelia's dresses was hilarious.  The series as a whole has some issues. Koudelka is paced extremely poorly and hasn't stood the test of time. The first Shadow Hearts and Covenant are great. From the New World has horrifically disappointing. Covenant was definitely the best of the series  and I'd confidently say one of the best RPGs on the PS2.  It also emulates beautifully and upscales amazingly well  for those with the means.
1368,I loved Witcher 3 and Kingdom Come Deliverance. I couldn't enjoy Skyrim though. It got boring for some reason and the whole reptile cat stuff put me off. I am writing here because the lists found on the web mostly included old games and indie games. I'd rather have HD stuff  as well as something that doesn't focus overly on combat nor on excessive fantasy elements.
1369,I made a quick proof of concept here: [https://sta.sh/01cd3s8c2tyx](https://sta.sh/01cd3s8c2tyx) (note this is just to get the idea across  in a real map I'd like to add a lot more details and more features  also make it cover a larger area because that's pretty small.)  But yeah  I'd just like to do something a bit more eyecatching than the standard top down maps. Would you use a map like this  and if so are there any problems you might foresee?  I know squares hidden behind objects like the angel statue might be confusing  and the only solution I can think of is overlaying a grid on top which I know isn't everyone's cup of tea. I'm also concerned with the scaling for games like dnd where a square is supposed to be 5 ft but in this style it's more like 2-3 ft. At my table I wouldn't personally be bothered by this disconnect but I could see it being irksome to some players that they can't throw a dagger at the guy on the other side of the long dining table.
1370,"I made it... boring when you ""just"" hit the switch  but now you get to the holdpoint switch. This adds a new mechanic with waves of enemies.  What do you think of it?  &#x200B;  [hold\_point](https://reddit.com/link/q82c2p/video/kr4jy71esft71/player)"
1371,"I mean  I didn't move ""away"" - I still play D&D. I just also play other stuff as well. Sometimes I feel like a fantasy A Team game and D&D comes out  and sometimes I feel like doing some magical girls so I bring out M&M  and sometimes I want to do something more chill but also weird so we pop out Chuubo  and so on.   The whole idea that the moment you play something else you'll realize how much D&D sucks and never want to play it again that is so common in this sub is honestly a bit weird to me  to be honest? I'm playing three separate online games at the moment (D&D 5E  L5R  and Chris Perrin's Mecha)  and honestly enjoying all three but I think the D&D one might be the most fun one?"
1372,"I mean  it's absolutely possible to GM a narrative PbtA game as if you were playing something like *D&D*  where the GM comes up with all the answers and the players put the absolute minimum effort required backstory in  but as you say  it requires the GM to have a lot more prep work done in the setting  and is usually a bit less interesting for them to play.  My first seasons of *Blades In The Dark* were extremely collaborative  but having made the decision to keep a persistent world between games  I don't need to ask so many questions for new groups  because all that prep work was done by other players in earlier campaigns.  Personally  though  the whole ""Game Master  entertain me"" attitude of players used to non-narrative systems is so off-putting to me that I just don't want to engage with these people.   EDIT: Removed some unnecessary bitterness towards our ferny brethren."
1373,I mean  Porsche  Lamborghini  Audi  Bentley  Bugatti are all subsidiaries of VW. And once youre dealing with or servicing those exotics  probably makes sense youd have other things like that on trade.
1374,i mean i hate apple but this looks like a bad precedent for capitalism. what's next ? cpu makers have to use the same socket ? car makers have to use only 3 wheel sizes ? all tv makers will use vestel boards ?
1375,i mean if the person who turned into the zombie was racist  then why wouldn't they say that  if it's necessary to put that in the game when it's not endorsed by quentin tarantino is a whole different conversation though
1376,I mean if you all keep buying it  youll never get a new game until profits start to shrink for Rockstar.  But then again  could rockstar be making the ultimate next gen-open sandbox game and funding it through remasters? Only time will tell
1377,I mean sure you can get away with using low quality gas. The car will still run if you use low quality oil too. The car will still drive on crappy tires and it will still stop with cheap brake pads.  That Genesis is not the same as an Elantra  premium cars use premium products for a good reason. If you're stressing about the basic cost of ownership for a higher end car then it probably isn't for you.
1378,I meanthey think the same think that appeals to suburban moms who know nothing about cars will appeal to enthusiasts. Yeah Im talking about the plastic body cladding.  I want to make fun of it on principle just so no manufacturers try to pull that shit again.   But yeah the blue looks better I guess just because Im more likely to accidentally look at something if its painted traffic cone orange.
1379,I moved away from 3.0 because it was painfully cumbersome after 10th level.  I came back for 5  but left it after a campaign because it's just a mechanically boring system. There's nothing wrong with 5 per se  there are just more engaging mechanics in other systems.
1380,"I moved away from being on the ""5e"" community to the ""rpg community"" and saw how much more other systems had to offer. In my mind  like so many other people  everything else was kind of like D&D  but that's not true at all! (even if many systems out there try to copy paste the mechanics for the sole reason of being popular). When I realized that I started to see some of D&D problems and the game felt kind of hollow and not suited at all to the kind of things I liked to do  it really felt like 30 minutes of fun packed in 4 hours of play. So  It has been years since I have DMed a 5e game and I'm very happy I got friends who don't want to force me to do it."
1381,"I moved away in the 3.5 days. Back then I was fed up with the constant math  having to reference a bazillion tables and sum up loads of modifiers for every single roll.  When I came back to gaming years later  I gave 5e a shot. No more non-stop inane math! ""Yay!"" I thought!... But I realized what I really hated about DnD was that it was all about combat  slow  boring combat  but only now it didn't have the tactical depth it had back in the 3.5 days anymore. I quickly gave it a hard pass and I'm not looking back."
1382,I moved from web development to making a game (as a hobby.)  Yeah it's tough but on the other hand  making a website look good on every fucking browser ever made is also TOUGH.  Stick with it  you'll get it.  Or don't stick with it.  Life is short  do what you want!
1383,I never played only D&D. D&D was not my first RPG. But there was time when I really liked D&D3 and played it more than any other game at that time.  Then I ran a long (over a year) campaign using it. And I ended up burned out completely with heavy prep  severe imbalance and the way the system actively got in the way of doing anything interesting with it (there was also a matter of diverging player expectations  but it's only partially the game's fault).   I couldn't bring myself to run a game for several months after that. I only returned to RPGs after I encountered Forge forums  read articles and games created there - this made me realize that RPGs can have clear focus and rules that really support it. I played Dogs in the Vineyard and fell in love.  Since then I learned and played many other games  but only touched D&D twice  for a short time. Once it was D&D4  which had much better focus and much better balance than 3e. We played some fun sessions  but gave up due to the game's unnecessary complexity and very poor digital tools. The second time was during early playtest of 5e. But D&D never became my main or even secondary game after the 3e disaster.
1384,"I never played the DLC for it because by that time my 360 got the red ring of death and i never bothered to get a new system.   So  my question is: did the DLC give the game a proper ending??  Because if i remember  the original game  it simply ended and i was like ""wtf? That's it?"" Nothing was resolved and I was left confused.  Now i can't even remember much of the game  it's been years."
1385,I noticed a prevalent sentiment in the gamedev world that it's not ideas that lead to success but execution.   Execution is obviously important  but if you try to execute the wrong idea  it more often than not will lead to disaster.  After struggling to get a game finished for years and  now being closer to finishing than ever before  it has dawned on me how choosing the right idea is paramount.  Get the genre wrong and you will have trouble selling. Get the scope wrong and you may go through hell and back trying to finish and never get there.  Wasted years  money and passion are the dangers of choosing the wrong idea.  Take your time and choose wisely.
1386,I on purpose bought an S2000 10 years ago  and proceeded to abuse the hell out of it on track.  That said  I had no idea exactly *how desirable* they would become  selling it when we were having kid #2 because I just didn't have time for track day bro stuff anymore.  Kicking myself for that now  if just for the fact I could have sold it now for probably double what I did then (spring 2018).
1387,I once planned to create a board game with them  but never got to it.  The basic idea was very similar to the Board Game Doom  where you delve through a space station and shoot aliens  picking up weapons along the way. Different aliens and different weapons use difference dice  you have to choose the right weapon for the right target.
1388,I one billion percent agree with this. Covenant is the best  but all of them are good. One is a bit archaic now a days but still amazing. Even to the new world is good just doesn't compare to the other two.
1389,I only know the basics of web development  still  I understand that it seems a bit easier to get an overview of web development  I mean once you understand the basics  e.g. HTML  CSS  and e.g. React (or just JS).  Game development recently got more complex for me when I switched from 10+ years of Indie & AAA game dev to learning more about engine & tools development.  There are so many layers of architecture and domain-specific knowledge I ignored for nearly two decades because I focused only on physics  player controls  animations  high-level networking  and AI.  Now I learn more about how to model and run graphs (DAG) that execute concurrent tasks  the basics of animation tools/pipelines & run-time (UX  animation specific state machines & blackboards  parallelized/optimized blend graphs  etc.)  and code generation to cover some non-trivial boilerplate code for programmers - just to name a few topics.  Depending on what you work on - new genres of games or engine/tooling - there's so much to learn in this wide field of game and engine/tool development  it is incredible and also amazing.  I just love it! :D
1390,"I own a 1995 Alfa Romeo GTV 916  2.0 litre Twin Spark. In my eyes it's the best looking 90s FWD coup  a segment that was booming back then  and it's one of the best looking cars from the 90s full stop. Right now I think prices for the I4 examples like mine are around 2000-3000  V6 ones a bit more but still under 5 grand. So it's quite worthless when it comes to its value. Though I have a feeling that their prices will creep up a bit in the coming years  as I've seen an increasing amount of articles titled among the lines of ""is this a future classic"" about the GTV.  About reliability  usability  et cetera  it's hard for me to say if it's worthless or not. My standards for these things are super low  probably because I've always been interested in Italian and French cars. Like yeah  parts are pretty expensive for what the car is  it fogs up like a motherfucker as soon as the clouds get a little darker  the trunk is barely large enough to fit the body of a 12 year old boy  and that only if you toss the spare wheel  the interior is small  it has electrical issues  you live in a constant fear of the timing belt snapping  and so on  and so on. I suppose many would call it worthless as a car  but personally I've even daily driven it just fine  you just gotta live with whatever the car is. Practicality is for nerds.  I am a firm believer that it is not the Italian cars that have soul  it is people who like them that just are crazy.  Edit: I realise many might not be familiar with the GTV 916  so [here's a fancy picture](https://imgur.com/a/aOYALAM) of a similar car to mine. Twin Spark  Phase 1  same small hole Speedline wheels and same colour. That blue is stunning live  by the way. One of the best blues the automotive world has seen  imo."
1391,I own a 76 280Z. With S30s steadily on the rise  I still daily drive mine as well as modify it. Theyre meant to be driven. If its worth more in the coming years  sweet  but that doesnt really mean much to me except paying for a better insurance policy.
1392,I own an older Acer Chromebook with a mediatek chip and it's been the worst piece of shit in laptop form that I've ever used.  It can't reliably playback 1080p video in chrome or in Android apps.  Updates have fixed it  then other updates break it.
1393,I own my country's only Centennial (1st generation Equus) and  afaik  1 of 2 V6 in Europe. The other 35 are V8. Also  mine is the only car *sold* new in Europe  the others have a different story.   The car was purchased to be driven. But I will not mod anything  even the tiniest changes would be wrong to my eyes. This car should be original. Unfortunately  my local Hyundai shop broke more than they fixed when I paid them for work  and didn't take responsibility for it. So I gave the car to a mechanic I know who is reliably decent in fixing stuff. It's just minor work  but due to some of his personal circumstances  the car has been at his garage for soon 7 months.  The sorry thing about this is we have salted roads during the winter. My entire driving season was forked by this. Super-meh.
1394,i paid 30k for my clean title but 58k mile b/w viper 3.5 years ago. Has some paint defects that you would expect for a car with those miles.  Some other small but easily fixable flaws. Mechanically its very sound.  I've replaced a wheel bearing  and since the boots were ripped  sway bar links and ball joints.  Any mods i have done or might do will be reversible as i'll keep the original parts.  Ive averaged a little under 2k miles a year on it.  Kind of crazy how much they've went up
1395,"I personally find I'm willing to put aside my favoured game ( it's Ad&d fwiw) to join a group that wants to play test  write homebrew  or use another system to tell a story.  I only partially agree ""system matters""  its more of how you play that game  than what the rules tell you to do. I mean rules are good for learning a game  but everyone tells their own story  and every RPG tells you as a DM to *do your own thing anyway* if they didn't people wouldn't buy their books would they?  I get some players find mechanics assist or distract from the narrative  but  trust me  if you don't need to consult the book for each and every detail  it helps more than a "" perfect system"".  Ymmv"
1396,I personally think the C3 is the most beautiful Corvette ever designed which I totally get is an unpopular opinion  but the C3 is basically gutless in stock form thanks to EPA mandates from the time. Its for sure the worst driving corvette despite it looking the best IMO.
1397,I personally think the MK7.5 Golf is peak Golf design  a design ethos that has stayed fairly consistent over 40+ years. I hate the direction they've gone with the MK8 but the MK7.5 has the best blend of hard edges and simplistic but nice curves compared to the earlier versions. It's unmistakably a Golf but a very clean (albeit somewhat muted) design. It's so neutral that it will naturally age well  it's largely free of gimmicky design trends of the day. the interior should also age well compared to most contemporary ones.   Honestly my wife's Tiguan probably won't look out of place 5-10 years from now either  it's a similar clean design that's really cleaned up in the top trim.
1398,I personally use Daz. Export the character to blender  make some details  add clothes and hair  make textures with Mixer and animate with cascadeur. That's my whole workflow and is working fine for me( for now I skipped the texture part since I am creating materials directlt in Unreal)
1399,I picked up an S2K CR around 2015.  Pretty sure it was at the bottom of the depreciation curve at that point. Since that point in time  Ive had no desire to sell the car and have thoroughly been enjoying it every mile  no new car can provide the feel and rawness this car provides in stock form at my buy price.
1400,I picked up my dream street-spec Gen V GTS before the pandemic and I still consider it be my greatest automotive and financial achievements at the same time. The car exceeded all expectations  and then proceeded to nearly double in value.
1401,I picked up the Press Start booklet at free rpg day on a whim  and I've gotta say  I can't wait for the English book.  I don't know if I'll be able to rope enough people into playing it  but I'm loving what I'm seeing enough to buy a copy for myself at least.
1402,I play with friends my age (a couple years younger than you) and have met a few more through them. I've been fishing around for new players but a lot of the local FB groups and Discords are all about 5e or similar  flashy RPGs  which really limits my options as I prefer more grounded stuff. I've actually considered doing OP or joining one of the Pathfinder groups just to snoop out more potential players  once in-person social stuff is a little safer and the holidays are over.
1403,I played a 2 player game of Ben Robbins' fractal timeline construction RPG Microscope today on r/distantsocializing. Thought I might share it to anyone interested.   &#x200B;  [https://www.reddit.com/rpan/q9paa1?ref=8539c74b-0a8f-4977-9bf0-56980ea0e943&utm\_source=share&utm\_medium=web2x&utm\_content=rpan\_stream](https://www.reddit.com/rpan/q9paa1?ref=8539c74b-0a8f-4977-9bf0-56980ea0e943&utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x&utm_content=rpan_stream)
1404,I played beta and launch yesterday    It is a lot of quests that rinse repeat    There's no vendor to sell items to. You either scrap it or put it on trading post (auction house)    Harvesting mats can be a grind as well. But you level the skill relatively fast and the zone buffs can make you harvest faster too.   So far it's been fun. Me and my buds chased a guy for 15 Mins last night just to get the kill .. then killed ourselves to for the free fast travel. Good times
1405,I played BG1&2 when I was around 12-13yrs old (and IWD before them). Didn't knew anything about DnD and hardly knew enough english. Had a little help from my friend during character creation but after that I managed to play through them without major hiccups and they are one of my most beloved games of all time.
1406,I played Fallout 1/2/NV extensivelly and never got borred  but then again I never played the game for the combat  for me progressing through the story is the rewarding part  and doing it in different ways every time if possible  most modern games have dropped this except for Fallout NV  a game that was not made by Bethesda btw  hence why it's so different from TES games. Also  as far as CRPGs goes  I have to say Gothic 1 is yhe only one that hooked me as much as Fallout  but it may be tedious at later stages also  but at least it's quite different in the beggining 2 episodes.
1407,I played it only on PSP and I wish I had a chance to play other games from the series but unfortunately it's exclusive on so many consoles and I won't buy a console just to play one game.  That said Birth By Sleep really charmed me and I wish I'll maybe get a chance to play other games.
1408,"I played most of the day yesterday.   - Crafting is an absolute blast.   - Quests are indeed a little ""kill 10 rats"" ish.  - It's grindy  but progression is fast. (Not QUITE a contradiction  but almost.) - Getting around is pretty slow. But I don't mind.  One of the things that's been a disaster for moderns is the fast-travel mount system that lets you damn near teleport anyplace.  Takes all the sense of scale out of it immediately.  So this is a nice change.  It's early. But I'm really digging it."
1409,I played on ps4 and ps5. Game crashed and deleted my saves both times ~60 hours in. Not to mention all the other bugs. No don't waste your money. Get divinty 1 or 2  pillars of eternity 1 then 2  or the diablo 2 remaster
1410,I played the game on a PS4 Pro and the slowdown was horrendous further into the game and there were savegame bugs and other issues. Not an Xbox I know... But I know Xbox One had major issues as well when the game released  not sure if fixed...If you had a Series S/X might be better w/ extra horsepower but last gen consoles probably not good for this game.
1411,I played them for the first time 2 years ago. I played them on story mode so it was pretty easy. There were some difficult areas  but that's mostly because some enemies can insta kill you.  I played them for the story. The first is great at times. Especially towards the end. Before that there are 15-20 hours of meh. It was a great game to play while listening to a podcast or watching YouTube. BG2 was great from start to finish. Plenty of fun quests. The highs were closer and the lows were further apart.
1412,I played through it on Normal. Apart from needing a *little* bit of grind  it's not that bad. You'd definitely need a walkthrough for some areas  though most the really obtuse parts are optional content.
1413,I played with a guy like that in the early 90s. Every time he walked into the game store he'd walk out with a new worldbook for some new system to play. It was cool to see the variety  but sometimes I wanted to play a system for a while  especially when it was a good one with a lot of flavour.
1414,I played Yuito's story first and the only problem is you get a whole bunch of exposition towards the endgame that explains Kasane's side of things briefly. I would say the game was designsed to play first one and then the other. Gameplay wise you will steamroll everything because new game+ and enemies do not get harder.
1415,"I posted this before in another thread on this sub.  I'd also add that I find the skill system incredibly boring.  I feel like 5e hit sort of the worst of all worlds. It's not simple enough to really be considered ultra beginner friendly and easy to pick up (Shadow of the Demon Lord does this way better  IMO)  but it's not complex enough to satisfy old-school ttRPG players (unlike  say  Pathfinder 1e or 2e).  Having moved onto other systems  there are aspects of them that you just sort of smack your head and say ""this is genius  why didn't 5e do this!?""  -The ancestry/heritage system of PF2e is light-years better than 5e's race system.  -The Boons/Banes system of Shadow of the Demon Lord feels like what advantage/disadvantage should have been.  -Combat feels really dull. There's very little movement  it's mostly ""get into combat  beat down enemy  repeat"". This is exacerbated because enemies often feel like bags of HP.  -The feat system of PF2e just feels so much more developed than 5e's subclass system. Part of the big issue with 5e is that  except for choosing spells and whether or not you multiclass  once you pick your archetype your character creation feels pretty ""on the rails"" the rest of the way.  As for Hasbro/WotC  I'm not a huge fan of them  and I'll leave it at that."
1416,"I posted this in the mazda subreddit but I wanted to see if I could get more responses here. The car drives fine for the most part  until I get up to around 60 mph  at which point the car will sometimes quickly jerk to the left or right  often several times in a row like it's being pushed by the wind. It's not like a ""fly off the road"" kind of jerk but it's definitely noticeable and a little unnerving at times. Seems to happen only on certain parts of the highway  so I'm guessing the road has something to do with it. It's a manual transmission  70k miles  only owned it for a month. Mechanic did a PPI before I bought it and everything checked out according to him. Someone in the Mazda sub suggested the shocks might need to be replaced. He recommended pushing down on the front and back of the car to see if it feels bouncy. I did this and the car didn't seem bouncy. Someone else recommended checking the tire pressure  which I will do this afternoon. Just curious to see if you guys have any other suggestions or possible problems that you would like to add. I should add that the tires are brand new  16 inches.  Edit: thank you for the responses. I'll start with tire rotation and alignment"
1417,I prefer not to have them but they dont really bother me either. I keep my cars clean inside and out  all the time  but theyre meant to be driven  chips are going to happen. If Im behind a gravel truck flinging rocks all over the freeway  Ill get upset about it  especially if person in front of me paces that truck instead of passing it so we can get out the blast zone  but normal driving  eh  its life. Its amazing how many people slow down and stay in the blast zone when it happens. WTF is your thought process here?
1418,I prefer settings which are original  since in my experience you can just take an existing system that isn't too tied to it's own setting and hack it to work with the setting of the fictional property. Gimmie new stuff!
1419,"I preferred going melee in Origins (Dwarfs are amazing). I finished the game a few times with different builds  but my favourite was a two-handed melee weapon. Archery isn't really too good in the first game. You'll want to have one or two mages (Wynne for healing) and a rogue for locks is nice too (not a must have though if I'm not mistaken)  In the second game you'll definitely want to be a mage. Mages play a big part of the story and that game needs all the possible aid it can get to keep people interested up until the end of the game. I'd also line to remind that you can't get the female pirate in the second act  so get her in the first act. She was one of my favourite characters after the first companion.  In the third game I'd like to recommend an archer. Archery was a lot of fun in the third game  whereas melee combat felt like a chore to me. Mage would be another possible choice  but I liked the freedom of movement archers have over mages. Also  don't stay in the first area too long. Continue with the story as soon as you can or you'll die of boredom. The story really begins after you leave the first area and the game gets a lot more interesting. And you'll be able to come bact to each location later if you so desire.  Like mentioned earlier  mages play a big part of the story and lore of the games  so they are a safe bet. I won't name the other ""important"" character role as playing as them requires you to know more than I wish to spoil and it won't really add too much to the experience (if at all)."
1420,I purchased a refurbished hp elitedesk 800 g3 that has all display ports. I would like to swap the option port for a VGA port but I'm having a difficult time finding compatible cards. There are tons of g4 compatible card for Flex io and Flex io v2. But none have listed the 800 g3 as compatible. So where do I find these cards?   The product pdf from the hp website listed options cards for this model.   https://support.hp.com/us-en/document/c05371240#AbT12  So surely they exist somewhere?   Thanks.
1421,I raced sports cars for 13 years and I've bought hundreds of sets of tires. I JUST put Michelin Cross Climate 2s on my street car and they're the best all season tires I've EVER had. Go to the most reputable tire store and have them balanced  I'd bet $100.00 they're way out and that there's a worn out suspension bushing or ball joint AND that guy couldn't align it well. Pure bullshit.
1422,I ran 5e. Ultimately  the game became work to run it. I was working too hard to account for all the little fiddly bits of a game that was as unbalanced as a sailboat on its side while it kept yelling in my ear that I just didnt know which way was up.  Dnd is the only game Ive come across that has the RAW vs RAI discussion  which proves just how poorly written the game is. It uses this legal type lingo that can be interpreted a bunch of different ways with no direction on how to interpret them beyond rule of cool.   The game fails to make any firm decisions on anything in an effort to please everyone. Is alignment important? It must be  because some magic items rely on it and every creature gets one  but theres nothing to do with it except use it as an excuse when a player is being an asshole.  The game gets in its own way so much because it has so many little rules for things  and no rules for some really important things.   The 5th edition of the game is built off material that honestly works better for what its supposed to do: be a dungeon crawler. Now its trying to be everything but and they keep mashing disparate systems and rules together so that you need 2-3 of their $50 books to even play the damn thing.  The devs of the game dont care about making a game  they care about making money. If you think otherwise  then look at the financial investment it takes to start any other game on the same level as dnd where youll find a cost differential of about $100  $70 if youre going big.  Tl;dr: the game aint good.
1423,"I read all of these comments and I have a very strong opinion. Please please please stop beating yourself up. You're learning something new  and I don't know about you but I've found that fixing mistakes and making them in the first place is how we learn as programmers and people in general.   How you feel right now is how it felt when you first started with code  before you knew what basic syntax even was. But do you remember way back when  when a little *click* happened in your brain? And suddenly two pieces of something smashing around in your brain collided together and eureka  you developed your ability. And just like you're learning to develop a game  it's important to learn to develop yourself too! You must allow time and space  the right circumstances  for things to fall into place. You WILL get it  when you're just doing it without thinking  on intuition and instinct in a state of flow. It's magical and I'm sure you know the feeling.  These being said  my advice: 1. Unity and C# definitely have a lot of territory to cover. This makes it so you're trying to understand the scenery in front of you but with a very long tube attached to your eye  giving you a field of view of 1.0. It's hard to really hone your focus in on the right things for progress. 2. Try not to engine hop all over the place. Pick one  maybe two. Like Godot for 2d since it is absolutely brilliant for beginners to just get something completed. And unity for 3d  larger projects because it has more history  support  and documentation.  3. Finish something  seriously  I want to see Hello World displayed on the game screen. Then make pong with random enemy movements  don't over complicate! Just finish it. Done? Excellent! Now you can try to tackle the AI  but this time  you're opening a completed  working project you know and understand  and your focus is on that one aspect. Rinse and repeat! Otherwise you're just juggling a thousand things to focus on and that's not fun nor productive 4. Godot. Seriously check it out. It uses GDScript  which is based on the syntax and style of python! I've found it massively reduces the scope of focus by it's inherent simplification. Don't forget python is one of the best beginner languages to learn.  5. Prototypes. Create a new project and don't call it ""Timerland Fantasy "" nor any title. Call it ""Timberland Prototype 1"" or something test. Detach the idea that this project is going to be a production ready wunderkind. It's a learning project. So make (try)  learn  move on. Remember  it's hardest to advance in an RPG when you spread every stat point you get on everything. You're not going to beat someone who's got a sword and out their points in strength  defense  and endurance. When you have 5 points in intelligence  magic  dex  strength  trapping  etc.   One day  not today  maybe not tomorrow  but some day it will happen.  You will open a new project  with your ideation in mind  and it just flows. Things work to the point where you surprise"
1424,I realized that 5e didn't encourage gameplay that my group wanted to push for  that it actively hindered one player's fun and that it was so. much. work. to GM it. I could go more into details but that's the gist of it really.
1425,I really dislike this in games where you get more party members than you can use at once. Naturally you'll select the ones you like and ignore the rest. Otherwise  you're trying to juggle too many characters. But then you either lose a character you were using  making you stuck with someone who is underleveled. Or at some point in the game  you're forced to use all of your characters and half your team is useless  This is something that I really dislike in jrpgs as I feel this happens most often in them.
1426,"I really don't care for Doug's elitist tone about how cars that are below him to drive are just ""cheap and pathetic""   He did the same thing with the Mitsubishi Mirage. There's nothing inherently wrong with a car just because it is cheap."
1427,i really don't see why anyone would have an issue with this (besides not being able to price gouge on cables). having a billion different standards sucks. at least the computer industry has mostly standardized cables and such. except the fing front panel header. would be nice if a device purchased in 2021 didn't come with micro USB anymore
1428,I really enjoyed the Outer Worlds. I also just started up Assassin's Creed Valhalla. I didn't love the old Assassin's Creeds that much but I also haven't played one of them in 8 or 10 years. I like this one so far  about 8 hours in. Also all the Far Crys are great. 4 is my fav but 3 and 5 are good too. Far Cry 6 looks great and comes out in a week.
1429,I really have been thinking about trading the ZR2 in for a maverick. If they make a hybrid awd version  I am almost going to guarantee I will. The gas alone will save me money. The ZR2 gets 16mpg. I love it but it really is overkill for what I need.
1430,"I really like how Savage Worlds comes up with the idea of the ""travel montage.""  You deal out a card at random  to each player  and they have the option of telling a little detail about their character  or something interesting they come across in their travels (determined by the suit of the card).  They can refuse  but if they do play along  they get a small reward.    Those little details are something that many GMs can latch onto and  use as hooks for events later in the story!"
1431,I really like it. I want to buy one  but Im expecting to be let down by the top trim being auto only or something equally disappointing.   Ford in Australia have an incredible talent for fucking up every car that isnt a Ranger.
1432,"I really like long term games  with plenty of neat hooks I can bring up again in the future. My trouble is  I also like new things... Which is a problem when a campaign lasts a year or more  especially since I tend to plan out a full campaign every 3-4 months.  So  here's my advice. First  do some one shots. It keeps things fresh  and it lets you try a system without dedicating too much time to it. Second  try your hand at writing a campaign - doesn't have to be too complex  maybe as simple as having a big boss that reports to an even bigger boss  or a ""you were working for the bad guy the whole time"" twist  or something else equally tropey. Throw in some quest givers and away you go. For the most part  your players will provide direction  but every couple weeks or so  sit down and figure out what pops up next  and build in some events or situations that add in some mystery  like a political coup  or some sudden assassinations  whatever. Basically  keep it interesting  and tailor the larger world to react to your players  rather than remaining static.  I've found that iterating over my campaign notes keeps me invested in the campaign at hand  and additionally helps keep the campaign interesting - fewer plot holes  more juicy hooks  and more plot molded by the players instead of something more bland and linear. And  me more invested in my campaign means less attempts to switch  so better for everyone all around."
1433,I really like the ease that the keyboard comes off with and the integrated dongles  as well as the manual mic/camera cut offs.   I really wish the battery was on the bottom and preferably in the back - right now it's limited to one battery size  would be really nice to be able to swap it out with a chonker if desired.  Ram would probably be better off sodered on to take advantage of the smaller form factors of integrated ram  not to mention the motherboard would cap out your options anyway.
1434,I really like the exterior compared to the old one. It looks...German? And the interior is gorgeous  there is a lot of bang for buck for the price in this car. It looks like Honda knocked it out of the park with this one.
1435,"I really like the rogue archetype or the fighter. Highly versatile and can do practically anything. I'm not one for magic in games. Besides D&D I find magic to all feel very samey. ""Oh cool  a magic blast  what else can they do"" ""Well  they can do that magical blast in 3 different flavors!!!"""
1436,"I really love the (modified) travel add-on rules that I use in Torchbearer.  Torchbearer makes any interesting  *complicated* interaction a thing called a ""conflict.""  Essentially whatever the conflict is with is treated as an enemy with hitpoints and attacks and actions.    The add on rules I'm using from Mordite Press treats your journey as an enemy with hitpoints equal to the distance you're travelling.  There's a bunch of random encounter tables that are tied to the type of terrain being travelled and that change up the journey's attacks and special abilities.  Any three turn round that the players are able to reduce the journey's hitpoints means that they get past that entry on the random encounter table and move on to the next.  Torchbearer also has an interesting trick it plays with maps and locations.  Players keep a running list of places where they have been and can spend actions while camping to try and mark them as being ""mapped.""  As long as the GM decides that there are no new dangers for them to stumble on between two mapped locations  players are able to effectively ""fast travel"" between them without having to worry about making any rolls or expending any resources."
1437,I really wanted an S2000 around 2014-2015  thats when they were cheap as fuck  Im talking 8-9k for a nice example.   Come 2018 I was able to pick up an AP1 for 5k  all because of a blown motor  and certain parts being riced. I love the car now  and I wouldnt sell it for anything less than 35k.
1438,I really wanted one. My local dealer had one delivered last week and I went to see it that morning. They tried adding a $5k dealer markup over sticker  pushing the price to over 31k. That's not the point of this truck (at least not the XL that I wanted). They wouldn't budge on price.   F Ford and their dealers.
1439,I really wish they would revive Enemy Territory: Quake Wars.  It truly was the Makron's favorite stroggifier.  I got so incredibly into that game after getting it for free with my 8800 GTS.  It was in that sweet spot right before every online shooter had to have progression mechanics and upgrades and cards and loadouts and customization and achievements... and hats.  A revival would actually terrify me because of those modern features.  Everyone was playing because  at least to us  it was fun and competitive and compelling on its own.  There was some stat tracking  but it didn't affect gameplay.    I will never forget the satisfaction of charging into a room with my team and mowing everyone down with a hyperblaster while my team got to work ;\^;7
1440,I recently beat ** Tales of Arise ** after around 42 hours or so. Overall liked most of the characters and thought the story was pretty solid. My major gripes with the game are that the enemies are major sponges / too tanky and the last dungeon I found to be incredibly boring to go through. For me I would say a solid 8.   I am still working my way through the post game of ** Labyrinth of Galleria ** in Japanese. I need to grind more spoons  so my motivation is a bit low at the moment but I plan to beat it before the year ends.   Started ** Lost Judgment **. Similar to the first game  I really enjoy the VR dice game and spend wayyyyy too much time on side quests / random games / claw machines. Side quests make me happy though and are 100 % less fetchy than those in Arise.   Debating if I should import ** Monyuu** or wait for localization news. Reviews seem mixed but I want more dungeon crawlers. Thankfully Undernaughts is coming out soon  so will start playing that soon!
1441,"I recently bought an Acura in June. Haven't had to drive it much due to 1. crazy high gas prices 2. I now work an at home job.  Tried to start my car today and the battery was dead  my family tried to jump it and it still wouldn't charge.  I called the dealership and they said I need to have it towed in to be assessed. I asked if it could be covered under warranty  and they said it would have to be determined due to their ""tests"" on if anything was improperly charged etc. I was like wtf. Does this make any sense lol."
1442,I recently finished my canon play through of the mass effect remaster and have already started a new character. However I also want to play something new so Im trying Dragon Age: Origins which Ive never played before. Any advice for a first time player as to race/class/any other pertinent info? All help is appreciated!
1443,"I recently formatted and reinstalled windows in my computer. Ever since  my audio doesn't work. When I plug in my headphones  they don't show up in playback devices. I have ""show disabled devices"" enables but they still don't show. I've tried reinstalling Realtek drivers  unplugging and plugging the device again but they don't show up no matter what. I've also tried enabling stereo mix but that doesn'g help. Sometimes  the headphones randomly show up and start working  but then whenever i restart my computer  it stops showing again.  Any help is HIGHLY appreciated as I've been frustrated over this for a long time"
1444,I recently got the bug to start collecting RPGs that appeal to me and i have a small list that is growing.  My dilemma is that i dont want to splurge but i also dont want the rpg to go out of stock.  Mork Borg and Feretory were on my list and just recently Feretory was out of stock on Amazon.  I luckily found it on Wal Mart and then just bought it.  So whats generally the timeline from release to totally out of stock for kickstarter RPGs?
1445,I recently had my catalytic converter stolen/die on me (I didnt give myself a chance to look  drove it straight to a muffler shop) and my car went from a normal street car sound to a loud hot rod.  I was told they could replace it  or put a straight pipe on it since my state doesnt require emissions test.  I know almost nothing about cars  but I was told that the straight pipe is much cheaper  though I dont know if the noise level will be what it originally was with a straight pipe. With that being the case  should I replace the cat and eat the cost?
1446,I recently had this problem happen to my Lenovo Yoga  killing my SSD for the second time. (First time being a weird combination of closing the laptop lid  reopening  and pressing the power button.) Shit was scalding hot.  Though  I had some luck by baking the SSD in my oven and was able to reuse it without the data.
1447,I recently played an rpg game on Roblox (don't bully me for that) and I had to kill enemies and bosses to get loot in different dungeons I want an rpg game where I kill enemies and bosses to get better and better loot and its open world if there is one with levels or dungeons I'm fine with that too
1448,I recently started the first game-just played the tutorial for now. What difficulty should I play on? Maybe the classic? Seems like I'll need to look up a build as sometimes you can build your character in a way that means you can't win.  Any opinions?
1449,I recently was in a minor crash and had to use an unfamiliar mechanic to get my car fixed. I suspect that I was overcharged and the shock absorber that he claimed to have changed wasnt actually. Is it possible for me to check if the shock absorber was changed or not?  Maybe the absorber has a number on it that I could match to the car.
1450,I recently went on a small splurge for RPGs and here's what I got.   Pathfinder: Kingmaker/Pathfinder: Wrath of the Righteous  Planescapes: Torment and Torment: Tides of Numeria  Baldur's Gate 1/2/3  Dragon Age (highly recommended) and its' two sequels.   Mass Effect and its' sequels.   Jade Empire  Fable  Neverwinter Nights and Neverwinter Nights 2  Shadowrun Returns  Dragonfall  and Hong Kong.   Pillars of Eternity 1/2 and Divinity 1/2.   Diablo 1-3  Dragon's Dogma  All of it pretty rewarding and what have you.  Some you listed  but just putting it all out there.
1451,I recommend AC: Origins instead. It has a better story and is more fast-paced while AC: Odyssey is just a slog. I liked the first hours but then it got really repetitive quickly. The landscapes arent as diverse at it seems at first glance  too. So I would rather recommend you to buy AC: Origins. It is also a rpg  has nice landscapes and a good story.   (If you cant decide which one to get: AC: Origins and Odyssey are sometimes on sale as a cheap bundle. If you play on PS4 there is also a bundled physical edition with both games available.)
1452,"I recommend Friends at the Table! So many of their most interesting plots come out of trying to solve a solution creatively. Just recently  one of their most recent adventures ended with a long conversation between players about how to properly eliminate a vast evil that was threatening the local area  and none of the solutions were just ""hit it until it's dead."" They do a good job of using the systems that they're playing each season to the best of their ability"
1453,I recommend The Troubleshooters from Helmgast. It is based on Franco-Belgian comics like Tintin  Spirou  Yoko Tsuno  mixed with some Lupin III and similar stuff.  The setting is a fictitious 1965.  One good thing  is that it is difficult to die. You are normally just knocked out  unless you specifically choose to up the risk to first be wecone wounded  and then again to be in mortal peril. It is also a game where getting captured is a good thing  as that gives you more story points  which can be used to activate certain abilities  or  change your die rolls.  The game had its Official release here in Europe yesterday (14th of October). The US release will be in Q1 2022. It will be distributed by Modiphius so should be easily available in game stores. You can order it through the Europe an sellers in the meantine  though that will probably be rather expensive.  You can download a free Quickstart version from Helmgast.se . There you also have a Quickstart scenario that I wrote and the games creator edited. More such adventures are on the way (they are waiting for art and layout). The games creator also put up a quick demo-scenario.
1454,I regularly play Pathfinder 1e online  I also DM it. I hate Kingmaker and Wrath Of the Righteous so much. I know a lot of people like them but coming from Pathfinder 1e proper to how these games interpret the system is so jarring.
1455,I remember a time when Kingdom Hearts was my favorite game of all time as well  nowadays I still quite like it  but I don't really care for it anymore  if that makes sense.  I always have a lot of fun playing any of the games  but the story is just so convoluted  and the writers just go adding characters and more characters and it's just ridiculous how they expect you to feel attached to them just because they're there.   Example: I've always thought that Roxas was an interesting and tragic character  I am one the few people that didn't mind the slow beginning of KH2 because I liked Roxas conflict. So I got 358/2 days just for that reason  and I was sadly presented with Xion  Roxas doesn't even have an inner conflict in this game  he is just going after Xion (whose existence is really stupid)  and she is having all the inner conflict that I was expecting from Roxas  and almost all of it is conveniently offscreen  while Roxas just mopes. The most interesting part of this game is it's last 5 minutes where Roxas decides to stop moping and do something  just to be captured and put on that simulation by Riku and DiZ. And then  he and Xion are revived for some reason at KH3? Which defeats their whole conflict?   Which is another beef of mine: Kingdom Hearts writers can't keep anyone dead. When I discovered that Sora will most probably revive in the next game  I just gave up. The best way to enjoy Kingdom Hearts is to skip all it's cutscenes and just enjoy it's combat and ignore everything else  but that kinda don't make me involved in the series  so I don't really look forward to KH4  I will most likely play it after a while  but definitely not invested in the franchise anymore to play it at launch.
1456,I remember being so excited for each one coming out that I would mark down the release and take the day off from school/work.  After FF12 13 14 I just dont care about the series anymore.  This one might change my mind  and I hope it does. I really miss the feeling and magic playing FF as a kid.
1457,I remember being strapped for cash  and buying a copy of GTA V nd needing to get an external harddrive to install the game on my 360.   Good times  but also years ago. Ive switched jobs twice now  bought a house  got married and  have two kids now. Yet people are still buying the same damn game.
1458,"I remember in the lead up to Diablo III's release  I saw an interview with the creative director (or maybe it was an EP) and the gist of the quote went something like  ""we looked at what made the first two frames so great  and did our best to replicate that. At the end of the day  Diablo games are *all about one thing: loot.*""  And that's when I knew Diablo III was not going to be my kind of RPG."
1459,I remember Intel trying this ten years ago  but for low-end consumer CPUs. It didn't stay around for long.  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intel_Upgrade_Service  I wonder targeting the server market  where customers are already used to paying these types of licences fees on network equipment and appliance boxes  will work out better for them.
1460,I remember people liking the g35 a lot in the US. Both it and the Z car were very popular (in the states mind you  not as the skyline in japan.)  Id still happily rock a g35 sedan with a stick. I think thatd be a lot of fun and faster than the contemporary e46.
1461,I remember when GTA V came out  I was in college. Now Im almost 30 and see people play it on PS5. They need to either update the game to next gen and incorporate all the other maps into provinces or release a new game entirely. Stop milking this franchise because your hindering its creative growth. I remember it was always a game changer when GTA hit the market  now its just a money milking machine for Take Two.
1462,"I remember when the original Two Worlds said it was ""Oblivion on Steroids"".  It's even printed on the box  I got a physical copy of it not long after it came out.  So seeing how bad Two Worlds was even though Two Worlds 2 was worse  I'll take this with a grain of salt.  I'm not saying this is going to be bad like Two Worlds was since Obsidian is a part of it  I'm just saying don't go getting too hyped up and Pre-Order it and then it end up being a horrible game.  I just have trust issues when companies say it's ""Oblivion or Skyrim on Steroids"". Let the game speak for itself and don't compare it to anything."
1463,I respect that everyone owns cars for different reasons  sounds like youre not sure what yours is yet? I bought my Lotus to drive  and for the most part I have driven it every chance I get. I also made some modest mods to it  to make it what I wanted to see - diffuser  exhaust and different tail lights.   And the kid part is priceless. My kids have helped me work on all of my cars  but they love the Lotus and they know Im handing it down to them one day too. Working on it created a love of cars that seems increasingly rare these days no regrets.
1464,I roll in front of everyone.  However  I wish to share one time (cough...decades ago) I had the same feeling. One player had a sting of high rolls (straight 3d6) that I did not see in the course of player creation (group session zero). I had left the room for some reason (bathroom perhaps).at least a couple of 18s and all high teens. When I came back I said seriously? The entire group said yes  they where excited and cheering for the player who rolled it  like a Craps game.  Years (cough decades) later  my friend said...remember when Jim rolled up that character for Keep of the Borderlands?  I did remember  because I had thought he cheated if it was not for the whole table witnessing.  I have seen some crazy long chains of odds defining rolls at the craps table in Vegas (I know because it cost me)  I have also been delt Pocket Rockets three times in a row in a poker room  seen someone place $10k on a single number and let it ride ride and it hit twice. Those are all seriously against the odds. I tend to pause before slapping leather these days when the situation occurs  but there are those moments you just know and those you don't.
1465,I run a regular campaign with my group  my players are comfortable with the system we use and it seems to allow them more freedom to roleplay without having to remember new rules.       When we hit a good cliffhanger  or chapter end  we take a break and run a short arc with another system.  Sometimes I'll rotate in one of my players to run an adventure for us.  Then we go back to the tried-and-true again.  It's the best of both worlds.  I get to run different stuff  and they can have fun with it knowing the world and characters they built and cherish are waiting for them.
1466,I said this in one of the previous threads a few weeks back but people weren't happy to hear it.  It's going to go back up  not only because Crypto is back up but also because we are entering into winter  which means people will be locked inside again and there will be more demand for gaming and if you casually mine winter is the best time to upgrade a new GPU and mine it for 4 months and let it heat your home. Plus Christmas/holidays where kids and people are looking to get a new shiny toy. Also TSMC price hikes  and shortages due to shipping and component demand due to the holiday rush  remember Windows 11 is launching  and if it's like every other Windows launch  there is a huge push by manufacturers to sell prebuilts and laptops  and that will cut into DIY availability.
1467,I saw that eugene died in the wiki but I didn't think he would die in episode 3 fuck sake COPIUM  the ED song is kinda ear screeching and I somehow cant stand it  bring back avid and hands up to the sky pls ;c
1468,I second everyone else recommending therapy  or at least seeking help. I had a similar problem (not quite tot his extent)  but what helped me was taking a break from TTRPGs and doing *other* things with my friends (even when we restarted the campaign).
1469,I see people are jealous cuz they couldn't handle Shin drippin with all that Chadness..  So many things are back.. Shin and team is back on the front line  Fido is back and the Gun is back too..  That mascot role description makes me uneasy  but now it looks better.. especially when Frederica is with them..  Once again Welcome back Shin.. back to the Death Field to send the fallen back to the soil..  With such carelessness in the battlefield at the beginning  the ending shouldn't have come as a surprise.. but that lil girl  I wonder what happens to her now..
1470,I semi-similarly have a note on my phone keeping single-sentence bits that could put together a setting. However  a) I am very eclectic of that (so pausing to bote it down is rather rare) and I don't have to go down the rabbit hole of actually making it happen on the spot - I just keep the highlight with the intent of one day  maybe  stitching everything together.  I couldn't know  but perhaps I've dodged the rabbit hole you're in.
1471,I set up a second gaming night  just to try out new systems. And then I run a regular on a different night. Mostly the same group  but a couple players weren't interested in learning new systems  so we found people that were.  Even then...I'm running Knave next Tuesday and wondering if I could swap in Cairn instead. So it doesn't really help that much. Just chasing the dopamine of new stuff.
1472,I sold my e30 5 years ago to help me with a down payment to buy a house. It pained me  but afterall  it's just a car. Sell this one  and promise yourself to buy another one when you can justify it. There's lots of them out there!
1473,I sometimes can't stop thinking about unsolved issues or am still too much focused on a thought/idea.  My partner noticed recently that antihistamines help a lot to sleep well for 8+ hours. More a coincidence to learn that since the main purpose of this family of legal drugs is to treat allergies.  What distracts me and also makes me tired enough to sleep on nights where I'm overstimulated is reading something rather complicated and understanding it - like learning a new topic related to math/physics or programming. Usually at 9/10 pm I can keep that up for max. 90mins until I get sleepy.
1474,"I started by doing some of the tutorials provided by unity. Like ""Roll a Ball"".    Then I guess just make a simple game. The important questions will arise from that and you then just have to google the solution.    Good luck!"
1475,I started Game dev relatively recently  around 2 years ago  and let me tell you  I was about to give up maybe 10 times a week during the first few months.   Now  2 years later  Im making games  Youtube Tutorials  and even Courses!  With enough willpower  you can achieve anything :)
1476,I started GMing so I could try games that arent 5e. Thats basically it.   I have a love/hate relationship with GMing in that I get stressed to the max  I worry that nothings good enough  and I start thinking that no one is having fun and Im just kind of holding people hostage. But every once in a while I forget about all of this and I just Play. And then I love it. So every time I run a game first I need to go through a process of convincing myself that it will be ok and I can do this. I wonder if this will ever go away.
1477,I started learning web dev to have a job then go onto gamedev. I'm starting to see how just a single coma can make a difference to the output. In gamedev i'm so curious how you deal with the unpredictability of the user and the code itself. There is so much to take into consideration  a npc script encountering a different npc script  how they'll react to physics  terrain etc... How do you even know where to begin when debugging ? How does it work with so much elements ?
1478,I started my computer journey with an FX Vision CPU in an HP Omen  and I remember it was awful  it did what I wanted it to do but not much else. It played TF2 and it didn't play too much else. AMD has come a very long way from being che cheap option or the one with the most cores for the cheapest. It just shows the rise to dominance that AMD has taken
1479,I started off with 2e D&D and played through 3.5 but didnt like how complicated it was becoming. Just started to feel too much like warhammer with all the boosts from unit composition. Players started to build their characters around strategy and that ruined it for me.  Found Basic fantasy RPG a few years back and haven't played any other rpgs since. I love the simple feel and old school nostalgia
1480,I started out playing blobber RPGs as a kid (this was pre-Baldurs Gate)  got into shooters as a teen  and over my university time transitioned back to RPGs again. Added some other stuff like 4X  but mainly still play RPGs. And yeah  also usually one game I play for ages. 35 now.
1481,i started playing something like this yesterday. it's called <wizardry 8>. the graphics are fabulous :)  >loot that actually makes you feel like you are intimidating in that world not just the same Robes/Armor and Weapons  i don't understand. example?
1482,I started playing today and it is fun so far. The crafting system is fun  combat is decent and not boring.   I don't know about the PvP system. Besides the queue times  the optimalisation is pretty good and I think it doesn't have that many bugs at launch.
1483,I started playing with a group and after a few campaigns it just seemed like it was my turn to try so others who usually GM can play. I was really bashful at first but afterwhile I realized people don't snicker at your roleplaying and theatrics because 1. they've been there and realize how hard it is. 2. You can TPK them.
1484,I started watching it a week ago and I'm already on episode 106. Really good anime. It is similar to Naruto in the sense of there being two main characters with one of them being amazing at everything and the other one being quite the opposite.   Overall  would recommend.
1485,"I started with AD&D 2nd Edition.  The game was a fantastic fantasy world simulator  and had over a decade of fantastic things built for it... but really  it felt very ""locked"" to the fantasy setting.  If you wanted sci-fi  you really needed to look elsewhere.  Rolling crappy for ability scores was also a buzzkill  but the game was played rather ubiquitously in the '90s  so nearly everyone who gamed knew the system.  When I found Rifts  I jumped in.  The power cap of D&D was shattered in that setting.  Attributes could go to 30  some like Strength could go far higher.  D&D gods couldn't have a strength higher than 25  a dragon character in Rifts might have a 30.  It offered obscenely powerful weapons and monsters in over-the-top battles.  Then I calmed down after a couple years.  I've houseruled the system into a shape I like and polished off all the warts I disliked  and Palladium really can handle any genre you want.  Once you leave Rifts  the game scales to power levels high and low  and I keep coming back to it.  I mean  they had both Ninja Turtles and Robotech in the same gaming rules  that was the coolest possible thing to me.  Along the way I've done Champions (4th)  Shadowrun (2nd)  Tons of the Old World of Darkness  Warhammer Fantasy Roleplay  WEG D6  a little bit of Paranoia  and wrote an entire RPG (and gave up on it because it was NOT awesome enough)  reluctantly played D&D 3.5  gotten my feet wet with D&D 5th  and made a couple characters for Traveler.  The only thing that really find still compelling in D&D is the spell list.  D&D has great spells."
1486,I still have flashbacks from Yoshimo in my first Baldur's gate 2 playthrough not only leaving the party but also betraying me and having to kill him. It was a unique twist I admit  but damn it he carried me through half the game!
1487,I still have mostly the same opinion on animes I watched long ago. If I liked it  I still like it. My perspective has changed a little  but its never swung so hard to go from like to cringe.  For example  Fairy Tail  a show I dropped. I would never watch it now  but if I was mind wiped and forced to watch it  I would probably drop it in about the same spot  maybe a little earlier.  But  I totally get what you mean with something like Black Butler. I would probably feel the same way had I watched it  but I didn't.  I actually have the opposite going on for shows I knew but never watched. Shows from my childhood I would think are unwatchable/cringy I love to watch now.
1488,I still have reservations about it. The trailer we got the character models looked pretty dated. Seems to be a trend with their recent games. Forspoken seems to suffer from the same dated character models. World looks gorgeous though. Combat looks fun.
1489,I still love P14's/P12's but the only place I personally install them regularly now is in our machine shop on-floor workstations. The risk of humming isn't that big of a deal when it's sitting next to a 10 000 RPM spindle roaring its way through a chunk of steel.  Office workstations/home machines I do still get Noctuas or probably the new Thermaltake T30-120's
1490,I still play D&D  because I love those stories  and keep finding new ones after 40+ years.  But it can't tell all the stories  there.   I love Cypher for the wildly strange stories that can be told with Numenera and the Strange (plus the Cypher books like Predation).  I love the magic heavy stories of Invisible Sun.  I love the hopeless horror of Dread and Call of Cthulhu.  And new mechanics with a great story  is why I try to rarely play games I know at GenCon.
1491,I still play D&D  but its not my rpg of choice. Ive found that the rules dont really allow for a more narrative style of play  it feels more adversarial (DM vs Players) than collaborative  the focus seems to be on min-maxing rather than interesting characters and the combat can be a grind with player options pretty linear.   These arent all to do with the game and are probably also indicative of the groups that Ive played with.
1492,I still really dislike Frederica  mostly because of her voice actor. It's like nails on a chalkboard. Her personality is also annoying  but she's a child  so that's normal.  The mascot tradition is also really creepy if you think about it.  The Eugene death scene was good however  so a solid episode. I do wonder how the practice of killing a comrade is seen in the republic. Before it was no big deal  since they weren't even alive  but it's different here.
1493,I still see these things around  I think the biggest drawback was how plain and pedestrian they looked. Like toyotas mark x they seemed to be trying to copy that 'early 2000s euro sedan' look which resulted in this vague blob.    Sorta like an 02 s class  or a variety of Audi offerings  maybe even the Volvo who had a much more rounded car.    In the future I think these will be fondly remembered  many years ago i thought all 90s cars were ugly as sin but I've grown nostalgic for them as have many.
1494,i store it on ikea cupboards.  when i was doing tank and aircraft model  my father made a special furniture for my diorama. imagine a square shelf with support every 20 or so centimeters. you can put boards of the needed high. this one could keep something like forty diorama. but people of my modelism club had the way for 200+.  &#x200B;  nowaday  the usual ikea-shelf-used-in-all-shops can do the same for a fair price.
1495,I suggest checking out Brackeys  that is how I started and it was super helpful. If that one isn't working out for you  there is also CodeMonkey  BlackThornProd  and Jason Weinman (all popular and good youtubers)
1496,"I suggest you start with Construct 3. It is an incredible software.  Incredibly easy to get into  and has a lot of depth.   You can begin making simple ""2-D games"" and as you progress  you can use Functions  For loop  and create your own mechanics and systems. You can learn about so much concepts like tilemaps  and data structure like arrays  dictionary and JSON directly in Construct 3. The documentation is amazing and there are hundreds of examples.  A big strength of the tool is that its very easy to get at a concrete prototype. You have the chance to see your mechanics interact quickly. In my work  I had to learn this tool. I taught it to others and this is one thing they liked about it. Many people I know still use it for quick iteration and design  even though its possible to make fully-fledged games.  If you get more experienced  you can build net applications with Websockets or AJAX/HttpRequest with Construct 3 or even peer-to-peer games. There is even 3-D graphics (a bit limited) if you're into that.  Later  most will want to transition to a more ""optimized"" game workflow. You will feel better with programming once you play with Construct 3  and you can learn anything from there on like C# or PyGames or another fancy 3-D engine. Personally  I am still using C3 to make my main project  but I was able to learn to understand programming at least things like C and Php.  This software really helped me. It's not free tho  but I really recommend it."
1497,"I suppose you can tell I don't own new cars.  Along with a 2007 Corolla and 2007 Camry  my wife has a 2005 Vibe and we have a 2000 Toyota Tundra. (Why 4 cars? Our daughter is 14 and I intend to give her the Vibe when she's 16  although I may sell something before then  undecided.) The latter two  it's so refreshing--they use ""classic"" keys  $3 or so at a hardware store and you're done. We haven't had any car thefts.   Not only that  but although I almost always buckle up  the 2000 Tundra  it's almost fully factory not much modified  but the seatbelt alarm never goes off. EVER. It's so refreshing. I absolutely cannot stand being nagged about something like that. For me  not being nagged is a very big deal.   Getting back to the chipped key thing  I almost always hang my keys up when home  but about 4 days ago ONE TIME I neglect to do so  and although the keys HAVE to be here because I drove home obviously  I absolutely cannot find them anywhere. I could really go off the rails about how God ought to get off his lazy ass and just TELL me where they are  you know as I would if it were my wife or kids  but regardless--they're gone. So you know what that means  $245 for a key to be made for my Toyota Camry (thankfully the Corolla key was on my wife's chain so it's fine).  To me  the option should exist for a buyer to have none of this nonsense on a vehicle. If I'm of the mind that I'm willing to risk it being stolen  so be it. At some point security becomes more of a headache than it's worth. I can't POSSIBLY be the only person who feels this way. Heck I in fact had a car stolen back in 2005  we got it back but what a pain in the meantime  but I still feel this way.   The way my 2000 Tundra is  good old $3 for a key and no nagging you to pieces over your seatbelt  that's how it should be."
1498,I suspect that printing costs will kill you.  You are better off using an on-demand printer and buy the originals.  On-demand printing is better quality and is often cost-competitive with printing places.  Most professional printing places will not print a commercial PDF if you don't have a license to print it.
1499,I suspect there are actually quite a few cars with a [HUD](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Automotive_head-up_display#Timeline) and no backup camera. It turns out GM started installing HUDs in the late 1980s (starting with the 1988 Cutlass Supreme) and they were available as optional equipment on many high-end cars by the mid 2000s.    The first production [backup camera](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Backup_camera#Introduction) was the 1991 Toyota Soarer  but adoption was basically non-existent until the early 2000s  since it required a screen that few cars had before nav systems stated showing up.   Its interesting that today backup cameras are mandatory equipment on the same level as seatbelts/airbags.  HUDs are not particularly common standard equipment outside of luxury cars  despite being a much simpler technology to implement (could be a simple screen that reflects off the windshield). I guess with all cars having infotainment screens these days slapping on a camera is relatively trivial. Also  the safety benefits of seeing a toddler behind your car are much higher than seeing your speed on the windshield.
1500,I suspect you'd be better off picking one of the many generic/universal systems out there. That will save you a *lot* of time and grief on trying to invent a set of mechanics that are both original and not sucky.    Depending on the feel you want  you may want to take a look at FATE  GURPS  Open D6  Savage Worlds  the Hero System  FUDGE  or . . . hmm  I know there's more out there  but I can't remember them off the top of my head. Most of those already have fantasy and sci-fi supplements already  so that could also save you some time.
1501,I switched from Unity to Godot a while back  I would I'm now an advanced-beginer. I way prefer Godot than Unity and I love the fact that it's open-source  I also don't need the power Unity have  Godot is enough for everything I wish to make. But for professional opportunity and for school  should I switch back to Unity (as there is no job for Godot dev)  I'm just wondering  I would love to continue with Godot but Unity seem to be the way to go if I want to go professional.   (I know I could learn both  but I don't have the time)
1502,I switched out P14s as my case fans because of something like this. I couldn't get the sweet spot on all 3 of them at the same time with software. They didn't bother me while in operation  at idle though I got annoyed by them.
1503,I tend agree with you. It's very frustrating  especially in combat-heavy games  when you want to rely on the synergy between party members. So missing for the huge part of game really prevent character from being useful. On the another hand  sometimes it forces you to try new combos  which can be fun. Probably  if executed well and done for the short time it's OK-ish.
1504,I tend to be the opposite. Since it's harder to spend time on games between work  family stuff  everyday household responsibilities  the gym  etc. I find myself gravitating towards shorter RPGs and indie games.  I don't need a game to last more than ten hours  really  because I probably won't spend more time on it than that. Typically that's as far as I get before some longer break in gaming takes me out of it so long that I can't get back into the game I'm playing without feeling lost.  That said  the nice thing about playing these types of games is that you get to experience a lot of different mechanics  and the games themselves are much cheaper than your typical AAA releases.  Recently the two I've really enjoyed are Battle for Esturia (short  retro RPG with a ton of charm) and The Dungeon Beneath (simple tactical dungeon battler with a lot of build combos).
1505,I tend to like classes with the best basic attack. Changes game-by-game  sometimes it's a rogue with multiple hits  sometimes it's the crit-fishing barbarian. Whoever gets me the most damage without spending MP turn over turn.      2nd favorite is any class that has a buff spell for the main attacker.
1506,"I think alot of people would define an RPG as a game with the all the following 3 traits to some degree:  **- Levelling up and stats**  **- Character actions and abilities unique to certain choices**  **- Exploration and quests**  But I think a game can have all these things and not be an RPG  and I think  personally  there's a better definition we could use. Would we call destiny 2 an RPG? No  it follows all these traits  but deep down must people can realise it's not an RPG just by touching it. Would open world Call of Duty be an RPG? No  it would also have exploration and missions  levelling up  and specific perks and weapons exclusive to certain characters  but we all know open-world CoD would not be called an RPG deep down. Now  is Skyrim an RPG? Well quite obviously yes. So what's the difference when all these games have these 3 traits we use to define an RPG  but only one is in fact an RPG?  I think to examine this we have to ask the question ""why do RPGs often have these 3 elements?"" and how are the reasons destiny 2 has these elements different. **I believe the reason RPGs often contain these elements is - they contribute to you roleplaying  the reason destiny 2 has it is to create fun meta and reward system that keeps you playing.**  If we go through each of the aspects  character choices don't make something an RPG inherently  but they define your character in your mind and therefore make roleplay easier. Exploration doesn't make something an RPG  but it allows you to get in the head of a character reacting in a free form nature to what they discover. Levelling up doesn't make something an RPG inherently  but they let you define who your character is (let's say I've made a rogue; if I put my newly-levelled stat points into strength  I know I'm roleplaying a thug  if I put those points into charisma  I know I'm playing a silver-tounged assasin). Picking your class does much the same thing  arguably more effectively. I'm not just making up the idea of this either  I find the first copies of DnD had these mechanics for this reason.  This isn't to say all RPGs focus on roleplaying equally  some games are bad RPGs and their other parts are good (see fallout 3)  whereas in some RPGs I roleplay a ton more (skyrim personally  D&D  fallout new vegas  and most crpgs). Nor am I saying if u don't roleplay you're playing an RPG wrong  this is just what I think the best definition for an RPG is  because I think if you don't enjoy roleplaying in an RPG you can get the same enjoyment from a game in a different genre which also has these elements (god of war 4 and monster hunter would be a good way to test this).  I think what we've been doing is defining an RPG not by what makes an RPG an RPG (roleplaying with an idea of who your character is)  but instead by the mechanics that are common in RPGs because those mechanics let the game be a better RPG. This would be like defining something as ice cream if it has chocolate sauce and a cornet. The chocolat"
1507,I think as you get older  and have played more and more similar games  you need genre breaks to make them interesting again. I'm old enough to have gone through from Baldur's gate 1 through pretty much every CRPG style game.  While RPG's have always been my favorite  I've still always had at least 1 shooter on deck that I play  and now countless roguelike or card battlers if I want to sit down for a session with a limited time frame (Binding of Isaac/Gungeon/Hades/Roguebook ect).  I've learned not to start a new playthrough on a CRPG out of boredom  cause that's a recipe for the playthrough getting abandoned as soon as leveling slows down.
1508,"I think both Pathfinder games apply here. I started playing Wrath of the Righteous about 2 weeks ago and my chars are about at level 7 now. And it certainly does not get easier - but under the caveat that I play RTwP mostly  as this game throws vast amounts of enemies at you. Turn-based seems to be safer for your chars lifes  but some battles take forever...   The first parts of Pathfinder: Kingmaker didn't even feel as brutal as some of the early ""Wrath""-battles and dungeons. But difficulty ramps up a lot near the end. The second-to-last dungeon is widely hated even by strong fans of the game."
1509,I think Curse of Strahd and Ravenloft Lore provides a lot. You do not have to use 5e. I know people that have played using PF  OSE  3.5  and Dungeon World.  I enjoy the campaign setting  shoehorning in an alternative game system should not be too hard. I started making a video series incorporating my own and extended lore.  If you are interested [Are you ready for Curse of Strahd.](https://youtu.be/s60LUt2xP_g)
1510,I think diceless systems have a currency you can spend to do things. I guess you get 'topped up' at certain intervals. I have never played any.  I'm curious what systems you have tried already. Many simpler systems don't use arithmetic. For example  a game where you roll a handful of d6 and succeed on a 6 would be identical to a game where you roll a handful of coloured cubes and succeed when a green face shows. The numbers are never used.  Good luck on your searches.
1511,I think going to psychologist would work if this bothers you and you cant do anything about it. Also you could try to just force your way through movie  like notebook locked  no pauses  if you think about try to focus on movie again.  But for the rule of thumb. If something is *toxic behavior* for you  thats what psychologist are for. Strangers on reddit wont have deep enough knowledge about you  to fix underlying issue. Hope it helps
1512,I think having presence in India is good for India and gives TSMC the chance to build up the industry there from scratch. My main concerns are:  * Pretty big cultural differences between Taiwan and India  * India's got a very poor power grid  * This will further increase tension with China (although  maybe that's intended?)  * Despite a 1bil+ population  I'm unclear of the talent pool to support a semi-leading-edge node
1513,I think I need to embrace the new direction that the Final Fantasy series is going.   I miss the turned based stuff  but ultimately need to realize that it's a relic of a bygone era.   Examining Final Fantasy XV I have to accept that it is a wonderful RPG with a broken story. Final Fantasy VII remake let's me know just how great the combat system CAN be in a newer Final Fantasy game and makes me really really hope they can keep this model in some shape or form.   Either way I'm sure FFXVI will be good in terms of being an action RPG. However  I have hopes that the story will be better this go around.
1514,I think I remember hearing of Alan Wake sequels talks in the past  if I'm remembering that right  this is really promising. I REALLY hope they bring it back  I especially like how Alan Wake's lore appears in Control  I want to see more of the properties sharing the same universe even if it's just referring to the other and not an intergral plot point.
1515,I think I saw you say your driving a Camaro  my advice to be a considerate driver would be to be aware of better drivers than you with less powerful cars. Just because you can take people in the straights  you might hold them up in the corners if they are a better driver. Dont have to hit 200 every straight  just hit your lines and work on shaving some time off the corners.   And also pretty much all the advice everyone else has said. Especially be humble and just enjoy yourself.
1516,"I think I will get lots of downvotes  but when I was in a similar situation Kemcos game ""Sephirotic Stories"" scratched the itch for me. The story feels complete (unlike the stories in some other Kemco games) and when you start the game you get a short summary of what happened and what you are going to do next. Its a good pick-up-and-play rpg and you can even take longer breaks without forgetting your mission. Plus its on mobile devices."
1517,"i think it depends on a lot of things  but particularly a) expectations and b) media suitability  someone invites me to a star wars game  and it's only after an hour of play i learn that there's no force/jedi in this game  i'd feel a bit put out. but if they tell me up front that there's no force/jedi  that they just wanted a familiar setting to touch base with  i'd see where they were coming from (much more immersive if you don't have to explain what everything looks like - if you know already what goblins or wookiees or traction cities are  not to mention easing the gm's burden of worldbuilding)  i think some franchises translate better to ttrpgs than others. the mcu has a pretty boring setting - take out the big name heroes and there's basically nothing of interest left - so in that case  i'd want to interact with (or even play as) the big name heroes  and that's difficult if you're keeping things strictly canonical. whereas something like star wars has so many factions  as well as it's own magic system  that it's much easier to drop new stories into that setting without disturbing the major aspects of it (take the mandalorian  for instance  or much of the clone wars)  if i might add a few more jumbled thoughts that may or may not prove handy:  it might be worth thinking of ttrpgs as similar to fanfiction. both create a dialogue with the 'original' piece of work  possibly aiming to change disliked aspects  explore that which hasn't been developed before  and involves consumers taking stories into their own hands  rather than simply as a fixed text  myth and folktale make for an interesting comparison  again disrupting the idea of the fixed text  whether that be a ttrpg rulebook or a canonical film series. vladmir propp  in his book theory and history of folklore  wrote that ""\[folklore\] presupposes two agents... namely  the performer and the listener"" (i think that'd be in the first chapter  but i'm working from the excerpt in maria tatar's norton 2nd critical edition of the classic fairy tales  p. 500). sounds a bit like the gm/player split  no? particularly since he emphasises that each listener is a potential future performer  furthermore  propp goes on to stress the changeability of folklore when compared with written literature (which is debatable  but there you go). the idea of the changing folktale  still considered at its core to be the same story despite the many different versions  is arguably pretty similar to a modular adventure. no two games of curse of strahd will ever play the same  but it's still understood to fundamentally be playing curse of strahd  morphology of the folktale (again excerpted in tatar)  propp goes on about different aspects of folktales that he considers fundamentally the same  despite their difference. setting aside his thirty-one functions (which pertain to plot)  his dramatis personae mentions such characters as the hero  the dispatcher  the donor/provider  the villain  the princess (a sought-for person)"
1518,I think it first off how realistic you want the world?   Cause someone already mentioned a youtube series that is very good in getting you into mind set of thinking about how basic geography forms.  But I think it becomes a question of what comes first for you  do you write the history first  which then dictates the geography. Or do you come up with the geography and then come up with the history.  Cause the first one you create the landscape to fit the needs of the history. Doesn't matter if you got middle earth rectangular mountain ranges surrounding Mordor. Those mountain ranges serve a purpose it a shield that allows Sauron to hide his buildup but also separates the ring bearer from any support from the forces of good when he crosses their land.  The other way  you are having to think of how the land has an impact on cultures and people. About where they form towns and cities. Having a city in the middle of a desert doesn't make sense  but that same city being next to the river that is a major trade route through the desert does make more sense.  Also you have to think of in your world is their a lot of magic or technology involved as that can lead to the building of things that before hand the environment would have made very much impossible. Like water running uphill.  Again a lot of it comes down to you as a person and what you want.  In regards to actual tools. Campaign cartographer does have fractal which allows you to make more realistic maps based on the weightings you put into it.
1519,"I think it would fit better if the reason you get your barony in the first place would not be so weird. I mean who in the world gives a barony to some random stranger  without making sure he is competent? ""Beat the Stag Lord and you get it."" is really bad imo. What if the person who beat him was a bandit leader or smth. like that? Its as if the leaders didnt care about the barony  their inhabitants and their *own* future (including trading possibilities between baronies  alliances etc.) at all. I think the story would be better if they included *multiple* pre-quests of you slowly earning their trust and getting the barony. Then the player would also feel to have earned the barony. As it is now I felt the barony was just thrown at you  not earned by serious dedication. But Pathfinders story had more issues  and the barony is one of the lesser ones."
1520,I think it'd have to be a side story if it is to not be the drizzling shits.  Detective Pikachu worked because it wasn't trying to replicate the game mechanics and cram a 20-hour campaign into 2 hours.
1521,"I think it's funny that the PF fanboys seem to be down voting anything that isn't ""Pathfinder is the best!"" so I expect this to get down voted as well.  My personal take on it...the combat mechanics  character level building  and story was better in Solasta.  But I am a D&D5E GM and player so to me  this was the purest form of D&D5E in a CRPG that I have experienced  yet.  Because of this I loved it.  It's not as long as PF:KM but it is satisfying and the combat and story are enough to keep you going and makes you want to finish it  if only to experience the very cliche ending.     I have also played PF on table top with a group of friends and I stopped playing because PF inherently is broken.  It's broken because you can create some VERY OP characters that take the fun out of it.  I believe one of my mates created a dual shield wielding tank that had an AC of like the low 30's by the time he was level 3.  Yes you read that right  he dual wielded shields.  I digress...  &#x200B;  PF:KM has some novelty stuff going on.  I played it when it came out  and rage quit after like an hour because my sorc died  like super quick.  When the turn based option came  I tried it again and was more successful.  I rolled a Slayer and had better luck.  I never finished it though.  The story just didn't capture me and the game is so mired down in character options that you can gimp yourself pretty bad if you don't follow the cookie cutter min/max builds.  I started having some severe issue with combat and began dying like all the time midgame.  I looked up some guides and found that I built my character wrong (again min maxing is almost a must).  It was about then that I started to remember my dual wielding shield mate and went...oh right...this is why I don't like PF.  And I stopped playing.  In my opinion  Solasta is the superior game  but only because WotC made D&D5E super easy and I know for some people  being able to create these weird and interesting combos of classes and skill is fun (though you are probably gimping your character)  but me...I just want to play a game  experience the story  and fight with some nice combat mechanics.  Go ahead PF fan bois...down vote me to hell  it's okay."
1522,"I think it's how DIFFERENT making games is from web development.  My favorite analogy is ""flying a plane"" vs. ""flying a helicopter"". The plane is the thing you're used to  the copter is the new thing.  To me  it's **""I can't believe how hard making a web app is.""**  All game engines feel like different types of planes to me  some propeller planes  some jet planes  some gliders. Every web framework to me feels like I don't even understand which lever my hands are supposed to grab.  Literally  I could smash my keyboard just trying to understand what the hell REACT or Vue.js are supposed to even DO for me  and what the difference between the two is. Are they even interchangeable? Are they even the same CATEGORY of things? I think they are  but what's REACT Native then  and must I use either of these with Python or JS or Ruby or what?! </hyperbolic rant  but only mildly so>  I've been making games for a long time  25+ years  18 of these professionally  in so many languages including BASIC  Assembly  Pascal  C  C++  Forth  Java  Objective-C  C#  Python  Lua  GML  GDS  ... - so I've always been thinking in terms of game loops  updates  frame buffers  render queues  etc.  It's just how we game devs train to decompose programming problems into smaller problems from the start - and that's often a temporal decomposition  in addition to the logical one. It is so second nature  which is why when I see a logic-only or transaction-only decomposition in a Ruby on Rails application  it's like it was written by mad magicians.  Object oriented modeling has been with me almost from day one  and it's a very useful tool in game dev  even if in practice  one uses composition more than inheritance. Functional programming  on the other side  is  at best  used as syntactic sugar  and generally avoided (honestly  anonymous event functions are the devil in an environment of continuously executing game code).  Conversely  thinking in terms of template engines  REST APIs  DOMs  CSS  thousands of npm dependencies  and those cursed anonymous JavaScript functions (and futures) everyone uses like they're nothing special  THAT is an entirely alien world to me... *(hey node.js devs  SIMPLY REFUSING TO NAME THINGS IS NOT AN APPLICABLE SOLUTION TO THE FACT THAT ""NAMING THINGS IS HARD!"" IN SOFTWARE DEVELOPMENT! ARRRGH!)*  **It's true that the real-time nature of game development has some unique and  so I hear  ""harder"" than average challenges.**  For one  games intrinsically have pervasive  deeply mutable state  something application developers are encouraged to avoid like the plague in many schools of web dev. Furthermore  games can have huge  very complex  faceted application and model/presenter state. Making UI in most game engines is awful  so awful in fact  that ""we"" as an industry have begun to play around with flavors CSS and even use web frameworks to display our UI.  Though maybe it's good news to you that you can make an event-driven (""reactive"") game with only minimal extr"
1523,I think it's mostly a translation issue  like when you Google translate from language A to B and back to A you won't get the same text. So  the first RPGs came from D&D where it was called 'classes'  then translated to japanese for the first JRPGs like Final Fantasy that were based on &D  and when these games were translated to English  the term was translated to 'jobs'  and it remained that way for many JRPGs that evolved from FF and others of the time.
1524,I think it's nice because it's getting a lot of people interested in TTRPGs from their favorite franchised  but also getting long time players out of their comfort system out of curiosity. It doesn't bother me as long as it doesn't become the only thing on the market  people keep making original settings and worlds so that's good.
1525,"I think modern games have way less ""gameplay density"". Be it through long forced tutorial  lore dumps  grindy repetitive missions  they seem to be designed just to add up to gameplay time.  Even some new games that are made according to old sensibilities  like Pillars of Eternity  suffer from this. I've been replaying the original Baldur's Gate  and it's a game that can be played even in short burst  and it never feels like it's wasting your time. The story is revealed incrementally and companions manage to be interesting even without talking much. No single word is wasted. Compare it with PoE where the game starts bombing you with lore and ridiculous storytelling (""the souls of the wyewc need to be saved from the sword of the eywviyzx  to prevent the god of zwectwighar to rise"" or some kind of nonsene) right of the start  and in ever opportunity.  My advice is to either play old games  or more action oriented titles. Check [howlongtobeat.com](https://howlongtobeat.com) and focus on games with short completion times.  One nice exception is Divinity: Original Sin 2 which is 100 hours long and managed to be engaging all the way through."
1526,I think most 2 door muscle/sports coupe/hot hatch  or convertible looks a thousand times better than a 4 door ecobox sedan  or crossover. My friend thought about putting nice rims on his Prius and I told him don't even bother  as no one would notice  or even care.
1527,"I think most modern VW's will. Volkwagen has always been conservative with their styling  and while they never really stand out  they also never look offensively outdated. Arteon with its ""chasing the trend"" big grill won't look that great in 10 years."
1528,I think my love of cars is a subset of my love of machines  and that goes all the way back. My first word was bobby  which supposedly I intended to mean Garbage Truck. My favourite book as a kid was Cars & Trucks & Things That Go by Richard Scarry.    When I met my ex she didn't know anything about cars. She could at most tell you the colour. By the time we broke up she had come so far! its a fun nerdiness to share.
1529,I think one of the biggest issues i have is burnout. I have a head full of ideas  and between my day job  working on commissions  and learning how to improve my artwork  it's hard to find the time to work on my own bigger projects.  Really time management  or management in general has always been my biggest issue with art. I have like 2 years worth of unfinished illustrations or ideas just collecting dust.  It's gotten better over the years  but I can't stress this enough  discipline yourself and dont waste time! If you can find an art community you can interact with  and help one another critic  and reach goals together  it can help a lot.  I like to be competitive  but for the sake of making better art  and it can be tough to pursue that with no other similar artists to bounce off of.  Its easier to find your inspiration  jot down some character concepts or write notes for a story. But i think it's very difficult to see that all at once. My recommendation to myself and others would be  pace yourself(dont be lazy tho)  find a goal and work towards it(with or without art buddies)  and dont sell yourself short.  If you're sure this is a career path for you  than work hard and be confident. Others may already be on their uptick of their journeys and it does nothing helpful to compare yourself to them. You are one person  and should set your expectations accordingly(high expectations but not too unrealistic).
1530,I think people have unreasonable expectations for portable devices in general. You see it a lot when people talk about the Switch being underpowered even though it was very up to date for 2017. Even now people seem to think a 4K Switch Pro that trades blows with the Series S is feasible. The Steam Deck is about as powerful as you can reasonably make a 2021 handheld  yet it still falls short of a traditional console or gaming laptop. The Deck is awesome because it will let people run most games in 720p/60fps/low if they tune the settings. It's never going to be an on-the-go full-fat console experience.
1531,I think that as I've gotten older  my standards for story  characters  and dialogue have exponentially increased. It's rare to find a game that meets those standards  so I usually care most about gameplay. If the gameplay is good enough  it could keep me interested and playing.  That said  have you played Disco Elysium? That's one of those rare games that impressed me with its story  dialogue  etc. Loved every minute of that game  and I played it twice. I cannot think of the last time I replayed a game right after beating it. This may have been my first time actually...
1532,I think that developers have covertly and sometimes less covertly been integrating addictive gaming patterns (aka dark patterns) into most games so aggressively that we're starting to burn out on the stimulus reward cycle. MMOs are a prime example but seasonal games and loot shooters are just as bad. The kind of rpg games that we all used to love can no longer compete with the instant gratification cycle of modern games.
1533,I think that Kenshi actually captures the true essence of RP over any other game Ive played. Its a Sandbox RPG. There is no main questline  and in fact there are no quests in the game at all. Theres no story to follow  no exclamation mark NPCs to check off your list. You can play any way you like  and its extremely immersive.   Lets say you want to be a mercenary. Well you can train up your fighting skills. You have to start out taking low reward bounties that only require you to attack maybe one person and bring them in. Later youll be able to attack groups of people in order to take their leader in for a hefty bounty reward.   Lets say you want to be a merchant and want to RP being weak. Thats fine  just dont level any attack skills and hire yourself some guards to bodyguard you as you travel with your caravan.   Want to be a farmer but dont want to own your own farm  go find a farm and do that.  Want to own your own farm? Do that.  Want to be a miner? Go right ahead  theres stone  iron  and copper.   Want to be a merchant? Set up your own stall and get to work!   Theres a bunch of possibilities in Kenshi  and I think if youre looking for a truly free and unguided experience  its the way too go.
1534,I think that one shots are a good way to get past that issue. Give the characters a self contained story with a satisfying conclusion and maybe choosing a rules light game so that character creation isn't a time investment in itself.  Then when one of your longer games has it's conclusion you can consider using one of the systems used for a one shot for a new story. Maybe even give your players the option to use the characters from said one shot. That way you can occasionally break the monotony of the main campaign whenever your characters experience a some kind of climatic end to an arc in that campaign. That way your players won't have the frustration of not being able to continue the story of their favorite characters and you will be able to dip your toes into another system and setting.
1535,"I think that people overrate the concept of the ""Skinner Box"" and apply it to everything that has any sort of action-reward sequence. I don't think it should be applied in all situations. People claim gameplay is repetitive  but even relatively minor variations can be both engaging  and go beyond what is described by Skinner. I also want to be clear that Skinner **specifically studied animal behavior.** Do humans work exactly the same? There are studies  but you can't just take the original experiment and assume anything we're talking about actually applies.  Giving XP for multiple things just lets players actually choose the things they want to do. **You don't have to do everything.** Maybe some people want to fight a lot of enemies  maybe others like to explore a lot more  maybe others like to focus on crafting. Not giving rewards for these things (and still giving them for other things) just tells players ""The thing you find engaging in this game? We don't want you to be doing it. Do this other thing that rewards you instead.""  This is not necessarily an effect of trying to get players to be addicted. It's an effect of trying to make games appeal to as many different players as possible.  It is true that games are ""not fleshed out"" in some ways. But the reality is that there is no ceiling to how much game can be in a game. Just like there is no maximum length to a book. For games  players often expect a certain number of hours  and so there is some ""padding"" but also in most games  this stuff is pretty optional. I'll also say that this isn't really a change. Older games jerked players around plenty  especially older RPGs."
1536,I think that the infinity engine games; Baldurs Gate  Icewind Dale  Planescape Torment  and Baldurs Gate 2 are my favorite series.  I love AD&D  Im always the DM so I really appreciate the computer handling all the heavy lifting so that I can just relax and experience a damn good facsimile of tabletop DND on my own!  But to respond to your choices  I think that the final fantasy series ( inspired originally by DND {partially} I must add) is what drew me to pen and paper rpgs in the first place.  Final fantasy tactics is one of the best tabletop combat simulators I can think of!  I think FF 6  7  9  10 and tactics had a little special something that separates them from their peers  but Ive played all of them.  Great games  and I have great memories of the adventures and companions-
1537,I think that the most fun thing to do with evil cults is to have the bulk of the cult be completely ignorant to what it is that they're a part of.  Think of the large (but purposefully unnamed) religious cults that you can think of which are maybe all love and hugs and sunshine and being nice to each other  but the farther up the pyramid you climb  the stranger and more questionable the beliefs get till you reach the upper echelons and the people there are disgusting  greedy  immoral  and amoral monsters.  What if they *ran* an animal rescue instead of just volunteering at one  and on the surface it looked like they were just doing a steady stream of collecting  caring for  and putting animals up for adoption.  What if everyone involved who was working at the shelters was 100% on board and honestly doing that  but the people actually *running* the show were actually using it to collect animals for dark and evil cult-ey rituals?  Now what if it was an orphanage and not an animal rescue?
1538,I think the 2013/14 Sn197 Mustang's look great  as well as have those LED Taillights that mix retro looks with the modern styling. Even the last iteration of the Scion TC (2016ish) looked pretty good to me and still holds up to this day.   On the other end what modern cars do you think will not age very well? I think the C8 stingray is over styled and will look weird in the coming years  although I love that car and will happily be wrong.
1539,"I think the experience largely depends on whether the end product is a dozen pages long or hundreds.  I would recommend you start with the dozens - even if that's just stuff you are writing for your own use.  &#x200B;  I am currently writing my first big TRPG book. It's page count has been racking up and up and up. At the same time  I have been releasing [excerpts of that book](https://www.drivethrurpg.com/product/356622/Vintage-Gothic-Teaser-of-Terror) (three in total) that in a roundabout way fit the bill for the shorter type of product mentioned earlier.  I started writing at the start of the year. I expected the full product to be done and out by August. That didn't happen. I'm now aiming for April.  If you intend on writing a big project it will take longer than you think. Life will get in the way for one thing  and some parts will be faster to write than others. If your game contains statblocks or lots of tables: Those take longer than more ""stream of consciousness"" rules writing. I found that out the hard way by leaving the monster statblock section of my book til last: It takes **ages** and it's not very creatively rewarding than many of the other chapters I have written.  &#x200B;  The other thing - regardless of size - is that you want to be playing the game as you write it. Get your players on board to play and given them alpha chapters. Whenever you write something new  give them a new version. Don't leave it 'til your game is done to start testing it: Do it iteratively.   &#x200B;  And the last thing: Use publishing software - not word processor software. I use Affinity Publisher; Some others use the Adobe equivalent. It will save you a lot of headache compared to doing it in Word."
1540,i think the F30 series BMWs will become classics  i know  current gen -1 and all  but the last generation of 3/4 seriess will go down as the last blend between driving dynamics and proper BMW styling
1541,I think the first gen toyobaru triplets  Vipers (all of em)  GR Yaris  Jaguar XJ and XK(2010-2017)   C7(who didn't see that coming?)   Fiat 124(basically Mazda's equivalent to the Zagato MR-S)   Arial Atom   BAC mono  Praga R1R   2012 911 Targa 4S (panoramic roof since 2001)   Lotus Evora and Exige (applies to all generations)   370z(it will be treated the same as the 240z was bet on it)   R232 SL and black series variant  Civic type R and S660(U.S didn't get it q.q)   Toyota Mirai and the Tesla model s as two divergent paths to the future. I believe these will be the classics some 20-30 years from now.
1542,I think the funniest games I have ever run have been with normal systems. I think in some way  the world of a normal game can work well as the straight man to the partys antics.   Unless you need wacky character archetypes  something like Stars Without number works great as a sandbox.
1543,"I think the S550 Mustangs will age fairly well. They're not overstyled  and in my opinion have great proportions. The other obvious choice would be basically any Aston. On the other end of the spectrum I think current crossovers and particularly ""modern"" looking cars will become dated pretty quickly. Things like the newer Hyundais. They look good now  but realistically I think they're too busy and trying too hard to look modern."
1544,I think the short-lived [Buick Cascada looked great on the outside  but that center infotainment stack is atrocious](https://imgur.com/a/PENeU8s). Looks like a TV remote with all of those buttons.  Edit: I read this post wrong  thought it asked for cars with pretty exteriors and horrendous interiors. You can point to almost any British luxury car for the original question lol. Modern [Land Rovers](https://i.imgur.com/E9RFhfl.jpeg) [and Jaguars](https://imgur.com/a/A1HHDnv) look gorgeous without a doubt but I expect 9/10 made have electrical issues down the line.
1545,"I think the term for this is ""DM Drop"" and I've absolutely experienced it before. Usually I get it after a very good or very bad session.   Without too many gritty details  this is the same thing that can happen after an intense BDSM session; both BDSM and TTTPGs generally have a longer period of high emotional energy. We can look at using the same aftercare tactics  such as doing something silly and lighthearted (I've been watching Gravity Falls) or having a cuddle  if that's an option for you.   My aftercare as a DM also includes stars and wishes  where everyone at the table goes around and says one thing they liked about the session and one thing they want to see in a future session. It's a good way to get some feedback with it feeling like the players are piling on the GM.   Hope this helps!"
1546,I think the trick is knowing your constraints (your abilities) and keeping it simple. I completed some simple platformer and puzzle games in unity  after 2-3 months of learning to code from youtube tutorials.
1547,I think there are certain anime that are carried single-handedly by the main character  like Code Geass  Steins;Gate  Trigun  and Welcome to the NHK  to name a few. I also think they're anime that are single-handedly carried by more secondary characters  like Galaxy Express 999 (which Maetel carries) and The Melancholy of Haruhi Suzumiya (which Haruhi carries  despite Kyon being the main character). What other examples can you think of?
1548,I think this is about to be me.  I've only ever run dnd since i got into the hobby  and have started to build up a library of other systems and adventures I'd like to run.  It's gotten to the point where I daydream about my next game more than I think about my current.  Luckily this currently campaign is coming to an end  and my players have already said they'd be down to try Shadow of the Demon Lord.
1549,I think this is great advice. On a related note I read *Return of the Lazy Dungeon Master* a few months ago and highly recommend it. The core thesis of that book is basically Crawford's quote but also offers tips and suggestions on where to focus and where you can fill in details later or on the fly. Having spent a lot of my gaming life preparing and occasionally over-preparing  I found it eye-opening.
1550,I think top down is fine the way it is used. They're not generally there to give a detailed view  their purpose is to help with games where distance and terrain matters for combat scenes.  You might have more success with some sort of package that shows a location from the front to help with mental image/mood setting and adding the top down map in case combat occurs
1551,I think trinity from onyx path would be a good fit.  [https://www.drivethrurpg.com/product/260788/Trinity-Continuum-Core-Rulebook](https://www.drivethrurpg.com/product/260788/Trinity-Continuum-Core-Rulebook)  Some of the adventures are in the style of leverage  atomic blonde  and macgyver.  https://www.drivethrurpg.com/product/272162/Trinity-Continuum-In-Media-Res
1552,"I think what really makes a game GM friendly is the kind of GM tools you get. Everything from Sine Nomine includes great resources for making locations  NPCs  factions  etc... Up on the fly. I'd recommend Spears of the Dawn with the intro adventure House of Bone and Amber. The adventure includes a guide to the town with encounters and rumors and 6 ""dungeons"" to explore - i think only three of which are used in the political murder mystery adventure itself."
1553,I think you are overestimating the difficulty by saying that anyone who can complete the most basic game should receive an insane amount of respect. I'm quite surprised that you say that as a web developer.  Or maybe you didn't actually mean the most basic game  but the most basic game that SALES?
1554,I think your totally right. One thing that stood out to me was about how 'leveling up' does not make a game an RPG in and of itself because It has to contribute to your ability to actually role play the character.  To piggyback  there are a lot of games with this concept of a sort of 'infinite conveyor belt of upgrades' where your character just auto-levels up every so often and your stats get better but you really have little to no choice in how your character actually develops. They're often considered RPGs but I don't really think so. For example  a lot of idle tap games (tap heroes) do this  some might say Diablo/Torchlight do it  or even the some of the final fantasy/zelda genre games. These games all might appear to be an RPG because they have a leveling up system  and they're all good games for what they are. I just don't really think they're RPGs because of that lack of character customization.
1555,I think youre at a disadvantage  yes  particularly when it comes to understanding architecture and design patterns used which determine a lot of how youre supposed to connect various pieces together. OOP books will probably help a lot  but in general there is a lot of game development which is very hard relative to other areas like web or mobile. Being self taught is fine but game dev specifically has a lot of difficult paradigms and concepts and a system like Unity or Unreal assumes you know them.  That being said dont assume school will fix that. Just study a lot in those areas. There are plenty of books on game development design patterns.
1556,"I think you're not taking into account the history of RPGs. In the beginning  computer RPGs have one single purpose: to emulate the feeling of playing a tabletop RPG on the computer. The dungeon master in this case  is replaced by the computer. Tabletop RPGs had stats and levels  and thus computer RPGs had the same thing. Same goes with the rest: interactions with NPCs  powers  spells  equipment  etc.  This is in an era where games like Pac-man and Mario exists. These are games focused on gameplay  like platforming  scoring points  and such. Action games like Doom  Wolfenstein 3D  Duke Nukem 3D and such were focused on promoting gameplay as well. In that era  RPGs stood out because they were primarily a simulation of a tabletop experience on the computer.  When we got better computing power  developers of ""pure games"" started implementing RPG concepts into their games  creating hybrids like Diablo  where you have RPG elements but the main gameplay is focused around killing things and picking up loot  not unlike old games like Crusader: No Remorse  or Syndicate. Then you have Baldur's Gate that came along and popularized the infinity engine style RPG concepts where you have branching story paths  deep interaction and recruitable NPCs  epic storylines  and more focus on lore and setting. Note  these things already exist previously in games like Dark Sun and Wasteland  they just got popular because of Baldur's Gate's success.  Today  it's kinda hard to define RPGs in a clean way because RPG elements have been proven to be so much fun that a game without any form of progression would seem out of place in today's world. As such  I don't think the classical definition of RPGs no longer applies today. It's easier to instead define a game based on its lineage.  For instance  Pathfinder Wrath of the Righteous comes from the Baldur's Gate lineage; Bethesda's Fallout comes from the Elder Scrolls lineage  and so forth. Then you have tags like  blobbers  dungeon crawlers  rogue-likes/lites  MMORPGs  souls-likes  etc. which should better inform the player on what to expect going into the game."
1557,I thought Ford cancelled all their cars  except the Mustang  since the only thing people seem to want these days is trucks and SUVs? Even their new EV is an SUV.  Edit: Thanks and upvotes to all below who reminded me to keep a global perspective  and educated me with your perspective. People who give a shit are the best. 
1558,I thought that I hated this mechanic as well as losing my inventory  until last night I played as half naked Jolee cutting troopers in half with nothing but a long sword and jedi powers in KotOR. It can be done right but it is rare.
1559,I thought they already did this a few months ago... Is MS saying the games now run the Series X versions of the games rather than Series S? As far as I'm aware  despite being on Series X hardware every game ran the Series S or Xbox One S version of the game with the exception of Xbox 360 and Xbox games which run the Series X enhancements.
1560,I took a 6-month break and I'm enjoying games again.  Playing slowly through LOTRO of all things  taking it slow and casual and loving the hell out of it.  Take some time off.  Paint your house or something.
1561,I took a break from CRPGs to play more action oriented games like the Yakuza series  Horizon Zero Dawn etc. I recently wanted to start a playthrough of the new Pathfinder but couldn't get past the character screen because I have no idea want I want to do or be. So I tried to start a CRPG (Planescape Torment) I've had in my backlog forever and I had the same issue  I just have no idea how my character should be. I've always rejected the idea of researching the best stats etc. as I don't want my character to be overpowered  I just want him to fit in with the lore.  I feel like I got so used to playing a pre-existing character (and loving them) that now I feel lost when I have to make one by myself. I've never been very creative but I could always come up with something simple to go on.   Does anyone relate to this at all  or have any general tips to get a fresh start to cRPG's?
1562,I took a look at this adventure module  because I hadn't heard of it before. It has a similar tag line to Mork Borg(heavy metal inspired grimdark fantasy game)  which was kickstarted a few months earlier  but didn't earn nearly as much as your kickstarter did. How much influence did 5e have on your kickstarter's success? Or was there something else that was key?
1563,I tried it but stopped for the moment  since the German translation is very buggy and mixed with polish  which makes it hard to progress. I didn't solve the first case yet  not sure if I like the style of the game. Setting is great tho
1564,I tried playing Baldur's Gate 1&2 and had to drop both of them before I could get my first level up. Before that  the only CRPG I played was Divinity: Original Sin 2.  I seriously wish I could understand the appeal to these games  as I don't go into games just to hate them.  But the more I tried to like these games  the more stupid and useless I felt.    After about an hour of banging my head against the wall  I finally came to grips with the clunky squad-based controls and confusing menus.  But the actual gameplay didn't get any better for me after that.    Items seem to be really important  but the game has some Draconian inventory restrictions.  Each character can only carry a handful of items  but every random chest or table will have about 30 items and you have to figure out which are relevant by squinting at every single item page.  And if the person picking up the item has a full inventory  you can't hand it to someone else- you have to physically drop something just to make space.  Then hand it off.  It's not so simple as having the person who wants the item to pick it up  since you need a designated lockpicker/trap disarmer to get it in the first place.    It felt like I was spending way too much time micromanaging items when I wanted to beat people up.     The early game in BG1 feels horribly paced.  After leaving the first town  you are left to wander aimlessly across a bunch of vast  ugly gray fields  begging for scraps of EXP.  You get the exp from dry quests that give shitty rewards  and baby goblins that die in one hit and give you 2 EXP when you need thousands.  I keep expecting to get SOMEWHERE where SOMETHING can happen  but nope.  Just more gray fields and oh my party just got wiped by some bear who was overleveled for my party when nothing has been making my people stronger. Guess I'll reload my save and check this boring depressing gray field instead.   Baldur's Gate 2 comes across as even more overwhelming because it assumes you played BG1.   I made it out of the initial dungeon and dropped it because I was overwhelmed by being dumped in a huge ugly gray town full of people with exhausting dialogue options.    IDFK.  Maybe I really am just too stupid and simple minded for this.  I thought questing was too confusing in DOS2  too. I am motivated by combat and character progress  not by exploration or story or playing a role.
1565,I tried Solasta but the story and dialogue are shit if we're being honest  and that's what I go to RPGs for.   I recently started Kingmaker and am adoring the characters and I haven't even gotten out of the first ~chunk/tutorial area~ yet  so take that as you will.
1566,I turned 18 in 1981. The 80s should be my decade  but the music was awful (Wham! Madonna)  the fashion was awful (double denim and mullets anyone?) and it was a thoroughly depressing time. So  no interest from me in an 80s era RPG.
1567,I understand how you feel. I am primarily a web developer  but make games for fun. I have no problem building a web app from ideation to deployment. I can do everything myself.   Different story for game dev! I don't exactly think it's harder  but the volume of work is MUCH higher! Using something like Tailwind or Bootstrap  a fair portion of the design is done for a site. For a game  3d modeling/animation is sooooo time consuming if you are primarily a solo coder.
1568,I understand its not possible for people to know whats going to be a classic car in 20 years  but objectively the car community can sometimes have an idea during a cars production run. Im talking about examples like the BMW M2  Porsche GT3 RS  etc.  What I want to know is did you happen to buy something like the original Ford Bronco because it fit your needs then  but now seems to be all the rage? Maybe you bought an FJ Cruiser  which I originally found hideous  but now think theyre pretty cool.  Anyway  Id love to hear your stories on this topic.
1569,I understand what you're going through because I am going through the same thing. I can play an RPG and really enjoy it  but after some hours I begin to get a bit bored and play something else.  I am not sure why  but it just gets difficult to keep at it. It's almost like I don't have as much patience anymore.
1570,"I understand what you're saying. You go from having fun  connecting with people  and truly expressing yourself  to a sudden collapse into nothing. That's completely normal  and has followed me after many occasions. One second we are going out with friends  coming back from a good date  or seeing a family members for a holiday; afterward  we're often left drained  saying ""well  that ended quickly "" and typically just as we were begining to notice it was great. Don't worry; all in all  it's good and human to having something to love and miss.  In my opinion  and what has often worked best for me  is getting out  taking a walk/run  working out (kickboxing is great!)  writing about my thoughts  reading a book  tending to the yard  or shifting my focus on to whatever I may do for someone else (my wife  children  etc.).   In my experience  action was the only way to counter a rut  and  should that not help  I was more often than not tired and in need of some good rest.  Best of luck on yourself and finding that balance we all strive to keep."
1571,I use [*Freeform Universal* RPG](http://freeformuniversal.com) with my kids; as it is universal it enables us to play within the setting of whatever show or book is catching their fancy at the moment.  There are a number of [hacks](http://freeformuniversal.com/hacks)  including [*Lego FU* RPG](https://drive.google.com/file/d/0B3R-9N6W5fhBdmVack5wVHlxSU0).  Stock *Freeform Universal* is very streamlined and so is very easy for children to play  but it was not specifically designed for children which means that they can continue to use it into their adulthood as well.
1572,I use a branded account for my game because we're a team and I don't want to post personal tweets there to keep it clean and dedicated only to our game. But I see a lot of successful personal accounts in the indie community. Since you already went as far as removing followers  I'd suggest keeping the same account. But if you need an account to post random stuff  keep them separate.
1573,I use a modifier set of Masque of the Red Death. Basically  you can apply it to any armor class system. Guns deal d6 damage for lowest calibur all the way up to 3d6+1. They treat armor class as Unarmored at short range  -6 at second range and -5 at long range. In addition  all gun dice explode -- rolling a six on any damage die gives an additional die of damage. And if you own Masque  you can use the ROF table to determine how many shots you can fire off per round. I've started applying these rules to all systems I use when using contemporary & modern guns.
1574,"I use Crunchyroll for subs and Funimation for dubs. Being that Sony owns both now  I'm not sure if the two will he merged or what  but I really don't think you can go wrong with those two as your source for Anime. I think Netflix may be adding ""Monster"" in the future  it would be worth keeping just for that show  imo  at least until you watch the series  it's a masterpiece."
1575,I used to always play mages/wizards until...NWN 2 I think it was.....when I decided to finally change it up and play a dual wielding rogue. Been running those in games and tabletop as a main ever since.
1576,I used to be very guilty of this sort of thing.  I'd find a new system  pitch it to the group  and then get the ball rolling.  Even if we were in the middle of an existing campaign.  Nowadays I have a bit more self-control.  I try to wrap up the campaign  or at least the plot arc  before moving onto the next thing.  Unless the last thing wasn't working out - I had started up Rhapsody of Blood as a secondary campaign to run parallel to my PF1e game  but quickly realized that the PF game wasn't working out and RoB was just a lot more fun for everyone.
1577,I used to severely over prepare my campaigns.  These days I just crank out a few bullet points in response to the events of the last session.  The most detailed things I might do are to plan an encounter and a map.  Even then I won't allow myself to plan for longer than the total length of the session (four hours).
1578,I used to work for a company that did software work for small businesses. We prevented scope creep by refusing to adjust a project until the current development stage was delivered. We would modify previous work but only after that work was complete and tested.
1579,I usually agree  though for the outgoing civic/si I dislike the appearance of the 10th gen civic sedan but love the look of the si coupe. For me it was almost entirely aesthetic       I absolutely understand why the FWD coupe died off  but in my case I have yet to really be inconvenienced by it being only 2 doors. You get so much interior space with modern civics that it's still a pretty practical car in coupe form.
1580,I usually disregard posts about JRPGs and keep scrolling because they haven't been my thing for about 15 years  but I'm obligated to stop when I see someone acknowledge that Persona existed before the 3rd game. 2 is my favorite in the series (I enjoy Eternal Punishment more than Innocent Sin ) so it's nice to see some love for it. Have my rare upvote just for mentioning it.  Edited to say: Sorry  I have no input on that other game you're talking about  lol. I guess I just wanted to thank you for recognizing that P2 is excellent.
1581,I usually give it to the main char  or the char I like the most unless won't be useful.  AKA a char that rarely needs mana I won't give mana boosting items.  By this I mean like tales of  or dragon quest items that permanitly give you +X to attack  or such.
1582,I wanna try out rogue trader with my friends but I haven't been able to find any resources for an introduction or a sort of rules of play.  Is there anywhere I can go to get a rough intro to playing rouge trader?
1583,I wanna watch more anime this season. Can anyone tell me about this one? I know it's about a boy (presumably the Paladin) raised by three undead  but I guess I'm looking for more like the genre  the audience  subjectively if y'all think it's good or not  that kinda thing.
1584,I want to explore every thing  that includes locked stuff and dialog options. If a class is linked to those (usually a talkative rogue)  I'll go for that.  If combat is the only difference (sad face)  then I'll go for whatever offers board controls (stun  slow  movement based abilities) and if possible can dish out buffs and support to a party if there is one.   If the system uses a weakness system (e.g. elemental stuff) then I'll try to play with that.  If it's a solo game then stealth  if there's no stealth (and none of the above apply) then whatever makes combat shorter because we kinda ran out of interesting things to do.
1585,"I want to know what its like making a TTRPG so I can make one in the future  I thought of an idea for a TTRPG called ""War of the Realms"" which is about a war between an early industrial fantasy world and a Hard Sci-Fi fleet from another universe that they accidentally cut themselves off from and they want to colonize the nearest earthlike planet than found the fantasy world"
1586,I want to move away from D&D (still have to finish this last campaign!) because:  1. The battles take an excessively long amount of time  especially after level 10. This is probably the most frequent source of the feeling of frustration with the game.  2. The players have so much hitpoints/HP that it is a long time before they are actually feeling any danger  3. The magic-user players have tons of unfair advantages over the non-magic players and it's possible but quite difficult to balance both of them  4. Too many challenges (travel  survival  single large enemies) are too easily solved by simply using a magic spell  often not even requiring a roll  5. The default D&D setting includes basically all tropes and themes  so that the setting lacks flavor by being a kitchen-sink that includes everything. For example  the whole idea of a difficult journey to a new world to encounter a new race and culture is lost when your basic D&D includes a hundred races all living close together  6. D&D players become so powerful that there's little incentive to interact with npcs or challenges except by smashing them
1587,I want to prepare a one shot horror rpg for halloween  i wanto to make a zombies scenario (not post apocalypse) like kids visiting a cemetery and zombie raise from graves.  I need an advice for a light rpg rules (zero prep or near)  My first thought was Truth & Daring but i want some more (but not a lot) rules.  I already saw   Ten candles : not good  all die  they don't like it.  Dread: They don't like Jenga
1588,I want to see the single core score.  That 5.3 ghz clockspeed makes me think it wont be much better than competitors. Otherwise they would clock it lower to have better power consumption.  On the other hand I like buying products that operate close to their max capability  I don't like overclocking.
1589,I want to start developing a small game on my own. The basic idea I have in mind is a 2D pixel-style game where you are basically fighting against the world itself: You will have to manage your way through certain levels by building your way over obstacles present in the level. The world will try to destroy your buildings  thus making it progressively harder for you to get to the end of the level. I know it's a very vague idea at the moment. However  I do not want to stop halfway through because I notice the idea is not working. What would you suggest doing in this situation? Should I just start and waste time in the worst case?
1590,I want to start making my own games and I have for years but never had the ability. Now that I do I don't know how to start. I find I always plan to big but lose interest and quickly drop small projects and  don't know the true size of gaming I plan to only make one level and make it 2d as I don't know 3d modelling (If I did I would do 3d) but I don't know how complex to make the level. I can draw and code and have been practicing and studying design as that is the specific field I plan to join. I plan this as just a hobby and nothing big. So if yo have ideas on the complexity of the game please help me out.
1591,I want windows that can darken like the ones on a 787. Perhaps it could be tied with a light sensor to be darker when the sun is out and lighten up as it gets darker outside so the amount of light coming into your car is consistent throughout the dat.
1592,I wanted a classless system where hit points represented health  not an arbitrary Mish mash of health and defense. Multiple skills to represent a character and a dice system that uses a bell curve and not a linear curve.   I've always played traveler and cthulu and twilight 2000 but it was cyberpunk 2013 and 2020 that really opened my eyes to what I wanted out of characters and skills. (This game failed because of dice rolling conventions as well)   As another player notes below  I don't feel that I moved away from d&d entirely but it definitely moved away from me during my long hiatus away.  3.5 was one giant cluster fuck of little special rules and classes and became seriously bloated. 4th was an MMO clone and now we have 5th. These systems work but are not my style anymore. Oddly enough though I am corunning a 5th edition campaign.
1593,I wanted less crunch  easier learning curve for newbie/casual players  and the baked-in ability to run adventures/campaigns in other genres/worlds.   I still love DnD (and am a player in a 2nd edition campaign) but  I likely wont ever run it again. I ended up drifting so far away from DnD that I made my own system from the ground up (rules lite  universal  player facing rolls  D10 based) and it does exactly what I want it to.   Cheers!
1594,I wanted to spend less time reading or debating rules and more time doing cool things.  I wanted to look at my character sheet less and think more about the environment my character was in. I play online a lot  so moving away from battle maps was nice too.
1595,I was a huge fan of crpgs from the late 80s through the 90s. Played those games for hours on end. I dont know if Its more I changed or the games changed  but I just cant get a into them anymore. The movie style dialogue drives me nuts. I deal with enough palace intrigue at the office. Dont need it in a game.   Of semi-recent games  Skyrim was still very appealing as with the latest Diablo. KC-D was neat  but I eventually got bored of it. Think that was my fault by focusing too much on the side quests.  DA-O way too much dialogue. Divinity 2 had promise  but was really hard and specific about how to complete everything. Eventually quit. Disco - eh  maybe Ill try it again. There was another recent old school one I actually finished  but cant remember the name!  Lots of sailing around. The time spent traveling on each quest was wearing on me  but overall pretty good. Just giving you my opinions to show where Im coming from.
1596,I was actually getting so mad with how many death flags is getting thrown  it was getting so obvious and it sucks that that is probably the writers intention the writer is living inside my head rent-free please help me the writer is inside my head
1597,I was always interested in cars but I didn't love them until I got my hands on a couple of episodes of Top Gear and enjoyed the way they presented a car as a story. My father is a difficult man to get to know but he did like to talk about cars so once I started learning more about them  we were able to start bonding over that.
1598,I was born in '74  and the 80s are MY JAM. The music was great  the fashions were rad  and even though I spent most of the decade being kidnapped in a foreign country (100% true story  I'm not joking for once)  it's my favorite period of my life. So  yeah  gimme.
1599,"I was checking out this studios career site and the requirements to be a QA analyst seem bare compared to the other jobs they have listed. Whats the average salary? Google says $72k but that doesn't sound right.     ### ""Who we are looking for:  * Work with the Lead QA Analyst to create and implement comprehensive  effective  and detailed Quality Plans and Test Procedures for all assigned games. * Ensure our game products meet high standards of quality  reliability  usability  and performance through hands-on testing and problem reporting. * Interpret  analyze  and evaluate testing progress at specific Milestones related to QA deliverables and platform-specific content and functionality requirements. * Perform focused sweeps  ensuring Microsofts  Sonys  and Nintendos technical requirements. * Escalates high priority issues to appropriate parties. * Own the compliance testing process and pipeline for the game team. * Strong knowledge and experience with SMITE. * A natural collaborator with strong communication skills  written and verbal. * Curious minded with an eagerness to learn and share best practices."""
1600,I was crying on dlc prices at first for eu4  but when you can play a game for thousands hours it worth the price. So much people are buying 60 games and play it for 20 hours  then the next year a new one is out. Eu4 is a masterpiece
1601,I was enjoying the game  but I had the misfortune of purchasing it as part of the Humblebundle in whatever month that was.  At first it ran fine  despite having that weird old build where it still required internet connectivity despite saying that it didnt. It would just freeze in the menu if you werent connected.  Then  they released a patch that fixed that issue  but that broke all the texture LOD stuff for me which had previously worked fine. Suddenly I was getting random low texture stuff I was standing right next to  and it seemed to get worse the longer you played. Only ever lasted about five minutes before it started  and often less.  Its a real pity  because by all accounts its a good game  and I was enjoying it  but that hatchet job they did to release the humble version on steam without DLC just seemed to screw everything up. It must be an old build theyre using  because if you google solutions  these issues all existed but have been fixed for people with the real steam version.  Really puts me off purchasing their stuff again though  because its a pretty crummy thing to do just to try and force some exclusivity DLC deal with humble and then lie about it.
1602,I was going to suggest a thermographic camera  but to people from a fantasy world  that's going to be a hard sell.    Hmm  how about a strip of cloth with magical incantations sewn into it? Wear it like a blindfold  and you can see ghosts . . . and pretty much nothing else. Bonus creepy points if you can still see them with your eyes closed. Decide ahead of time whether it works if they find a way to wear it over only one eye  the loophole-finding spoilsports.    Hmm  what if you could see ghosts through any glass that a person had on them at death? Prescription glasses are the obvious answer  but guess what? They're not in *your* prescription  are they?
1603,I was hoping theyd stick it out for Alder Lake so I could pick up a binned model as my good enough for a long time CPU but looks like Ill just need to settle with whatever roll I get.  Sad to see them go  but definitely understandable.
1604,I was just about to buy a kindle paperwhite on sale (99) - should I wait for this one? I wouldnt get the signature because I cant justify the price. However 17 LEDs seems a bit excessive given that my current paperwhite has 4
1605,I was just wondering how good the new great walls are and how far they have come from a few years ago!   They are a great price and seem to be great for what they are. Especially now the features are great  warranties amazing and they look really cool too.   What do you guys think? Would love to hear your opinion on this!   Thank you so much for reading my post :P
1606,"I was never ""just"" D&D. I played Traveller and Cthulhu as a kid as well. But I would say I didn't leave D&D. D&D  left me. Which is why I prefer Pathfinder.  I've also tinkered with 7th Sea and Dresden Files because I love the settings. I'll never get to play Dresden properly  sadly. It's fun looking game."
1607,"I was never really into D&D in the first place. Used to play it a tiny bit back in high school but the complexity of the rules and the inconsistency of the players made it unmemorable. I've always liked Dragon magazine and TSR's and WotC's work as inspirational but the rules never clicked for me. Then I moved on to GURPS and other games.  But when it was time to pick up the GM screen again a few years ago  Dungeon World and PbtA hit all the right buttons: easy  fast  flexible  flavorful  extensible  fun  modern rules for less prep... and it opened my eyes to a whole world of independent games and indie designers and outlets like Kickstarter and [itch.io](https://itch.io).   DW just grabbed me and became a thing I did with friends  and became the thing for me. We tried other systems  like Lamentations of the Flame Princess  and GURPS  but DW proved the winner because of it's ease of entry  it's flexibility (take any D&D module and you can use it in DW)  and it's ""hack-worthiness"": as part of the OSR scene (sorta)  it has a DIY attitude  and it is open-source licensed so anyone can do anything with the ruleset  even make money using the creators' exact words. Very prescient and generous on Koebel and LaTorra's part  and it opened a new market for people making cool  free  or paid supplements. Or homebrewing new things. Or hacking to the core and making Stonetop or something. I also dig the sorta new-school Powered by the Apocalypse games which have a similar DIY attitude  and they're a refreshing change to (what I consider) the complexity and checkered past and overwhelming industry domination of D&D rules.  These days  I'm pushing my DW group to try *Worlds Without Number* with me. I love Crawford's work  I love the GM help in his books  and I think that I don't need to look at D&D any more except to cannibalize ideas  because WWN is the smoothest  most complete  most flexible translation of OSR/D&D 2e around. Easy to pick up  easy to play  easy to prep for  easy to expand. Got all that fantasy D&D flavor without the weight of the game's legacy (it's got a different kind of Legacy  of course...)  I vote for the RPG underdogs in this case. While I welcome all that D&D does  and has done for the hobby  I just can't bring myself to embrace the rules. I believe that D&D has been an outstanding foundation for the hobby; let's see how we can build on that to make the RPG experience different  show people there are other ways to play."
1608,I was rust proofing the undercarriage of my car this morning and I found that this [sticky gunk was forming on the bottom of the floor pan that feels like thick layer of melted bitumen](https://imgur.com/a/HkE63SC). I don't remember it being sticky last year so I'm wondering if this is something I should be worried about?  * In terms of spills  a bottle of octane booster leaked in the trunk over the summer and seeped into the trunk mat but as far as I can tell  it didn't reach the spare tire well. I also can't imagine that small of a bottle could have cause this much build-up. * Since gasoline is a lubricant and evaporates  I don't think it's a fuel tank leak either. The floor pan caps don't have the sticky residue on them either so I'm even more confused.  If it's a leak but maybe there's something I'm overlooking here?
1609,"I was self taught for a few years then went to university in a software engineering degree. I'd say the biggest disadvantage skill wise would be in design patterns. At least for my self teaching it would usually be feature oriented so I'd search ""how to do {X feature} in {y engine}"" and they do a good job of teaching you exactly that but quite a bad job of how to implement that feature in a larger project or take scalability into consideration. You can learn that stuff yourself though and I'd say it's essential if you want to work in game Dev professionally."
1610,I was so excited for action this week but...not like this.......;-;   At least Fido is back!   This wait game is harder this season cause Shin and Lena are even more farther apart. When we're on Shin's side I miss Lena  when we're on Lena's side  I miss Shin. IT'S EXCRUCIATING.
1611,I was so excited to watch this with my friend  only to have the cat-girl-child-whos-not-really-a-child upfront naked taking a bath right at the start. Does it get worse? I really wanna give this anime a try  but it's making it hard to do so.
1612,I was so happy because Fido is back but the second half of the episode ripped my heart open. Eugene just wanted to show Nina the sea. He just wanted to provide better life for his sister. That's all he wanted.   Pain and death is inevitable  indeed. Now  let's wait for Nina's letter.
1613,I was this way until Sakaguchi released FANTASIAN on Apple Arcade . He made me feel nostalgic and happy. Maybe we are just stuck in the pattern of life of doing the same things over and over again - or maybe we are depressed? I feel you & I didnt even read your whole post. I hope you will truly enjoy gaming again one day and most importantly can be genuinely happy
1614,I was today years old when I first considered the possibility of having rumors that *weren't* at least partly true.  All the rumors in my games lead somewhere. They're all potential plot hooks  or tied to stories or character motivations. I wouldn't put them in if they had nowhere to go  what's the point in having a chekov's gun if you aren't going to fire it? I have just always relied on the party not having the time or resources to follow up every single one  especially since they usually crop up whilst players are investigating and following up on an existing quest  to keep that sense of mystery and fantasy.  The idea of random rumor tables just seems wild to me. Why would you want your players to risk being sidetracked over nothing?
1615,I was told to play this game by my roommate in like  2005  but he moved out before I got the chance.   I've been looking for it off and on ever since.  If anyone has a copy they'd be willing to loan me  or whatever  DM me?  I promise I'll buy it when I can afford it someday...  Edit: Thank you so much  what a great community!!
1616,I was under the impression that audio recorded by a company is only usable with permission. How did he legally use Earthbound soundfonts for Undertale?  Were the specific ones he used public domain to begin with  or am I looking at this the wrong way? I love the idea of including audio elements from my favorite retro games in my own projects  but I'm pretty sure it's illegal. Just wondering how he and so many others have done it.
1617,I was wondering whether I could get a significant performance uplift by using Intel's optimized TensorFlow build ([https://hub.docker.com/r/intel/intel-optimized-tensorflow-avx512](https://hub.docker.com/r/intel/intel-optimized-tensorflow-avx512)). This states it only works with Xeon processors  but you can always try anyway. AI Benchmark ([https://ai-benchmark.com/](https://ai-benchmark.com/)) can run various models for training and inference.  **Did it work?** Yes  I believe it worked.  Maximum core frequency was lower  and the temperature was higher when using the intel AVX-512 optimized container compared to a vanilla TensorFlow container. This leads me to believe it used heavier instructions.  **Results**  I recorded about **24% uplift** in score on the test. I've also tested my RTX 3090 and I'm adding some results from the AI Benchmark website for comparison. The results look reasonable/in-line.  |Model|Inference|Training|AI Score| |:-|:-|:-|:-| |i9 11900f vanilla|1385|1357|2742| |i9 11900f optimized|(+10%) 1518|(**+40%**) 1893|(+24%) 3411| |RTX 3090|22116|22632|44748| |AMD Ryzen 9 3950X|1755|1223|2978| |Intel Core i9-9940X|1750|1512|3262| |Tesla V100 PCIE 32Gb|16530|17865|34394| |GeForce GTX 960|2996|3312|6308|  I was compelled to run an experiment like this out of curiosity for a while. But decided to jump on this after seeing the **horrendous Windows results** on the AI-Benchmark on Anandtech ([https://www.anandtech.com/show/16535/intel-core-i7-11700k-review-blasting-off-with-rocket-lake/4](https://www.anandtech.com/show/16535/intel-core-i7-11700k-review-blasting-off-with-rocket-lake/4)). The Windows results look so bad (for reasons stated in the article)  I'm not sure whether they are reporting the total score or just inference or training.  So  not only does it perform significantly better using the optimized container  but it also performs a lot better on Linux than on Windows.  While setting up this test I came across some information that it might be possible (although not officially supported) to run TensorFlow on the AMD APU's Vega graphics using ROCm  so I might do some digging there and see if I can get it to run on my 5600G.  **Test System**  * PopOS 21.04 (all tests in docker containers / NVidia-docker)    * TF Version: 2.6.0    * AI-Benchmark-v.0.1.2 * i9 11900f (power unlocked  up to 210W) * Z590 Asus Maximus Hero * Noctua NH-D15 * 32GB RAM 4x8 3200/14-14-14-34 B-die * RTX 3090 (Palit)  Edit: Typo
1618,I wasn't enjoying myself  and was getting sick of having to keep track of everything for a party who couldn't be bothered to understand their own character sheets. I ran a game of MotW on a lark for some other friends  had a blast  and never looked back.
1619,I wasn't much of a fantasy fan to begin with so when I discovered a game that wasn't fantasy I jumped right onto it. That game was Twilight 2000. Never did a lot of fantasy after that except for a little bit of BECMI DnD when my players wanted a light hearted game.
1620,I wasnt really that into cars until a bought my first one. It wasnt really something I could relate to that much before  but after I got my first car and started maintaining it I got into it. I guess thats why I still dont care that much about luxury cars. Theyre cool  but because theyre unattainable I just dont care that much.
1621,I watch all Eve Videos and would never steal a motorcycle unless it was a Garland :)  A super computer controls the population into believing it is the 1980's and they are not actually living on a space ship.   Megazone 23
1622,I watched Evangelion and really liked it  I want to see other similar mecha animes  I'm in doubt between Tengen Toppa Gurren Lagann and Gundam. Which is better/ i should watch first?  Wich do you prefer?
1623,I went from a v6 mustang to my abarth  it's smaller in every exterior dimension but immensely more practical  more fun  and gets better fuel economy. Having 2 extra doors doesn't magically make a car bigger and coupe styles are just generally popular.
1624,I went sedan coupe sedan and back coupe in my long line of Accords owned. 1: The coupe in this case was the only way to get the engine/transmission combo I wanted and 2: I came to realize the instances in which I needed the back seat/sedan was very rare and became a poor indicator of actually needing a sedan  so why bother?
1625,I went through weird compulsive years in my early twenties. Doctors told me everything from it being anxiety to it being a virus.  All I know is that time and diversification of my interests and friends made it go away.
1626,I went with my dad to look at an Outback for him a week ago  and while we were there one of the salesman was telling us that he kept hearing through the grapevine of the slim  but nonzero chance that the US would see the Levorg/WRX wagon.   Shame if its gonna be CVT only though. I loved the engine in the Outback Wilderness we test drove  but the CVT really ruins the experience IMO.
1627,I will be glad to refer this great assistance i had from a very reliable source.... I was able to loose everything i worked for all my life..... my ex almost took everything I worked for all my life. I noticed some strange moved and i have to discuss with my friend she really feel bad for me and wanted to assist me  i was referred to a great help ACYBER710 on the gmail  she was amazing and really assist me get in my ex phone and found out how he has been planning to take everything..... This was a really suck to me and i feel really bad after all i did for us..... Gladly i was bale to safe myself from this horrible relationship and thanks i didn't loose any of my stuff
1628,I will not hesitate to recommend either *Risus* or the *WaRP Engine* rules  both of which are free  light  conducive to the creation of weird and wonderful characters  very easy to play  and quite similar to each other. They use small pools of d6  conflicts are over quickly  and their freewheeling nature allows for players and GMs both to stat up and utilize damned near anything they can think of.
1629,"I will rank in order:  1. Mushoku Tensei (So far AOTY and perhaps when its done best since Samurai Champloo) 2. Dragon Maid 2 (distant second but had touching story and great visuals) 3. Re:Zero 2 4. Odd Taxi 5. Attack on Titan (not my cup of tea but you have to recognize its popularity)  It was a small list this year.  To Your Eternity was close but it drug on for me.  But the real story here is how much  better MT is than anything else.  I haven't seen such a drop off between the ""best"" and the ""rest"" in anime since I started watching."
1630,I wish we could get budget Windows on Arm devices with these instead of Qualcomm's shitty old 7c (2020 SD 720G) and 8c (2019 SD 855)  Curious how these Chromebooks will be priced  phones with the Dimensity 1200 are usually only $300-$500
1631,"I wonder if grabbing something like **Pillars of Eternity** or **Pathfinder:Kingmaker** might make diving into classics easier. They have a lot of quality-of-life improvements in comparison to ""old"" classics  but they still retain the core gameplay approach so you don't really need to hit the hard wall of AD&D quite yet. They're also amazing games in their own right and will make diving into better classics like Baldur's Gate I/II much easier."
1632,I wonder if the latter is more common among DMs from pre-3e. I used compass directions a lot more (and also lengths and distances) when my players had to draw out maps themselves. These days I tend more toward POV descriptions although I still occasionally use directions when it seems like it'd be less ambiguous.
1633,I wonder if the pc game developers will continue with their bullshit of asking for stupid high requirements for their games. They will have to stop increasing requirements for a while if they don't want to lose clients cause they can't buy a GPU.
1634,I wonder if the reason the 3 are the only ones in the city is because they broke their oath somehow. Pretty curious to learn just whats going on  there definitely seems to be some kind of big secret the 3 are keeping considering how hard theyre pushing the kid in his training. I think Gus asked him to go easy on Blood because Blood probably wants to die. Gus too. They just cant do it themselves perhaps  they need someone to do it for them.   Maybe Im just reading way too much into things lol.
1635,I work in Toyota parts  what always frustrates me is  some Corollas and Priuses around the mid-2010s getting oil changes.  For whatever reason  Toyota used two different types of oil filters at the same time with seemingly no rhyme or reason.  Usually the VIN number filters it out  but once in a while they dont.  You better hope they have prior service history  otherwise youre harassing the lube techs until they lift the car so you can find out.
1636,I worked many years in data center.   we had to validate every single cable run we did.  it always made me die inside watching the customer start plugging equipment in with dollar store brand patch cables
1637,I would actually suggest you change majors into a more classical degree plan like CS  or Art/animation depending on what you actually want to do  or think you might like doing.  And work on your writing skills.  Written communication is incredibly important in game development.
1638,I would be extremely curious to know if my 2005 Lexus SC 430 is desirable.? I seldom see them for sale and when I do I feel they are a premium price. What do you all think. UpVote for a classic  down vote for shitty car
1639,I would certainly be interested. Last year I started creating maps (from pictures) I call Theater of the Mind Maps and made a couple of videos.  I use JamesRPGart for my CoS game.  Please share...very interested. Thank you.  Some of my videos to get an idea how I use them.  [Theater of the Mind Maps](https://youtu.be/tqKSH0gT-Mc)   [Making Theater of the Mind Maps](https://youtu.be/fjZpUm_IAuw)
1640,I would contact the original authors or publishers and tell them you would like to create a very similar product and ask how you could do that with their product as a base.  They will tell you the terms in which you can do it.  If they send you a Cease and Desist letter  then you know they aren't flexible.   This eliminates all of the future issues.  If they don't want you doing it then you need to change a lot.  If they don't care  then you need to change very little.  I can say that I lived in great fear that the copyright holders of a project that I created would discover what I had done.  They are known for being rather litigious.  One day they contacted me  out of the blue  with a list of changes they would like to see.  I made the changes they asked for.  Then they asked if they could link their site to my work.  We've been happily coexisting since.  Turns out what I had done was something they saw as a tool for selling books.  Everyone is happy.
1641,I would definitely choose a Taycan over a Model S  but the context of the article is important.   The Model S is losing to the Taycan  because Tesla is too preoccupied getting the entry level sedan (Model 3) and crossover segments (Model Y) utterly monopolized. The high-end EV sedan market is being won by Porsche  and that's okay  because it's miniscule by comparison; and Tesla has bigger fish to fry.  Please read the article before jumping to conclusions.
1642,I would establish that cheating is allowed at the table  and that there's no judgment involved in cheating  but that your dream for the game is for people to accept what the dice give them and to realize that the game is going to be more fun if everyone is on the same ride. Basically  make it so there's no reason for this person to be hiding anything from you FIRST  and then collaboratively consent to ground rules.
1643,I would focus on an interesting location. With a cool location all the traveling and action is more interesting. Thinking of a fun scene and build the world around it. Like where anakin and padme are on that giant conveyor belt. Maybe its a factory planet. Underwater is fun too because now you need to think about oxygen and everything can move 3 dimensionally. Also just rip-off a cool movie or comic and reskin it. Girlfriend is captured and brainwashed at a lab/power plant. The team needs to fight and escape (wolverine origins movie)
1644,I would go to fairy tail tenrou island  kill zeref(since conditions did not mention that I need to make sure he is dead  I have killed him once now I have his ability and zeref resurrects)  then go to Goku and kill him  easy peasy  if that doesn't work then go to code geass  steal the geass before second episode and then finish him off by ordering him to die  even if that doesn't work  I will go to mha  kill ago soon after he obtains gis power and then take it  take all other quirks available  then come back and kill Goku  I am pretty sure Goku can't win against this  or final measure  I will go and catch a hoopa unbound and then bring it here  it will spawn legendaries and those will fight against Goku and eventually killing him
1645,I would look into the pro touring scene. People take classic muscle cars and modernize themoften including a complete suspension redesignto the point where they can keep up with today's performance cars on a road course.
1646,I would love to get aftermarket side mirrors with the same prism wedge dimming effect (the tab you push) as my rearview mirror. Click  reach over click  and never bothered by bright headlights at night again.
1647,I would not say anything it if I *suspected* it.  But if someone saw it it would be a totally different thing.  I've had more than my fair share of cheaters and cheating  and my reactions always depend on the specifics of the situation.  What game is being played?  What is the impact on the other players?  Is it affecting the shared experience?    If someone lies on a roll so that their character doesn't die and I'm the only one who notices it?  I'll probably let it slide.  Maybe I'll keep a keener eye on them and give them a dirty look if I see it again.  If someone is continuously and blatantly calling crits before the die stops moving  and then scoops it up before anyone has a chance to see it?  That usually ends with the table agreeing to do rolls out in the open  for Josh to stop using his black on black dice  and to stop rolling on the book on his freaking lap.  And no Josh  you can't use the die roller program that you made yourself because even though you mailed me a copy of the code  when I asked to see the code on your laptop you freaked out and did a really crappy job of convincing me that you didn't just send me a copy that didn't have the little shortcut that always rolls the max number if you long press the roll button...
1648,I would only list 4 RPGs as must-plays:  &#x200B;  Planescape Torment  Arcanum: Of Steamworks and Magick Obscura  Fallout New Vegas  Mass Effect Trilogy  &#x200B;  Each one of them is truly unique and unlike anything else.  &#x200B;  EDIT: Upon some further thought I think DOS2 deserves to be included as well so I'm adding it. Now it's 5.
1649,I would question whether hex bases are that important. Most people playing D&D on a grid for example are using circle bases or no bases  even though D&D is played on a square grid.   If you opt for circle bases that fit inside your hex grid  it'll be easier to move models around as they don't need to line up perfectly inside the grid.
1650,"I would recommend seeing a professional therapist to help you hone in on your specific challenges and tactics for addressing them--both the acute post-game low and the overall depressive tendency.  In general  it can help to make sure you *don't* just sit there and wait for the next thing  but intentionally add a ""next thing"" to your post-game plan.  Definitely stand up and step away from the screen. Do you live with someone you can go have a conversation with? Can you go outside and walk around the block? Can you fold a load of laundry?  Having something to transition to  something not too stimulating  can help you not just be left with a feeling of *nothing* after the game."
1651,"I would recommend starting with some basics.  You are most likely using one of the mainstream game engines. Understanding why a game engine does what it does in the way it does it can help a lot.  Just put a month with no game development aside and read something like ""Game Engine Architecture"". Even if you just brush over it  you can come back to things later if you need to."
1652,I would recommend you to reseat your RAM one by one.  Also try reseating your GPU if the RAM thing doesnt work. But first try with the RAM. Had it happen to me before once  reseating did the trick for me.
1653,I would suggest Little Fears (10th Anniversary Edition) which is available over on Drivethru in pdf. It's pretty rules light and very easy to run. This version is the original edition of the game the later Nightmare Edition is good but the rules are a bit more in depth and crunchy. Basically the game is about kids who stumble into various horror scenarios and have to figure their way out.
1654,I would suggest making a much snappier  shorter trailer that gets to the point much more quickly. As much as it may pain you to hear it  you could probably cut around 30-45 seconds out.   Also  I would advise trying to use Steam's curator connect features as well. It's not the best sort of marketing but it is going to be better than nothing.
1655,I would suggest the Dare which is a call of Cthulhu scenario that includes a great set of simplified rules for playing preteens in the 1980s. Its a great ones shot with some zombie flavor but the rules themselves are totally worth it. Its on DTrpg [here](https://www.drivethrurpg.com/product/220315/The-Dare?term=The+dare)
1656,I wouldn't consider it rare but I do have a car that I have yet to find another one in person. I daily drive it if weather permits and I would've modified it if it wasn't all original with multiple unique options.
1657,"I wouldn't consider the game rules light but I've always enjoyed how fantasy flight d100 games handled firearms. But you could boil it down to something like below.   The Player has an accuracy score for the example let's say it's 30.   Add any modifier from the weapon +10 from a Scope +10 for taking the ""aim"" action.   Subtract the Target's Cover Modifier: -10 for light cover.    To HIT number is 30+10+10-10 = 40 roll a d100 under 40 is a hit over 40 is a miss.   Say the Player Rolls a 35. Congrats they hit! Now reverse that roll to determine hit location 53.  01-09 = Head  10-24 = Secondary Arm  25-44 Primary Arm  45-79 Body  80-89 Left Leg  90=100 Right Leg  &#x200B;  As for hit points  honestly  with firearms and gritty realism  I wouldn't bother.   I'd do something like roll 1d4 on the following table.  6 - Super Dead  5 - Dead  4 - Dying: Dead in 1d4 rounds.   3 - Down  2 - Wounded - Something bad happens to target  can't use arm  lower movement speed for leg shots.   1 - Glancing hit no effect.   &#x200B;  Then have hit locations  weapons  and armor provide modifiers to the above table."
1658,"I wouldn't exactly call it ""desirable"" but it wasn't until after I bought my audi a3 3.2 (for almost nothing) that I learned that it was 1) incredibly rare and 2) extremely similar to the r32  and to think I was considering buying a boring old b7 a4  for reference  in the USA there are 32 golf R32s for sale nationwide. There are only 4 V6 A3s for sale nationwide."
1659,"I wouldn't say ""hard"". It just requires knowledge in multiple areas. But  with engines like unreal or unity  the required knowledge is reduced a lot (instead  requiring knowing unreal/unity  but those are easier for a common developer).  On the other side  web development is pretty *stagnant*  most of the time. Same for classic backends. In the end  you're finding walls again  like you probably did when you started programming"
1660,I... don't have any great suggestions for you  I'm just here to say I'm not super impressed by anything that's already been suggested. All the examples I'm familiar with are the exact opposite of rules-lite.  Maybe try... Mothership? Maybe? I haven't played it  so I don't know how well it handles guns specifically  but I know it has them AND is ultra-gritty and lightweight. Traveller and Stars Without Number are also sci-fi games that... might fit the bill  depending on what you're specifically interested in.
1661,I'd actually say no. It shouldn't be the first one you watch. I really enjoy Bepop and it is a classic  but it entirely depends on the kind of show you like. If you prefer shows that have one long story  then I would not start with this.
1662,Id always liked cars growing up but I didnt truly get into them until grad school when I bought a dirt cheap shitbox E30  literally it was brown which is apparently a rare color and had about everything imaginable in need of maintenance. It also had a carburetor  a computer controlled carburetor  the last carb BMW ever put in a car which gave me endless trouble. Amazingly that car never let me down on a road trip it always waited to break down near home.  Id never really done or had interest in doing car work until I found out how much a brake job cost. Borrowed a set of wrenches from a friend and fell in love. Ended up having to rebuild the head after a stud broke off the air filter housing and it got sucked into a cylinder. So much fun  I really miss that car.
1663,"I'd argue self taught developers are at an advantage because they're willing to experiment  research  and grow their skillset.  How many posts do we see that are the same null reference errors or ""I need a tutorial that does exactly the gameplay system I want down to the last variable""?  I'll take the person who pulled apart every electronic they could and tinkered with the internals over the person with just a formal degree every day."
1664,I'd consider games that have more stream lined D & D style of rules. If I recall correctly  Neverwinter Nights 1 & 2 and Dragon Age: Origins  had an easier version of the D & D ruleset.  And more modern games like Divinity: Original Sin 1 & 2 are probably even easier. I'd like to hear other peoples input though  because I haven't played all of those games  especially recently.  Baldur's Gate 1 & 2  have a super complex and punishing D & D ruleset  if I recall correctly.
1665,"I'd do $1500 for a 32"" 4k 120hz oled.  $4k for 60z?   Nah.  I've actually gotten used to using 55"" oled as a monitor  its not so bad.  Good for gaming and not bad for text.  Blacks make text look crisp  even if dpi isn't super high."
1666,I'd drive it if it was running.  I got a bum clutch kit right before the pandemic and it needs replacing after 250 miles.  I only do reversible reliability mods  cooling  ignition  suspension  lighting.  The only non reliability mod I'd consider is A/C.
1667,I'd learn python to understand basic coding practices and syntax  then mess around with unity and c# in my spare time. At some point you'll realise it really is just syntax  so you will adapt to any language.
1668,I'd like someone excited for Intels GPUs to weigh in because I'm honestly not seeing a good side here aside from *maybe* having a larger supply of GPUs available.   But Nvidia is on Ray Tracing 2.0  with 3.0 likely with the next gen of cards  aswell as DLSS 2.0. In general  they've just got more GPU tech at their disposal. MSRP for a 3080 was $700.  AMD may not be neck and neck with Nvidia when it comes to tech and features  but their cards are at least competitive with raw power and pricing.  Intel is going into this field with  essentially  none-to-little of these extra features and tech things  and will probably have less raw power on their cards while charging higher MSRP.
1669,I'd like to see a study on the actual carbon/ewaste savings on something like this. I kinda doubt that the average persons laptop lifespan is short enough that this is significant. And for the price premium you pay anyway  I don't know if there's an economic argument either.
1670,"I'd love this  enjoyed every minute of the original and the DLC or whatever ""America Nightmare"".  Great games  and good to see Remedy go back to this style of stuff over the Control and... Quantum Break ... ooph.. Style of games. Gimme great story  narrative  voice acting  some action with unique abilities but not ""supernatural"" ones  even if the enemies in Alan Wake were supernatural  his ""ability"" was his flashlight to lower their ""shields"" and then firearms to kill them.  It was excellent"
1671,I'd love to just be a fly on the wall of his workshop for a month. In that month  I'd likely learn so much that it would be life-changing.  Gordon's the reason why I believe every automotive experience should be holistic and tactile and why I'm such a stickler in what level of quality is required for my restorations.
1672,Id love to replace my old surface pro with this beauty  as Microsoft has really refined it over the years and made it into a class of its own. I hope Google can take some lessons from microsoft in hardware design.
1673,Id love to try it. People seem to really praise it sky high ;p Who knows? After RIft/Age of Conan/Aeon and the other 50 MMO like games.. this might be the one? The only bad thing i hear about it is : Its super grindy  Guild Wars 2 is probably the only game that ever managed to replace the you know what popular MMO game (for me ;p) Now i wonder more if there will be Guild Wars 3...
1674,I'd put in some stipulations  I'd discount massively modded cars like ecto 1 or ones with very distinct paint like the general lee as a bone stock version isn't going to have the same instantly recognisable effect. Cars like Bullets mustang kind of fall into this category  its distinctive - but painted another colour it could be the hero car from any number of 60's movies that used the fastback mustang for the protagonist (gone in 60 seconds etc)  whereas a [red DeLorean](https://bringatrailer.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/1982_delorean_dmc-12_15815271508543b60a419aPhoto-Jan-23-11-50-00-AM-1.jpg) is still Marty McFlys ride.   The two others I'd suggest would be the AE86 and Inintial D  or the Ford Anglia and Harry Potter.
1675,I'd recommend https://www.goblincrafted.com  The site has a variety of recommendations for games  organized by genre.  While it does have a mix of both simple and more complex games  you're sure to find some great simple ones if you just browse around a bit.
1676,"I'd say I have one ""collector"" car  that being my 205 GTI. I drive it  but not currently since it's undergoing a bit of a restoration. But I have daily driven it in the past  couple of years ago  and will probably do so for a summer or two again.   I wouldn't mod it  I want it to be as original as possible. We do however have another 205 GTI that's a Group N rally car  so it is lightly modded. Nothing you can't revert back to original though. The roll cage is bolted on  not welded  seats you can obviously change back to the original ones easily as well as the steering wheel  I think the only parts that are ""ruined"" are the left front fender and the bonnet. Former has holes for the main power off switch and the switch to turn on the fire extinguishing system  and the latter has holes for bonnet pins.  My thinking is  for every classic car you mod you gotta have one that's in original condition."
1677,Id say if theyre that petty just let it go. You enjoy the fate of the dice but they enjoy pretending theyre a more powerful character.  As the GM you can give them challenging situations that require more than hit points and stats. Tough decisions about who to save and who to let die etc.  Also  if your party is into it  give them a pool of numbers to distribute among their ability stats. 17 15 13 12 11 for instance. For hit points you could say its fixed based on class.  Just a couple ideas.
1678,I'd say it's more of a question of deciding not to go back. And it's not like I don't play adventuring type games. I have my own osr brew which resembles modern D&D only in that I use some of the same words  though the concepts they point at are rather different. And if I want to play high powered superheros then I'd much rather turn the dial all the way up and play Exalted.  The most recent edition I just find so very  very mild. It's been through the rock tumbler of committee design  and the kitchen sink fantasy means nothing really draws up a sense of wonder. It isn't even bad in an interesting way.
1679,I'd say it's that they just want a coupe and FWD vs RWD is mostly a moot point for most buyers out there. Drivetrain layout doesn't make or break the car necessarily  i.e. I'd take a good FWD car over a bad RWD car.   Plus  FWD is not without its benefits.
1680,I'd say the entire first half of Season 1 is boring for the most part but it picks up later on... So if you have the patience for slow shows that build up into a lot more stuff happening then watch it.
1681,Id say yes. Im not as high on it as others  but its worth giving a shot for certain episodes and music and art alone  even if the underlying central narrative is pretty weak.   Just dont go into it expecting some soaring epic. Its an episodic show that uses its MC as a prism through which to view whichever other characters are taking focus at the time.
1682,Id sign up but it seems like you have to use their launcher and Im over that shit. I just got back into PC gaming when I built my beast during lockdown and the billion different launchers (Epic  EA  Ubisoft  Xbox) was the most frustrating part. I already have GOG  EGS and Steam and Im not getting another one.
1683,I'd start with whatever anime matches your interests. If that's a mostly episodic space western then Cowboy Bebop is probably a safe bet.   Afterwards I'd start just watching some of the really high rated shows regardless of whether or not they perfectly match your interests so that you get an idea of what's out there.   The only thing you might want to consider is the difference between Shounen and Seinen. Shounen typically has more stereotypical anime tropes which can turn a lot of people away from anime  whereas Seinen is going to be a lot more varied and probably more what you're used to. Not to say Shounen is bad  in fact it's the most popular type of anime in the west  but if you don't like Shounen then you should look specifically for Seinen because there is a *lot* of Shounen out there and it can be a little hard to avoid if you aren't aware of it.
1684,"I'd strongly suggest Freeform Universal.  Characters are just a collection of phrases and descriptors  and the only mechanic is the player asking ""Can I [do X]?"" and the dice pool saying Yes or No  And or But.  I love it SO MUCH for playing non-standard genres and settings  because the narrative is everything.  There's no special rules for magic or powers or machine guns or whatever because the ""Can I?"" question fits everything.  It's totally not intimidating for newcomers because we all just tell stories.  There's no rules to learn other than ""When you want to try something cool  phrase it as a question""."
1685,"I'd take this over a manual base M3. Its cheaper  the exhaust sounds better and it looks better.  It is overshadowed by its big brother with that glorious V8 but unlike V6 Camaro's and ecoboost Mustangs  if I ever see one of these I won't be thinking 'should've got the V8!"". Actually I did see one about 6 weeks ago surprisingly here in Canada  must have been one of the initial limited allotments. It had the carbon exterior  canards  the whole deal. No Blackwing badges anywhere  you just had to know what you were looking at  it definitely looked nice parked in the lot.  I'd buy one of these if I wasn't willing to spend the extra 20k-30k for the CT5-V Blackwing."
1686,"Id tell myself not to listen to dad about cars. He knows fuck all and thinks engine oil is a ""I'll get to it sometime within the next 50k miles"" deal. My poor first car was absolutely annihilated under his neglectful eye."
1687,I'd totally use this. I often just use images of scenery pulled of the internet as battlemaps. You need to abstract somethings  often distances  but they have tons of awesome details that players will choose to interact with.   For example  after a 10 second internet search[something like this](https://www.123rf.com/photo_124161135_an-illustration-of-an-abandoned-outpost-in-the-desert-3d-illustration-.html?vti=nzd7ru74ag962v5es1-1-3) (without the watermarks  of course) is an image we would totally rock for an encounter with all kinds of tactical sweetness and 3-D goodness with rooftops and railings to bop guys over  etc.  I could do similar things with what you shared.
1688,Id watch the anime to see it all now  then watch the anime for the episode that shows Rengokus journey to the train (not covered in movie) and then the anime has i think over 70 additional scenes. And also the opening for the Magen Train Arc is fucking great like my god its amazing
1689,Ideally USB C would be great  but the main thing I don't get is why Apple limits their connector to USB 2.0 speeds rather than update it to 3.0 even if the form factor had to still be lightning. USB C with 3.0 speeds is backwards compatible to USB C 2.0  surely they could do the same with the lightning port  no?
1690,Idk about must play  but Dragons Dogma's combat  especially in the bitterblack isle  was some of the most fun I've had in an rpg. If combat is the sole focus of what you're looking for then that's a top 5 rpg. Would put DOS2 in that top 5 too
1691,"Idk if all FF fans are really as cynical as the comments of this sub make it seem  but I just came here to say I've been a fan since the late 90s and FFXV was pretty good  FFVII:R lived up to the hype for me  and the trailer we got for FFXVI looks really promising.   My faves are still in the PSX era to this day  but Idk I think the community needs to start moving past ""the new one is the bad one"" takes. It's not original anymore and new stuff can be good without being the best in the series"
1692,Idk if it helps but just yesterday I was randomly rolling a character with a friend just for fun and we got JOHNNY THE BEAST. Stats were 3 2 5 4 5 6 (yeah  6). Health 6. And starting gear looked like shield+helmet+(brigandine?).   I know this is possible but improbable. So see if all her characters are really good. It certainly can happen twice  but three times... I would bring it up to her then.  Also  as others said. If she is indeed cheating  that's a bummer for her. Knave is pretty deadly  so you all will find out eventually.
1693,Idk why they used the orange color for the reveal  it absolutely looks terrible with the black plastic  but the world rally blue color  which was only just shown today during the Australian wagon reveal  makes the car actually look quite good.  https://www.subaru.com.au/around-the-corner/register-your-interest/wrx
1694,"If a game presents you the option to play as a good or evil guy there should be some drawbacks for both paths  without any path being at advantage. The biggest mistake game developers do is that they give you two paths but one (usually the evil path) is plastered with penalties so it is not fun playing and you are somewhat forced to play the good route. Like in BG1: you could play as an evil guy but it wasnt worth it since you couldnt enter any city without guards one-hitting you. Since you had to travel between cities a lot (for story reasons) it wasnt fun at all. The devs fixed the evil path in BG2  though. But BG1 is a good example how ""evil routes"" should not be done. If the devs include an evil path it should be playable. I often replay games but the good route gets boring after 5 or so playthroughs and its good to have a different route to choose  especially when there are other dialogue options  quests  etc. available."
1695,If by story-heavy you mean cinematic I recommend **Mass Effect** and **Dragon Age: Origins**.   DA:O  actually has a unique combat mechanic in that you can set rules for your NPCs to follow while the rules are sorted by priority. You can even level into that ability which adds more slots for the rules. I wish more RPGs offered something similar.
1696,If I run my lap top (core 7 processor) on turbo mode for 3 days will I burn it out. Im doing a giant layer calculation for QGIS and its going to take that long. This will probably come across as a really stupid question but I am no computer expert.
1697,If I timed my downshifts to between 2300 and 3000 rpms then I could get the DSG in my GTI to smoothly shift into first gear when slowing down. I would use this to launch hard out of traffic circles. Otherwise I would use first for any launches with manual mode and my car would hold first really well if I kept it in sport mode and stayed with at least 30-50% on the throttle.   Must be something new with your car that it ignores first gear.
1698,If I were you I would plug the other 4pin for cpu in. Thats that plug above the ram. I only see a 4 pin connector but it has space for an 8 pin.   Your cpu is tryna boost but its not getting enough power. I assume its a 4th gen cpu. Probably an old i5 Im guessing but like a 4670 or 4770 either way its tryna turbo and without the extra power its failing to reach its boost clock
1699,"If it is part of your overall vision for the game  in terms of narrative or gameplay  do it.  I will say if you use real currency  there is almost no way anyone will buy into it. There are way cheaper ways to get an ""arcade game"" type experience now that don't require a credit card.  But I could see a narrative-based game where you work as a night custodian at a run-down arcade  and use your pay or the change you sweep out from under the machines to play the game. Extra points if you really show the contrast between the dreary  tedious job and the bright flashy game.  But there should be a purpose. If you add it in as a gameplay element  it will have gameplay ramifications  so make sure whatever you're doing is elevating the game in some way and not just detracting from it."
1700,If it was straight up just Halo MP with none of that common-legendary weaponry or looting system that others have id be in full support. Just 100 Spartans on the field and your halo skills to the test.
1701,If it's inquisition  the best spec for the game can be the rogues. Warriors have two specializations that are good  and mages can depend on your play style on how OP it can get. Rogues by far always have some broken abilities late game.
1702,"If it's not required  it's not required. Premium is recommended in most turbocharged vehicles  but most of them will run fine on regular  you just lose a little performance. For example  Ford's Ecoboost 3.5 is perfectly fine on 87.   However  octane is not the only thing you gotta think about  also consider top tier vs the cheap shit. Top tier fuel is much better for your engine  regardless of octane.   Just Google ""top tier fuel brands"" and get the GasBuddy app so you can find out where it's the cheapest."
1703,If nothing else I wanna just say if you don't replace the cat it doesn't reduce the harmful emissions coming from your car and it will do more harm to the environment (if you care about that) plus it will fucking stink and to the point it's likely you or someone else will assume your car is broken
1704,If only it were so simple as just picking colors. Game art gets insanely complicated technically especially when you start doing 3D. Every 3D modelling application has thousands of features to learn. It's like after Michelangelo sculpted David  then he has to make it walking robot out of it. It's orders of magnitude more difficult.
1705,"If people are having all this sex in their v:tm games that's a matter of the players  not the game. It's made very clear in every edition that v:tm vampires do not have sexual desires and that they have to invest blood and effort to *fake* it. There's nothing in the game that requires sexuality and if there were it's not particularly hard to ignore what you don't like about official books and just play the way you want.  Not saying you're wrong to prefer something else  just that the reasoning of v:tm being ""too sexual"" is bewildering to me. I've been playing v:tm since the early 2nd edition and have never included sex in any games I've played or run."
1706,If that's an Asus x54c you need to solder a new connector (at least that's what I had to do. Good thing is that that's a very standard one and is very cheap and pretty easy to solder on the motherboard
1707,If the managers ever need a scab  I would love to get my foot in the door. It's how I started my current job  and now I'm making more than the guy who went to school for it for 4 years. To be fair though  I am a better worker than he is.   Show up early  stay late  be humble about how much money you think you deserve  and be willing to do the shit jobs that everyone else thinks they are above doing because they think their culinary degree actually matters.   Will they dump me without warning? Maybe...Am I easily replaced? Probably...  But as it stands currently I'm getting overtime every week. I don't mind overtime. I am far more interested in putting the hours in than I am with my rate. I don't like feeling like a burden. I don't like getting sent home because my manager is stressing out if I'm worth the payroll. I just want to see how many plates we can put out. How good is the food? How much money did the business make?  Maybe I would feel different if I was working corporate  but I work in a mom and pop restaurant and I want them to make money.   Am I working for less than I'm worth? Probably... but I'm also eating pretty damn well right now. I really like my current job.  Yeah  unions are great. I'm really happy I don't work at a place where I feel like I need one.
1708,If the mods make it better for you  and you plan on holding it for decades  or not selling it  then sure  go ahead.  Whether it is right to drive or mod a collector  it depends on the collector.  For an '87 RX7  the engine is the unique thing.  LS swap it and it's just another pony car.     There were lots of them made though  so as far as driving it  or even modding it a little  it's not like you're the keeper of history  someone else is keeping theirs factory original garage queen.  If they are not  maybe it wasn't worth it.   You have a moderately cool car  so go ahead and enjoy it.  At the end of the day it's just money.  Is it about the experience  or the money for you?  I'm starting to think that modding isn't that good.   The car itself is somewhat of a time capsule.   If you want a fast car  get a 5yo pony car  or an uptrim sedan  it's going to be faster than your 80's sports car.    So what it becomes is an experience of the era  or the time.  It's fast for the 80's.    It doesn't have ABS  it has a manual  the engine has it's unique quirks  etc  that's what makes it fun.  If you remove those quirks  optimize the performance  maybe something is lost.     That however is just me  and I can still appreciate the mods.   It's an interesting question  how fast can you wank el?  You start pushing the bounds of human knowledge  or at least get into some hardcore esoteria  and that earns some respect from me.    Even the LS swap  it'd take some fab  and it's a good chassis with a questionable motor.   The car would be better in many ways with an LS.    It'd depend on the dragon you're chasing.
1709,If the players are understanding you  then use your method.  When I was a young gamer I was more of a 'simulationist' and specificity was important for map makers; these days we're all too lazy to worry about it and nobody even bothers with a map unless the place is especially large or confusing.  Keep in mind  I don't do 'dungeon crawl' style adventures  so any visit to a dungeon is likely to be brief and not require a complex blueprint.
1710,If the super refresh turns out to be true  Lovelace consumer cards will likely be 2023  which would make sense anyways given the current climate. No need to launch next gen any earlier when you're the top dog in performance and sales and can't keep anything on shelves.  Also I cant wait for the new ~~3090~~ 3080 ~~ti~~ super.
1711,If there is the files i.e. a cd rom you can install it onto a freshly wiped computer however you can't roll back to vista. Besides being a cool display price Vista wasn't popular enough for this to be worth much
1712,If theres ever a game that I actually somewhat support having a BR in terms of thinking about enjoyment levels  it would be Halo.  It naturally has a shield system  with somewhat long TTK  meaning theres no discrepancy between killing a player in multiplayer or a BR mode  it feels natural either way (which the same cannot be said for Warzone).  Along with that  it already has a fun  varied  balanced vehicle and weapon sandbox  especially in Infinite (so far)  and Infinites grapple system is *really* fun  and would be a welcome addition to the BR mode.  Force on force training is already a very large part of a Spartans training regimen  so it could even be tied in lore-wise  as a representation of scavenging weapons  vehicles  and fighting behind enemy lines with no support. A battle royale is a good way to represent that.  With the large influx of battle royale games  its hard to think of a game Id believe would work well with it from the start. Halo  however  is one of them if done correctly. I just hope it succeeds.
1713,If they really wanted to get another $60 out of me  they would just make another story that takes place in the map of V. I played this story on PS3  PS4  and PC. Im not doing it again. I understand the cost and work of developing a new one from scratch  but come on. Put some more effort into it than a performance patch.
1714,If they're going to mandate a standard power port  I think I'd rather see it be a power-only port rather than a power-and-data port  for security reasons.  Having data stolen through a port that you thought you were only using for power is bad.  Also once it's power-only  it can be smaller (assuming we're only talking about small low-power devices) and rounder for more convenience.
1715,If they're going to mark up something 1000%  at least make it look premium. The stand and housing look the same as their cheap monitors and the design is completely uninspired.  LG makes beautiful TVs  probably the nicest design I've seen. Why does this monitor cost twice as much  have half the frame rate  and look no different in terms of design than a $500 monitor.
1716,If this is aimed at people who used to drive Integras but now need to have child seats in the back  it may do very very well.  If its aimed at people who would still drive an Integra today they may be in trouble.
1717,"If this means the autonomous tech is a $10 000 optional add-on to the vehicle  that I can avoid having and paying for by simply not getting it  then I'm kind of okay with this.  The software that runs self-driving technology cannot be cheap to maintain  and the last thing I want is automated driving technology using old  outdated  perhaps glitchier-than-necessary software.  Subscriptions to the software updates could help keep that more up to date and potentially safer.  I have to be honest: I don't like the push for automated driving technology much to begin with.  Too technologically advanced  and it will never be universally adapted by all drivers  so it will have to cope with human behavior for the forseeable future.  Too many people are going to be reckless about how much faith they put into it.  I don't know what ""level"" of automation this is  but anything beyond lane keep assist  blind spot monitoring  forward collision alert / avoidance  and adaptive cruise control (maybe even functional down to stop-and-go traffic  but requiring steering input) just seems excessive to me.  I'm certainly not interested in anything beyond that.  So if I were in the market for a Rivian (and at $60k to start I *very* unfortunately am not)  I'd be okay with this if it meant I could shave $10k off the price (or avoid *adding* $10k to the price) to ditch the autonomous tech and stick with much more tried and true driver assists."
1718,If TSMC is delayed  Samsung is absolutely delayed and so will Intel.   ASML can only produce so many EUV machines. HA EUV is also delayed by a year. So Intel will have to make 20A by 2025 with a machine which won't even arrive until 2023 (and not even 10 produced until 2024).
1719,If we ignore the obvious Tips like (Buccs win Super Bowl 2020  Buy GME  Buy Bitcoin etc) and only stay car related it would be  2010. dont get granddads car to place X to start a restauration with friends. (It ended badyl since the car was in pieces   suddenly the 2 guys that were mechanics were no longer in our circle of friends and we had to scrap the whole thing since we couldnt even put it back in storage because it was in endless pieces.  &#x200B;  2019  so before Corona  buy a nice big Van because they will explode in prices in some Months.
1720,if windows was installed in BIOS mode you may need to convert or reinstall it  BIOS boots the first 512 bytes of your hardrive  which loads everything else in a chain  UEFI expects that there would be a special FAT32 partition that would have special files  and EFI boots those files  if windows was installed in bios mode  it probably wrote the loader to the first 512 bytes of the disk and didn't create a necessary partition. so UEFI cannot find files to load and failes miserably ~~just like me~~
1721,If you add funimation to what you have already you'll have a large swath of most airing things.  Crunchyroll and funimation are mergering so they will have a lot of the same stuff.(probably be essentially identical in the near future) funimation is better destination for english dubbed anime.    If you have amazon prime there is some anime there too  but it's not as easy to find.   Anyway hope this helps
1722,If you are launching something newthis holiday (a title  a new experience  whatever it may be)do yourself a favor and:     Make sure you have a plan with your Cloud provider toincrease service limits  conduct pre-warming  and ensure capacity availability. Most times your Product team wont want to share externally your PSU projections  but you should be able to at least give the Cloud provider somewhat of a heads up on region and sizing. No one needs to get ICEd at launch or get stuck with a cold ALB; your players won't be happy.     If in your architecture you are using a service that the Cloud providerrecently released GA have a plan of what to do if you need to turn that service off. Feature flags and chaos engineering tools can really help here. Lotta times the Cloud provider doesnt know the behaviors of its service until IP addresses are hitting it at scale. Your title might be the first time this happens. In the very off chance something weird happens  document it  so that later you can negotiate.     Document a mutually agreed upon communications plan between the shared services teams and the game team.A common failure point is the intersection between shared service (social  marketplace  matchmaking  leaderboard  etc.) and the game. If it goes sideways - what will be your escalation path and how will you communicate (jump on a zoom  shared slack channel  text  etc). Agree on who are the point people from each team for communications and ensure your teams communicate thru those people (so there arent multiple lines  aka confusion).     Lastly  when it all goes wellremember to CELEBRATE. You have made magic happen and its important to mark to the moment  before you gear up to ... Do. It. All. Over. Again. :)
1723,If you are not sure if your game is too big  it is probably too big.  You learn to estimate in managing scope  with experience  so just start making games.  My rule of thumb is that a week of game development will take roughly a month of work for all the polishing and content. So maybe start with a week for your MVP. Finish the game is quickly as possible  you can always add more content and features after your game got a beginning and an end.
1724,If you are not uninstalling Skype or messenger do not give it access it is probably a virus. If you can find the file location drop it in to [Virus Total](http://virustotal.com) and do a full scan.  As long as you don't give it access you should be fine. If Windows defender didn't pick it up and block it instantly you may want to go install [Avast](http://avast.com). The version for home use is free and effective. They self advertise a little but it's not intrusive. I've been using it for 13 years and have seen it block hundreds of viruses. It will instantly notify you with an obnoxious alarm when it finds and blocks a virus.
1725,If you are talking about top speed  you would need plenty of aero rework. Though  with the right amount of power  you could overcome that  too.  But generally you can do anything to any car  if you really want to  and it can come as close as you want to any other car  if you have the money.
1726,"If you can stand old games: **Knights of the Old Republic.** It's a brilliant game with an AD&D system that is surprisingly intuitive (and rarely gets in the way). The joy of the game is the story (which is extremely well written)  but the combat isn't bad and never really gets in the way. This is the appeal - it's a relatively innocuous introduction to the genre with a huge pay off of an incredibly story. Note: every level you can increase a few skills. I highly recommend that you \*always\* upgrade the Persuade skill as much of the good content is revealed through conversation.  **Tower of Time** is a newer game. There's really nothing special about it - the plot doesn't grab you. But combat is just...sensible. It's a good way to explore different tactics in combat and strategies in how develop characters so they are both specialized and work well together. It's good  but play it to learn combat mechanics as the story is rather generic (though again - not bad).  There are better games  but those are among the more accessible in the genre.  Note: Knights of the Old Republic has a camera that's behind the player instead of an isometric view. But - if you zoom out in combat  you'll see that it really is the same thing. The ""Jedi Leap"" attack is more polished and fun to do  but the other games have similar attacks."
1727,If you can stomach a pretty rough translation  Tale of Wuxia is probably one of the best role playing experiences I've had in years. It also helps if you love kung fu and don't need a super serious story (though there's lots of heavier plot elements).
1728,If you care at all about handling youre looking at a custom tube frame chassis which is not worth it imo. Youd be better off engine swapping a newer car that doesnt twist and bend so easily. If you only care about flooring it in a straight line then sure
1729,If you could make it sympathetic enough  to where people felt compelled to protect the animals involved  then probably?   You could also do it subliminally  making all the really bad  gross people have animal pelts and all the good people help animals. Disney does it too  but they usually make the products seem expensive or desirable so it doesnt really work.
1730,If you do want to go through the games  there is an incredible walkthrough on gamefaqs by Haeravon. It is a step-by-step walkthrough which allows you to play your way. Want to run an evil group  it will take you to the best places and NPCs in a progressive fashion. Want to find good loot  it helps with that too.  It is a HUGE walkthrough as the entire manual was transcribed for all classes  stats and spells. There is also a few builds as well.  People here will say that you don't need it  and I STRONGLY disagree  as you can wander into an encounter that will kill your entire party in seconds. I would say  use the walkthrough  especially as it is built with the sequel in mind (you can import/export your main character).  If you do enjoy the game  and you get a better understanding of how the game works  you can experiment with more confidence.
1731,If you don't have a 3D card in your system I would say it isn't worth the time to try to do it.   My suggestion is start saving up for a machine. Run Windows as the tools are designed to operate using that OS.   Or make a 2D game.  Good luck!
1732,If you enjoy romantic comedy and dont mind fanservice  you will love this show. However  if you have by chance seen a trailer  or opening  or something that shows you it was all CG and it turned you off  I would ask you to reconsider and give it a chance.  I am also of the mind that many a times  CG really ruins anime  but not this time  in fact  I would argue the opposite! I cant truly explain it  you have to see it yourself.  To give a brief story synopsis  its basically about a boy who was cursed by a witch that everything he touches will die  including his love  his maid Alice. Youd think it would be somber and a tragedy with that premise  but the show is so wholesome and light in spite of that  for the majority of the time.  Anyways  I just came to say that after listening to the opening a bunch of times  so please  give it a try.
1733,if you get stuck on something  do something else. hell  i started with python and pygame  moved to unity and c#  now im doing WPF with xaml and c#. I've learned so much more than had I just stayed in one place and kept fighting a battle i'd already lost.
1734,If you have a buddy that can help test it in a different rig test the card with their help. And/or try swaping your psu. Sounds like it may either be gpu or psu. Sounds to me like it is the psu but I'm certainly not a professional so take my advice with a grain of salt.
1735,If you have a hard disk drive  either that got messed up from the fall or chances are  the motherboard could have been impacted by it. Or could even be both. Ive seen laptops start slowly dying after getting dropped because of that.
1736,If you have access to a 3DS  Shin Megami Tensei IV is amazing. Turn based  strategic combat  hard for beginners but with a very good tutorial and tons of customization for your main character and your party (formed by demons that can be fused  it's kinda like Pokmon). The story is dark and mature  and has multiple endings depending on your choices. This saga has always had a post apocalyptic modern setting with occultism things (you know  summoning demons and fighting gods).  SMT Nocturne has a remaster on PS4  Switch and Steam and it's also quite good (not as beginner-friendly but easier IMO)  and SMT V is coming next November on Switch  so I recommend you to look for one of them.  And if you want a total change in the RPG genre you've played but with some elements you said you like  Final Fantasy IX is a great choice. Medieval setting  happy at first sight but it has some dark things. Turn based  not very difficult  and not that much customization  but I LOVE the characters. It's on PS1  Steam and I think PS4 and Switch. FFX and VI are also my favorites on the franchise and highly recommended.
1737,If you havent (and can stand some scares) go onto YouTube and watch some gameplay of the PC game Phasmophobia and adapt the games ghost hunting equipment to a fantasy equivalent.  - magical light (light spells or from magical flame) reveals ghostly handprints on surfaces. - have the ghost(s) names written somewhere. If spoken aloud it increases the chance of attack. - Darkvision reveals a faint outline of the ghost (looks like Frodos cloak from LOTR. - salt piles  or salt circles reveal footprints of a ghost walks through them.   Stuff like that.
1738,If you like DnD 3.5E/Pathfinder 1E rules system (along with the option for RTwP) better  then Pathfinder is the obvious choice.  If you like DnD 5E ruleset and pure turn-based tabletop-like experience better  then Solasta is the obvious (and currently only) choice.
1739,If you like Fate  [Bulldogs!](https://www.drivethrurpg.com/product/166518/Bulldogs-Fate-Core-Edition) was always a game I was fond of. You could easily run a Guardians of the Galaxy styled game with it. It'll be more narrative / fiction first with regard to the rules.  For something a little more traditional  [Solar Blades & Cosmic Spells](https://www.drivethrurpg.com/product/260378/Solar-Blades--Cosmic-Spells) is a house favorite for my group. I wouldn't strictly describe it as an OSR game  but it's got that old-school spirit. The rules are incredibly lightweight  with a couple of D20's and D6's being all you'll need. It's also got fantastic GM support by way of a ton of tables to roll on for those times you need help getting your imagination going.
1740,If you like high fantasy stories then I would recommend you to buy it. I played BG without knowing anything about D&D and its system. Be sure to start with easy mode so that you get a feel of the game system. If its too hard/complex you can switch to story mode and if its too easy you can go to medium difficulty. While the first BG is an intoduction to the world  lore and characters the 2nd BG is the one where the story really starts to develop with twists and turns. Some people tend to find BG1 a bit underwhelming because they assume its a complete story while in fact its only the beginning like the first chapters of a book. But if you keep that in mind you will like BG very much. Since its not quite often on sale I would buy it.  And you do not need to read any manual. I didnt and went all right.
1741,"If you like reading I'd give traditional western novels a try. ""The hitchhiker's guide to the Galaxy"" is a good  light  humorous sci-fi series and ""the disc world"" series is the same but for fantasy  (and is better in my opinion) hitchhiker's guide is a sequential series but for  disc world you can jump in anywhere  but there's a few bits that work better if you start from the beginning."
1742,If you like scifi and cowboy stories  sure watch it as your first anime.  I myself didn't care for the first episode of CB  but liked it a lot more afterwards.  The thing about anime is that it has as many genres as live action movies and shows do  so a good start would be watching something from a genre you already enjoy.
1743,If you liked Persona 2  what about 3  4 and 5?  While newer  and on Switch  the Xenoblades are pretty good. Though I guess yeah  not in the era you want  but something to consider?  Tales of the World for PSP is pretty fun. If you liked Phantasy Star 4  you may enjoy Phantasy Star Portable (2 is the better one)  though they are action RPG and not turn based if it matters.  Star Wars: Knights of the Old Republic is getting a remaster 'sometime sooner or later' for something to look at.   You can never go wrong with Chrono Trigger. At all. Yum yum.  Suikoden  especially 1 and 2.
1744,If you need a job right now  unity is probably a good way to go  if you have a few years  use what you enjoy  there will be more godot jobs in the future.  When I was learning blender/unity  it was impossible to get a job. Now all my best paying contracts are for blender  and all of my full time jobs have been in unity   (If you plan to get a AAA job  dont worry about the engine  just make good projects. Most AAA companies have their own systems that theyll train you on)
1745,If you think that's good  wait until you get to get to the Creating Adventures section starting on page 222. It's basically full of this kind of thing.  The WWN GMing advice is way better than the GMing section in most games  not only for running WWN but games in general.
1746,If you try and force yourself to play games you have no interest in  you will not only waste your time but take the fun and escape out of gaming.  Time is limited  spend it enjoying what you do on your downtime friend.
1747,If you want a few examples of games that have been abandoned  then see below:  https://store.steampowered.com/app/715410/Signs_Of_Darkness/ (1300+ days without update)  https://store.steampowered.com/app/682290/Zeus_Battlegrounds/ (1000+ days without update)  https://store.steampowered.com/app/659220/PROJECT_MAZE/ (850+ days without update)  https://store.steampowered.com/app/436560/Kings_and_Heroes/ (1300+ days without update)  https://store.steampowered.com/app/360680/Drone_Zero_Gravity/ (1600+ days without update  was purchasable but then abandoned)  https://store.steampowered.com/app/626200/Dead_Alliance/ (1500+ days without update  released extremely early in EA)
1748,If you want a JRPG  try the Breath of Fire series. If you want something western  try the Shadowrun games. There's two old ones  one for the SNES and the other for Mega Drive  but I'm talking about the one's released recently  although the old ones are great too (beware the Mega Drive one  it's hard).  I'm currently playing Arcanum  which's a game from the guys that made the first Fallout games and that would later make the excelent Vampire: The Masquerade-Bloodlines  and I'm having a blast. It's got that old style of the Baldur's Gate engine  but I feel it's much better tailored and balanced  so you could give it a try. The only thing you should know before trying it is that you MUST play it on Turn-Based mode  so you just look it up on the options menu... or just press the spacebar while in combat. Apart from that  the game has an unofficial patch you can download that gets rid of bugs and adapts the game for modern standards  while it can also unlock some content that wasn't available in-game  but was there in the files.
1749,If you want something on your phone  while it isnt really an RPG  I play Dokkan Battle a lot doing this kind of thing. Its a f2p gacha game based on Dragon Ball but its pretty f2p friendly. Lots of the earnable units you can get for free from event stages are good enough to pretty much clear 98% of the content if you can stomach the grind for some of them.     EDIT: and it doesnt require very much attention unless you're on a really difficult stage
1750,If you want stuff made by the same creator as Akira  I would recommend the films Memories  Robot Carnival  and Neo Tokyo. They're all anthologies of short anime films that include segments made by the creator of Akira.
1751,If you want to build a K20 Honda  the Civics and Integras of the same time came with them but in a smaller and lighter chassis. If you want a sedan the Accord is generally overshadowed by the likes of WRXs and Evos  being NA and FWD vs turbo and AWD. Plus they only sold them in a few countries so they don't get much attention internationally.  They're good cars and are a bit slept on IMO  I had one of the older gens (CL1) and loved it  but there is a reason for it.
1752,If you want to dip your toes into the Fire Emblem series I'd recommend you start at the beginning. There is a remake of the first FE game on the Nintendo DS named Shadow Dragon. And FE Shadows of Valentia for the 3DS is a remake of the second game.  Gameplaywise they are much more barebone than Awakening  but in your case that might be a good thing.
1753,If you want to drive it drive it. If you want to make money sell it and invest the proceeds. If you like looking at it but dont want to drive it and dont care how much fun and money youre losing by doing that keep it in the garage.  Personally I would drive it as long as its modern enough where you arent worried about dying. I specifically avoid buying cars with delivery miles because I have no intention of watching them sit. If your car already has miles on it its too late for the pristine examples only crowd anyway so you might as well enjoy it. I would definitely keep the mods reversible personally.
1754,If you watch dubs  then watch the movie. The dub won't be out for a bit. otherwise  I would say watch the TV series. It's going to include 70 extra scenes.   Unless you're a fan of demon slayer. Then watch both.
1755,If your car is burning a liter  not quart  of oil every 2k kilometers you have a massive problem thats probably not worth keeping the car. If its quarts then its still a really big problem and needs fixed or replaced.
1756,If your evap canister and other evap system parts havent been damaged from someone overfilling the tank then I recommend trying to angle the nozzle so it isnt touching the walls of the fuel filler hose. I do this with my R33 and it prevents fuel splashing from triggering the shutoff prematurely.
1757,If your reduced shader is only doing a copy that makes me wonder if your performance is bus bandwidth limited. i.e. the GPU may just be sitting there doing nothing for most of the time.  If that's the case  one approach to optimization might be breaking the operation into smaller chunks that can be uploaded and processed separately  this way the GPU can be working while other chunks are transferring across the bus.  Apologies if this is off base  it's been a little while since I've done this sort of optimization.
1758,If your struggle is not having enough time I would stay _far_ away from devlogs. As you said  they're a lot of work and use completely different skills than actually making the game in the first place. If you've already got a following interested in you as a developer and you're trying to keep them hooked between games then they have a purpose  but there are way more efficient ways of marketing and _way_ easier ways of holding yourself accountable to a schedule.  If you enjoy making them then go for it  but I'd keep the videos as direct and to the point as possible. I didn't personally make it through twenty seconds of intro and making coffee. If you're making a devlog have a thesis for the video and make it clear. A novel way of programming something  an interesting development  a perspective you can share that will help people. A general update isn't interesting to anyone who doesn't already know you. Start with the gameplay that will make me care about your game - and if you don't have that gameplay yet  it's probably too early to be thinking about any kind of promotion.
1759,If you're comfortable with D&D and how it plays  take a look at [Spycraft 2.0](https://www.drivethrurpg.com/product/12001/Spycraft-20-Rulebook--Second-Printing). It's very comprehensive and well-supported.
1760,If you're familiar with D&D 5e  there is a variation on the rules for spy games called  simply enough  The Spy Game.  https://www.drivethrurpg.com/product/332115/The-Spy-Game-Core-Rulebook  There's a free quickstart if you want to get an idea of what it's like.  https://www.drivethrurpg.com/product/278422/The-Spy-Game-Quickstart
1761,If you're familiar with somewhat 'basic' OSR mechanics  [Beyond the Wall](https://www.flatlandgames.com/btw/) with it's playbooks is an awesome one shot system. Everyone picks a playbook  rolls a few things in that playbook  and BAM  they're ready to play.  Last month we ran [The Fools who Follow](https://zadmar.itch.io/the-fools-who-follow). Which a few small tweaks  this was also a blast.  [Electric Bastionland](https://www.modiphius.net/collections/electric-bastionland#) / Into the Odd are also really light and good for a brutal one shoot.  [Havoc Brigade](https://gshowitt.itch.io/havoc-brigade) is a lot of stupid fun  especially if you get the Warhammer references.
1762,If you're going to group fates together I believe the radiant duo ought to have been together.    Also I'd have preferred an official gothw or even thracia over any of them.  Edit. Voted path of radiance
1763,If you're good at them  any souls game will do the trick. They're my go to when multitasking.   If it's your first time playing them  then probably not  but they are excellent zone out games when you know what you're doing.
1764,If you're interested in decision making  CRPGs are a pretty safe bet. Try something like **Tyranny**  or **Disco Elysium** if you don't mind the absence of combat. They're easier games that'll nicely introduce you to the genre before you play games like the OG Fallouts and Arcanum.   Morrowind is a CRPG but is themed more around exploration than choice and consequence  which sounds like what you're after.
1765,If youre liking that one  just wait till Wrath of the Righteous hits consoles.  Its more of the same stuff  but better.  Better story  cleaned up mechanics  a very new path system  more classes  etc.  They very much took what they learned from Kingmaker and built upon it.
1766,If you're talking about becoming a typical game logic programmer  there's not really a huge difference. While game logic can get very technical and mathematical in nature  most of it is stuff you can learn as you go by Googling for how to do the specific thing you want to do.  &#x200B;  Where I think formal education would help more is in building more custom systems. It doesn't take much to learn how to program a game using C# in Unity or Blueprints in Unreal  for example  but if you want to develop your own 3D game engine  MMO  monetization framework  server management  commercial engine plug-ins  terrain destruction algorithms  etc.  those demand not just technical knowledge of specific technologies (which realistically can be learned solo) but also just general intuition and knowledge about how large software is built and deployed  which tends to come from experience. Industry experience will actually be much more valuable than formal education in this regard  but formal education is the most common pathway to that industry experience. Developing large  complex systems is the sort of thing you pick up over many years of industry experience  so it's not really a bare minimum game development task that someone making their first 2D indie really needs. In fact  building your first games can be a means of building up much of that experience and expanding one's horizons.
1767,If you're talking about those cars  nearly any engine upgrade is possible by throwing a bunch of money at it. You could have the 1987 Mustang upgraded by swapping in a newer GT500 engine or something like that. The Corvette could just be swapping in a newer engine from GM and supercharging it. I think some of the [Ring Brothers cars](https://www.ringbrothers.com/gallery) might be of interest  and may even help inspire you. All of this said  I'm sure there are folks on here that could tell you what sort of engine swaps and modifications are actually common for those cars.  Edit: What's the story about? I'd be interested in a story that revolves around heavy modifications to classic cars.
1768,If you're willing to play over Discord  there's a whole wealth of other games available to play. Just join the official/pseudo-official discord server for the game you want to play and check their LFG channel. I've had mixed results but with enough time and effort you'll find a good group eventually!
1769,If you're working on balance and stuff don't worry about getting it right.  Give yourself creatures with a range of HP and see what works and what doesn't. You're going to need to play test this thing anyways.
1770,If you've got the right (wrong?) sort of group you won't need to do any of that. Just make sure that their first impression of the cult leader  and by extension the cult  is a negative one. He talks down to them  or criticizes them  or accidentally walks off with something belonging to them.  See  a certain type of player tends to get stuck with their first impression of an NPC  even if later evidence would seem to contradict it.  The corollary to this is that as a GM you can't really predict how players will react to your NPCs  so you might have to cycle through NPCs to find one the PCs dislike/hate  then retroactively make them the cult leader.
1771,If you've played the most recent Star Wars system  the generic version (**Genesys**) has a book for the Android  setting called Shadow of the Beanstalk that does grounded  chromed out cyberpunk very well.
1772,"Igarashi: ""There's nothing going on with Senpai and me aside of the usual relationship between a Senpai and Kohai""  Yuu from Bloom into You: ""So your senpai fell for you because you can't fall for anyone?""  Igarashi: ""What?  is that a thing?""  Sakuta from Bunny Girl Senpai: ""Or you saw your senpai in bunny costume because no one else saw him  then you fell for him""  Igarashi: ""What  senpai in a bunny costume? Gross... Well  maybe it would be funny...""  Uzaki-chan: ""Maybe you saw him alone doing boring stuff so you went to bother him in order to be more fun?""  Igarashi: ""No  my senpai is not boring  if anything he should tone it down a little""  Nagatoro: ""I think she saw him really vulnerable and proceeded to tease the hell out of him""  Igarashi: ""HE IS THE ONE WHO TEASES ME""  Kohai-chan from Tawawa: ""He teases you? My senpai is always so serious  but he looks after me a lot  I even play with his cat""  Igarashi: ""I think there's 2 reasons for that you tiddy monster""..."
1773,IIRC  the enhanced editions have a story mode or something like that which is basically god mode from what I understand (all stats maxed  can't die) so there's always that to fall back on.  As you mentioned  they are old games so there's a lot of info out there (i.e. youtube  different forums - I found Something Awful had a nice thread dedicated to the IE games like Baldur's Gate  GameFAQs has some decent guides - DSimpson wrote some nice guides for the original BG that will give you a basic understanding of the rules).  There are lots of ways to break the game (i.e. sleep is very powerful for like the first half of BG 1  ranged dominates BG 1  spellcasters are dominant in BG 2 once you know what spells to use - and again  there are plenty of resources out there to help.  For instance  you can look up Davaeron's spell guide to get an idea of what spells to look for (he plays modded on the hardest settings  but it should be mostly fine for easier/non-modded games).  I got into the series as a kid with no real understanding of D & D or the rules and I did... okay (I managed to beat the game even if it wasn't easy).
1774,I'll be honest  the return of Fido had me ugly crying. I had to put down my dog this morning after 15 years and seeing Shin's dog return really brought back all of the memories I made with my dog and the fact that I'll never make new ones with her again.  I'm not looking for sympathy or hunting for upvotes  but I just needed to mention it to someone
1775,Ill chime in here. Most Alfas and Lancias. My personal favorites are Range Rover Classics. Great looking truck  but you have to go through a lot of pain and money to make it a proper car nowadays. That aluminum Buick engine is just so shit
1776,I'll take a leap and also suggest Assassins Creed Valhalla. It has barely anything to do with the old AC games  but took a lot of inspiration from Witcher and other modern RPGs. You have quite many choices to make as well  including some that will influence the ending of the game.
1777,I'm 52 and I play RPGs (specially JRPGs) more than I did in my youth. I do enjoy JRPGs now more than back then when I even used to dismiss them as 'for teens' because of the spiky hair and 16-old-protagonists  but I find I enjoy them a lot now for some reason  much more than playing the gun-toting commando used so much in western RPGs.
1778,Im a bad person and generally dont enjoy female main characters because Im bad and as a male sometimes they do stuff and to be it just like what the heck why these females doing that thats disgusting then I stop watching but then again Im a bad person so hate on me I did like bofuri I think it was called something about not wanting to be hurt so they just have really good defense that was good
1779,I'm a big fan of Pathfinder....2nd Edition. The 1E ruleset is...cumbersome. And sadly Kingmaker is 1E so the ruleset/gamemechanics drag it down for me. BUT. That said. I still played hours and hours and hours and hours of KM and own it both on my Xbox One and Steam and have a bunch of fun with the kingdom mode.  Hell if it was just kingdom mode  I'd have been super happy with that.
1780,Im a bit confused  my computer blew up half a year ago and havent replaced it since but been keeping my eyes on laptops.  Isnt this a decent mid-range specd rig? Id say its seemingly like a posable thin laptop that can handle gaming on medium settings. Or is there something that im missing here?  Im not quite sure what people are comparing this to so that its getting more of a leaning into the thumbs-down response.  Im looking to get something for photo and video editing with light gaming on the side (Windows) - I felt this was perfect for that. Is there better alternatives out there that can achieve the same sort of pen + portability like this one can? I felt it was Kind of an in-between between tablet  laptop  desktop and I was excited for the release  but now Im a bit confused as to what others can see in it thats a bit disappointing.   Someone help me make sense of it! :P
1781,I'm a C# developer who is currently getting into web development because of market changes and let me tell you: you **are** a failure.  Now  I don't want to put you down or anything  but the amount of bad practices allowed in web is staggering. I would have been fired trice over if I had delivered such code in my company. Then there is that just-use-package-x instead of actually understanding an issue is breeding such ignorance in that community. I met people who don't understand what an anonym method is  or why types-strict languages are useful.  Game development can be hard even for me  but without good programming practice and understanding it'll be doubly hard for you.  It's not your fault. Web is just a terrible way to learn programming. You were set up to fail (in this endeavour) from the start.   You're in for a real uphill battle. I would recommend to either start developing games in a Web-environment to stay in a familiar environment  or really go back to the roots and learn the basics again.  PS: I would recommend using Unity with C#  or even simpler editors. Don't try going from web to C++ and OpenGL.
1782,I'm a C++/C# developer and I'm working for a game company  my 2nd one. I've learned so many different frameworks over the years  it seems to take about six months to get anywhere - and that's not a game engine!  Both game companies I've worked for have large teams. Previously I was working in audio - both the tools and the runtime. Now I'm just doing tools. I'm learning Blazor for the web based apps  gRPC for a test engine. What I do seems to be a long way from the game but it does help designers etc get assets into the game.  Whenever I join a new company I reckon it takes me a year to become useful. The last job was CAD  I was there for four years. I only left because a friend suggested I get for this games job  I thought I had no chance but I made it.  I learned how to use Godot as my favourite game engine. I tried an asteroids based game and struggled to get the AI of the enemy ships to work. Keep plugging away at it  you'll get there.  Recently I worked out how to create a piano roll in WPF - my other interest is in writing music apps and that was a huge breakthrough  even though I'm very familiar with WPF.
1783,Im a Covid tracer and my new position uses Microsoft based programs- need more power! I have a budget of $1500. Whats a good laptop to buy that can do remote work fast  handle lots of data and maybe some Minecraft w/ the nieces & nephews?
1784,Im a former web developer who did game dev as a hobby for a long time and Im now trying to make something of it.  Its a different kind of system but if youve been doing Webdev work (js? react?) you definitely have the technical skill to do game dev  its just a matter of wrapping your head around the paradigm. Just as a web dev newbie might not understand the dom or style sheets or hooks at first glance  it takes specialized knowledge to learn the particulars of how your engine organizes itself.   Your skill at programming  at debugging  at planning  and at organizing code will all transfer to game dev  its just a matter of learning how things are done around here. You can do it if you stick with it
1785,Im a GM of Warhammer 4e and im about to begin the third campaign for my players that are now on the third carrer. One of the player have gained a mushroom parasite that try to gain control of the body and manifest as a humanoid mushroom that only he can see. He asked me for help on how to roleplay that. Now i dont really know so if you have some suggestions its really appreciate.
1786,I'm a huge fan of Feng Shui. Second Edition makes character creation trivial so everyone can get to the butt kicking faster. You can also create a fun evening without digging too much into the setting.  The dice mechanic requires 3d6 at most and shouldn't take long to get the hang of.  Even if your players don't know much about Hong Kong Action movies  they've probably seen some action movies to get an idea of fun actions to take.  Or play Paranoia.
1787,I'm a tad biased and this car isn't the newest  but I think the Mazda RX-8 is quite well designed given its constraints.   They basically made a subcompact rwd sedan and somehow managed to get it to look like a proper sports coupe. The side window profile is really nice IMO. I think it looks better now than in back of the day as the tall doors are more reminiscent of modern cars than those of its era. The body lines are pretty simple so it ties with the trend of simplicity that's going on now into the 2020s.  To me  with some good aero (e.g. the r3 model  Mazdaspeed kit  or aftermarket ones) the design really comes to life. The [Leg Sport RX-8](http://imgur.com/gallery/bYIdji8) updated the bumper with modern Mazda cues and barring some of the tuner accoutrements  to me looks like something that could be sold on a Mazda showroom today.
1788,I'm a very sentimental guy. I got my first jeep in highschool. Lots of memories there. First kiss  first (you know)  late night beach time  camping  etc. God it was so hard to trade it in  but it was 15 years old and had a few hundred thousand miles on it. I had a pretty steady career that required a lot of driving  so I had to get something more comfortable than it.   I love my new car but I still miss my first jeep. Due to the cosmetic damage I'm sure they had her crushed. :( So I take solace knowing I drove her for he golden years.   The newest car I've added to the family is a dream car  so it kind of fills the hole a little bit  and as time goes on  I've created plenty of new and good memories in my other cars. But the Jeep will always have a special place in my heart.
1789,im about 18 and ive ad this happen sevral times before . the best way is to just do something diffrent for a while like engage in a dailyworkout and readd some books that you might have or that you dont have that you never checked out and if you already have any other hobbies enage in them a bit. for everyone it diffrent but it happens on feeling burnout on anything i got burnt out on going for outdoorruns for a bit because at the start of the pandimic for about 4 mounths i ran around 8 to 10k per day for 6 to 7 days a week and after a while i had no diser to run that much so its just best keep your hobbies to an equal amount of time to each other whih is still a pretty tough thing to do but that would be the ideal way.
1790,I'm actually glad  the arguments for a speed limit were pretty bad. One of them was that it higher environmental impact because of more c02 released from cars driving at higher speeds. Germany us going to go fully 0 emissions and that argument won't stand when ev's are on the road.  Another was that it has a higher safety concern  it'd Germany so I wouldn't be worried  you need to be very good at driving to get a license and most people understand their limits when driving fast. Also most the arguments were from people who don't drive and just people who take public transit that was kinda unfair.
1791,I'm also curious to see the answers to this question.   I've been rolling out private beta keys to my Discord followers and of course sending keys to closest friends.  What I've seen happen though is some people just want to try a game for free but aren't really going to give much feedback.  I guess that also depends on how much they like the game.    I've had decent success with an in-game feedback system that creates a Trello post which eliminates the need to leave the game for a quick comment.
1792,"I'm also gonna recommend Space Aces: The New Guidebook. Tons of tables for whacky monsters  gizmos  ships  mechs  planets  missions  pets  etc. The rules are super simple  only 4 pages i think  maybe 6  the rest is random tables. It can even be played GMless or solo  the game has a built in oracle and with all the tables it can be pretty fun to collaboratively figure out how the results take place in your setting.   There is a character creation page called ""Backstory Baloney"" where  based on rolls  you could start the game with a ship  mech  gizmo  pet  injuries  debts to factions  a rival  all with interesting stories behind them.  The game also directly references Hitchikers Guide as an inspiration"
1793,I'm also wondering what other reasons that the car was originally intended for limited production other than compliant with the rally racing rules. Do you guys know/guess if Toyota actually makes money from selling these cars? or it's just not worth its tiny margin? I guess they also didn't expect it to be this popular.
1794,I'm always a sucker for Bethesda games  despite their drawbacks. I don't even know how much time I have spent playing  replaying  install and uninstall the Elder Scroll and Fallout series. Huge thanks to all the modders out there making the games amazing till this day.  And I agree with Borderlands too  I enjoy all 3 series although BL 2 is still the best one yet imo.
1795,Im an actual and current dealer tech. I work on high line cars so our warranty process is a little bit different than normal cars. For us  the manufacturer has more control over diagnostic info and repairs  so essentially all repairs have to be approved up front instead of doing it and then submitting a claim after (like minor procedures at a doctors office).  Generally  if we cant replicate the concern and you dont have a good way to duplicate it  we wont spend hours trying to replicate it. We are paid by the billable labor and for many brands diagnostic time is NOT billable (my brand pays diag).  Past that  some jobs sucks to do  so shitty techs will just say Sorry  cant replicate. or Sorry  not warranty because they dont want to do a job that doesnt pay well. Generally this is a sign of bad management at a dealership  because in this industry you have to take the bad with the good. Management should bring the hammer down on those techs  but often management is also short sighted and sucks. This is what separates a good dealership from a bad one.   There are actual issues with abuse/modifications causing work to be declined. Engine replacements  transmissions  other big ticket items usually require direct and up front approval from the manufacturer (usually via their TechLine). If the manufacturer doesnt want to pay for something  most techs are not willing to fight for it to get approved. Again  a good dealership that has a good relationship with the factory will be able to grease wheels and slide things through.   As far as warranty work and pay  warranty work keeps the lights on. Generally every tech would rather have customer pay work since it usually pays better and is less stress (less documentation required since you dont need to submit a claim).  Overall  the auto industry is run much like medical billing. Difference is nurses/staff get paid salary while the office manages claims/getting paid. Techs are generally ONLY paid by the billable labor and thus are often salty about having their time wasted.
1796,I'm annoyed they didn't update the hardware at all.   I was hoping we might see a new ARM compute SoC (an SQ3  or something else?). Actually the complete lack of hardware changes might indicate something is in the works  but got delayed.
1797,"I'm autistic and I experience this exact same thing.  I don't find it is because of the friendship or comradery from the players but because I create a realistic world for the players to play in and I enjoy having them explore the world I've created.  When the game ends  and worse when a campaign ends  I have to say goodbye to this living breathing world that I've created and all of the characters in the world.  I've learned to move past it now  but early on I found it hard to let go of that amazing world I've created.  It also helped when I found out I was autistic because that helped me understand why things happen the way they do.  Many autistic people have very active imaginations and the ability to create these types of constructs.  Oddly  that makes me a really great GM.  As one player put it  ""How do you come up with this stuff?"" or ""I wish I was able to run a game like you do.""  Of course  I don't think anyone of them would be willing to become autistic to do it.  So yes  I suffer from what you are talking about it  but I've come up with ways to lessen the impact on me through coping mechanisms."
1798,I'm confused at the reduction in latency  especially for writes. Is there some specific reason why PCIE 5 should reduce latency that much? I thought the latency was primarily a limitation of flash memory itself.  Isn't this near optane latency?
1799,"I'm confused. By ""Divinity 1"" do you mean Divine Divinity  and by ""Divinity 2"" do you mean Beyond Divinity  or do you mean Divinity II: Ego Draconis? Or are you talking about Divinity: Original Sin 1 and 2?  These are all very different games with different requirements."
1800,Im context too. The car I let go I had from the day I had my license. 14 years late it was a 650rwhp weapon. Damn I want it back now haha. I built it myself. A lot of blood sweat and tears. And a lot of swearing and cussing at it. I punched it a few times. It was love haha
1801,I'm creating a tabletop rpg based on the Esoterrorist and Call of Cthulhu systems and I'm going to run it for 3 people.  However  I'm a novice master  and I don't know how much life to put into my monsters I've created.  I'm afraid to make it too easy or too hard.  Anyone who can help me  I appreciate it!
1802,"I'm curious what people consider ""compact car"" because according to google it's gained a couple of inches but is still under 180"" (179""). GTI 169  Corolla 172  Mazda3 175.6. So if we pass 180""  is that no longer a compact car? EPA says 187"" is the longest  but at that point do you think your new generation has grown too big for it's section  from a livability standpoint?   More interior is nice  but as someone who likes smaller cars I feel like eventually all these currently classified compact cars will get too large for that."
1803,Im currently about 70% through reading Vol. 2 of the LN and I hope to finish it by the next couple of days. I continue to be impressed by the anime adaptation. The underground city was the first real action scene so I was excited to see how it would look in animated form. And man  I was anticipating that gambling scene too because it was so hilarious when I read it and it didnt disappoint!  Also  Im so happy to see so many characters I recognize from the LN in that ED  and the song is great too!  I still have my reservations about Maki Kawases voice for Will though. It still sounds a bit too feminine for my taste though I hope she gets better as the show goes on.  On a side note  the LN author  Kanata Yanagino is such a cool guy on Twitter! [He personally helps to translate the mini voice dramas in multiple languages after each episode!](https://twitter.com/yanaginokanata/status/1449389235727847430)
1804,I'm currently looking for a 240hz 1080p 23.5-25 inch and IPS Panel monitor. I can't seem to choose one so recommend the best one out there. I'm not fond of 1440p 27inch monitors so do help me choose between the categories below.
1805,I'm currently running a 5e game  and let me tell you  I'm tired of it. It is so fiddly. There's a million little rules  and they all have exceptions  and yet you still have to invent how they apply in each individual circumstance. It's really cumbersome.  Once this campaign is over  IDK if I'll ever DM this game again. So unwieldy. I might still play it  but not DM.  I haven't DMed other systems yet  but I have a shelf full of them and I'm buying more all the time. There's several I'm eager to try. All of them simpler than 5e.
1806,I'm currently running a pathfinder game where the players are part of the city guard and figuring out an overarching mystery. I thought it would be a really fun idea to have an online corkboard they can use to discuss their thoughts  put up potential suspects  etc.  I understand there's a bunch of online organizational board tools but I specifically want one that looks like a cork board and has red twine.  Anyone try this before or have any suggestions?
1807,Im exactly who youre talking about I have 2dr civic coupe 2011  I just like how it looks personally and have no need for a sedan  infact I enjoy the compactness of the car  it works really well for me personally. Im guessing other folks who like small cars are in the same boat
1808,I'm expecting the Zen3D line to be sold alongside the existing Zen3s  as a premium line.  I rather expect that these will (at least initially) be the QC rejects from the new Epyc line which does have V-cache.  The ones that don't meet power requirements will be repurposed as Zen3+ and sold at a honking price premium to give AMD some kind of an answer to Alder Lake before Zen4 launches next year.  I rather suspect that they will initially only be 5900/5950 varients  as AMD can charge the most for these and they're the ones that will benefit the most from them.  As TSMC free up more 7nm space  AMD might increase production of them.
1809,I'm fairly new to the genre. throughout the years I used to be action/sim player however Fallout NV became my entry to the RPG genre (all time favorite game as well) then I tried TES titles (cus yknow bethesda) but didn't really enjoy them. never paid attention to isometric/top down view games but I noticed that literally everyone on forums/fb were praising the late 90's titles (BG IWD Fallout etc) along with modern ones (POE Disco DivinityOS) I got a potato laptop so decided to give it a try. list of the crpgs that I played:  *  Underrail  Wasteland 2  Pillars of eternity  IWDEE  Atom RPG  Fallout 1   and I'm facing the same issue with nearly all of them: (excluding  Atom cus I totally hated it even tho I finished it)   1. at first I'm fascinated everything seems mysterious and interesting 2. spending excessive amount of time in game 3. combat gets repetitive and I'm realizing that game isn't as deep as I thought  4. it's about to end I'm bored and exhausted nearly lost the track of story either gonna abandon the playthrough or force myself to fight that boring final boss   So I'm confused whether I picked wrong titles (for my taste) or CRPG genre is not for me in general. if anyone has faced the same issues maybe give me an advise how to handle fatigue better or maybe suggest me another titles to play which you think is better designed than those I stated above. Thanks!
1810,I'm far from an expert on the autobahn but here are a few of my observations after driving 400 miles on the autobahn  1. Nice well maintained roads but in my experience  France had the nicest roads. On the flip side  it seemed like there was a toll every 5 miles in France. The speed limit on the French motorway was around 80mph. 2. In those 400 miles on the autobahn  I was surprised how many long sections actually had limits in place. 3. A LOT less semi traffic and in places where there are 3 lanes  they are not allowed in the far left passing lane  which makes sense. This makes a huge difference. In Iowa  on the interstate  if you are being held up it usually because a semi slowed everything down. 4. I was driving a pretty slow (By U.S. standards) BMW small SUV. I cruised at about 100-110mph and never went above 120mph. I rarely got passed but the one time I did it was glorious. A red Ferrari accelerating out of traffic. 5. Traffic is an issue in some places around cities. In these places  it's no different than the U.S. 6. Tons of road construction  which limited lanes. The weird thing is that it was the middle of the week and I didn't see any road construction people actually working. 7. Lane Discipline. It's true what they say  they have it and I long for it in the U.S. 8. Petrol is ungodly expensive
1811,I'm gearing up to record the next episode of RPG University  the RPG-focused podcast  where I will be sitting down with the co-writer for the Red Opera campaign module about the process that goes into producing a published work like this  and answering your questions about how to do the same! Post any questions you have about the process  creating The Red Opera  or anything else regarding fleshing out a new campaign world! Credit will be given if your question is selected :D
1812,I'm glad the article mentioned Charlie/Blaine  as I was weirdly peeved that there was a game that was(as I saw it) a blatant rip-off.   It's funny how just an acknowledgment of inspiration can change one's perception of a thing. I don't know WHY I cared  either.
1813,I'm going to ask the seeming dumb questions rq:   1. Why are you trying to get this person into RPGs?  Are they curious already?  Are they looking for unconventional teaching tools for future lesson plans??  Or are you trying to introduce them due to other interests they have  or are you just trying to force games onto someone with no interest (or even a stated dislike).    2. Why does it have to be historical?  I get this is an history teacher  but teachers aren't just the subject they teach (at least until you are dealing with college ans even then...).  is it being historical a stated desire by them  something based on their interests  or just a stereotype that they are a history teacher and thus must want to run historical games only.
1814,Im going to assume that realism here means high lethality and firearms means like modern firearms rather than black powder. If Im wrong  let me know.  The Silhouette systems was mentioned already  but Ill specifically point you to [Heavy Gear](https://www.drivethrurpg.com/m/product/837). Thats the 2nd edition  which is simpler than the Silhouette Core version. Its a game about mech fights in a very specific setting  but you can ignore that and use if for general modern era stuff.   It has a very simple system  for everything you just roll d6s equal to your skill and then add your attribute bonus. Usually those are in a 1-3 range. The math of that works out to give you a lot very average results. The combat system replaces HP with wound thresholds. If you take enough damage to suffer a wound then you take one and otherwise you dont. Wounds tend to really mess you up  so a severe one will have you barely able to walk. Fights tend to go quickly  because taking a gunshot wound means youre probably unconscious and bleeding out.  D100 systems got a lot mentions  so Ill point out  [Delta Green](https://www.delta-green.com). Its designed for X-Files/Cthulhu stuff  but you can ignore that and use it for modern espionage  military  or whatever.   Extremely simple to run. You have a bunch of skills rated from 1-100. You roll d100  below or equal to your skill is success  above is failure. Occasionally there are modifiers  but its usually +/-20. Has a really cool system for automatic fire that means you dont have to roll 20 attacks when you fire 20 bullets. If you get hit with automatic weapons fire  youre probably just straight up dead. It also has great rules for stuff like area suppression and such  which are good because thats how guns are mostly used in real combat.
1815,I'm going to encourage you and offer .02.  You are learning a new vocabulary. This requires a new mode of thinking.  You have all the mechanical skills required to make a game. The big change is in understanding that you must view the tools  the code  the approaches differently.  First  brush up on OOP and 'Design Patterns'. I've met alot of Web programmers who never dealt with significant amounts of OOP and many who never learned any  'design patterns' (check out the Gang of Four to start  design patterns solve common programming problems and learning to implement them will solve a great deal of issues). Once you have those down  and not BEFORE  check out this game programming specific guide. It is entirely free online (though I did order a print version cause I have gotten alot of mileage out of it)  [https://gameprogrammingpatterns.com/](https://gameprogrammingpatterns.com/)  Next.  Write a barebones simple classic arcade game clone. Something like Pong  or a Mario style platformer etc. Be sure to do all the menus etc.   Next.  Write a simple early Final Fantasy clone  make it complete.  Do these  make them barebones.   Use simple shapes for graphics. Just boxes and squares and some text etc. Graphics are an illusion  don't get hung up on them.  Believe it or not  this is 90% of all game programming. Just get these basics and start bolting features etc. onto them to make something more complex. 2d is HARDER than 3d in alot of ways and these two simple core games will cover more than you can imagine. Believe it or not it DOESN'T get much more complicated than this (as long as your doing it right!). Game programming isn't hard as much as it is EXPANSIVE. Their are a LOT of basics  but once you have your head wrapped around these it will no longer be difficult. The initial learning curve is just REALLY REALLY intimidating.  \*note : I am an idiot  and these are my opinions  I am possibly wrong.  Good Luck
1816,I'm going to mention two unique series:  * ***SaGa***: this is one of the oldest RPG series (more than 30 years old). It's pretty unique in a lot of ways  and it's a gameplay-heavy series. Open world  weird combat mechanics (like learning abilities by chance)  no traditional leveling system... If you want the most innovative SaGa games  they are probably *Unlimited SaGa* and *SaGa Scarlet Grace*. But I think you can call any of them innovative. * ***Atelier***: this is a pretty big series that gets a new title every year. Their gameplay is unique in that they have a big focus on their crafting system  which is pretty complex and well-developed. And some of the games have pretty deep combat systems. Also  half of them have a time limit mechanic  which is also not that common in the genre and maybe you appreciate as something different.
1817,Im going to say paladin with dragoons as a second. I like how paladins can deal damage and heal. I like the sacrifice move in Dragon Quests where you give your life to bring your whole team back to life. Badass
1818,I'm gonna go a little outside the box and hit up the GameCube with Skies of Arcadia  a wonderful gem of a turn based JRPG about Fantasy Sky Pirates  with memorable characters  solid combat and great pacing.  We always hear about the glory of the SNES RPGS (all accurate  by the way...Chrono Trigger is my personal GOAT)  but GameCube sometimes gets left out of the conversation. Baten Kaitos  Tales of Symphonia and the big daddy himself  Paper Mario: The 1000 Year Door are all wonderful RPGs on GamteCube also worth checking out.
1819,I'm gonna list a few underrated gems:  * King of the Braves GaoGaiGar - The final entry into the Brave series  unlike the other ones which feature a sentient robot as the main robot  GaoGaiGar is piloted. Gai is a hot blooded badass who screams his attack names. The series itself is some of the best super robot action to ever be animated.    * Marriage of God & Soul Godannar - Massively underrated. It's a homage to 70s super robot shows. It's nothing incredible  but it's a fun show.  * Gunbuster - This is an absolute masterpiece of a series  taking homage from Aim for the Ace!  a tennis series  it features a teenage girl as our main character. Throughout the series we watch her grow from the crying little girl into someone who does what has to be done. This is directed by Hideaki Anno  and features a the prototype for Asuka's character. Red headed foreigner  who becomes the MCs rival.   * Shin Mazinger - A reimagining of the classic 70s Mazinger Z. Better animation  a banger of an OP and to top it off  the story is a fun ride.   * Literally anything Getter Robo - This is one of *the most* underrated franchises. 3 flyers combine into one big robot that has 3 different combinations. Hot blooded action  great mecha designs  what more can you ask for?   * Dai-Guard - A different robot anime in general. Three office workers have to pilot a giant robot together. It's a fun series  it's not a war story or anything  it's salarymen piloting a giant robot.     Gurren Lagann is massively different from Gundam. GL is a super robot anime  meaning the plot is a little crazier  the characters are sillier  and the robot designs are more outlandish. While Gundam is real robot  which has a slightly more grounded series  typically a war drama  with the designs being fairly similar.
1820,I'm gonna need more specs. It's fun to continue the iconic cars from the 90s but I can't help but wonder how they fit in today's market. Specifically FWD in a sports oriented car becomes a much bigger disadvantage as power levels increase  and we're certainly at peak power in automotive history.
1821,I'm gonna need to go to the hospital after watching this. Need to make sure I don't have diabetes from all the sweetness this episode had.  The cast  op and ed are just so lovely. Really enjoyed seeing Sakurai and Kazama's moments like how he called her so she could away from their co-worker. Anyone think they look a bit like Yukino and Hachiman from Oreigaru?  Looking forward to more of this show
1822,Im halfway through s3. I knew it wasnt *great*  but now that Im relatively far into it and not much is improving  Im wondering if its worth watching at all.   For reference  Im talking about character development  plot development  twists  fight scenes  worldbuilding and the story in general.
1823,Im hoping my RS5 becomes a desirable car since it was the last NA V8 Audi made  the 8 200 redline  and limited production numbers. I only put around 3 500 miles a year on it so if I kept it 20 more years itd still have under 100k on it.
1824,I'm in a very similar position. Earlier this year I bought a  YamahaTracer 900  my dream bike. Skip to July my boss gave me a choice of being retrenched or doing a lower job at less 40percent salary. I cut as much as I could. I have no medical aid no insurance  sold my car and the bike really should go but I'll never get one like it again. It would be like admitting defeat but I know it's the right choice to make. It's just a thing  but also it's not. It's what defines me and I will be very sad to see it go.
1825,I'm in the minority here. I didn't really have a lot of interest until about age 25. I grew up in a family that didn't really drive anything exciting (Corollas  base trim pick-ups  etc) and grew up without cable TV. Didn't have fast internet until a year before college. So I didn't really have exposure to cool cars in real life or TV/internet in my childhood which I think made me feel like my family that vehicles are basically just appliances.   Now I'm 31 and while I still don't drive anything super exciting  I've been exposed to how many cool cars are out there and that makes all cars more interesting to me.
1826,I'm interested see si and type r. I think the looks of new gen are growing on me. Especially compared to new new wrx or golf. Being a little boring or looking like an acord is better than what we got with those. I wondering how much different we'll get in terms of performance though older civics. The hatch and standard sedan seem about same as last gen.
1827,I'm inviting anyone to come plant a garden in my front yard.  I keep all the vegetables  you get the satisfaction of doing the hard work for some asshole who does nothing and takes the profit.  If you can grow weed for me I can offer you even more satisfaction in your hard day's work  but not one penny.
1828,I'm just replacing an old SUV with the Tesla.   I'm not a fan of 4WS as it just adds cost  weight  complexity  and more failure points. For some reason people who pull horse trailers are obsessed with 4WS and they buy-up all the old GM pickups that have it  but I've never seen any other sub-groups that it mattered to. If it was optional I'd pass on it.
1829,I'm just totally caught up with Black Clover anime and Manga it was generic in the beginning but it go better and better  as we go. I don't wanna loose the hype.. Suggest me a good anime to start watching right away.   Ps: I'm upto date and completed naruto  db  bleach  naruto  fairy tale  Tokyo revengers  my hero academia  jujitsu kaisen  Tokyo ghoul  one punch man  AOT  SWO  Fate franchise  demon slayer and all these other regular stuff everyone recommends.
1830,I'm kinda curious why they don't offer a better model at the cost of it only being usable at lower frame rates. if they were to design a model around a 4ms target it wouldn't be applicable to as high FPS scenarios as the 2ms implementation but the fidelity/artifacting should be better. So those running 60Hz monitors can get better fidelity/less artifacting than those running 144Hz+ monitors.
1831,"I'm leaning towards *Cthulhu Dark* or *Trophy Dark* because of the focus on investigation and the mechanical support for prioritizing self-preservation over ""the team"". In either case the rules are super simple d6 pool building with strong collaborative mindset."
1832,Im liking the design direction. Understated  classy looking. Its been a long time since I liked a Honda interior. Definitely looking forward to the type r  the last generation was just too busy looking.
1833,Im looking for crackhead game (urban surival games with good atmosphere). For example  Stalker or Neo Scavenger. The actual format of the game doesnt matter (Stalker is FPS and Neo Scav is text based for instance)  all that matters is strong atmosphere and urban survival setting
1834,Im looking for new games to introduce to my group. Im a player/side GM for a group of roughly 5 or 6 people (depending on who can show up for that night) the main GM and I have talked back and forth about after finishing or most recent 5E DnD campaign to try and get the others into trying new games. The problem is a good half of our group is relatively new to table top rpgs  with one in particular being of the chaotic stupid variety.   Wed like to branch out a bit and try different games that arent do difficult for beginners (or people who dont really care) to learn and adapt to. Weve talked about some games but were worried the chaotic idiot wouldnt know what to do and we dont really have the heart to kick him out. Any recommendations for fairly simple or interesting games would be greatly appreciated!
1835,Im looking for the subs input regarding putting regular gas in a premium recommended car  specifically the 2022 Genesis GV70.  I have the opportunity to buy a beautiful 3.5 twin turbo  Adriatic Blue GV70 Sport Prestige as my daily driver. Ive always used premium gas in my current car  but nowadays premium is over $3.70 a gallon and I hear pricing is only going to get worse with everything going on in the country.   Everything Ive been told from the dealer is that while premium is recommended  its not required. Growing up  its always been drilled into my brain that you never put regular gas in a car that takes premium or you risk ruining the engine in the long run. On the other hand  i have read that todays engines have control systems that will compensate for low octane by adjusting ignition timing to avoid engine knocking. Ive also read that you may get worse fuel economy using a lower octane than recommended.  Is it worth attempting to use regular gas in a premium recommended car with todays gas prices  or will I somehow screw up the engine down the road? In theory I could always switch back when gas prices (hopefully) go back down. I wont be driving it like a race car so a slight decrease in acceleration is of no concern to me if it only affects the performance.  I appreciate any input from this knowledgeable community!  Edit: For those concerned  I can afford all potential expenses on the car with ease and I currently pay for premium gas on a premium required car. The fundamental question was whether anyone has knowledge using regular gas in a premium-recommended car  if it is not a premium required car. Thank you to all who have answered that question.
1836,I'm looking this up and...  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bmYeHdwOpfo  ...am I right in thinking this does what Mario RPG does with real-time minigame shit during JRPG battles?  It's a dealbreaker for me if it does. Can't stand mixing JRPG with real time stuff.
1837,I'm looking to do some track days now that I've got a car worth tracking.  I've got a lot of experience with serious simulators like iRacing but have never attended a real track day.  So  I understand the mechanics of actually driving on an empty track  but I'm completely blind to the reality of actually prepping a car  the paperwork  track day etiquette  etc.  If you're new to track days yourself  what are some of the lessons that you've been learning?  If you're a veteran  what are some of the things you see new guys doing that drive you nuts  or are just plain unsafe?  Hoping that I can get this info from you guys before I show up and potentially make an ass of myself.  Thanks!
1838,Im looking to start working on cars  and I just wanted to find a community of people who were doing the same. Also just a space to lurk on and see what/how people have been doing to their cars. Obviously this subreddit is great but I feel like its mostly enthusiasts/news/memes which I love  just looking for something specific.   Also if anyone has recommendations for finding people around me who are into cars Id love that. All my friends are  like myself  far from the automotive world. I live in the outskirts of the Bronx.
1839,I'm loving Pathfinder. I skipped Solasta mainly because it's not supposed to be great for story. Also  I wasn't impressed with the choices for races/classes for Solasta. Just pretty basic.  Solasta's supposed to be really good for combat  though.
1840,"I'm making a game.  I'm torn between implementing a classic ""newgame+"" system after the story  or just adding a lot of endgame content to explore.  I only have the sanity and time to choose one or the other  realistically.  Reddit likes giving opinions  right?  [View Poll](https://www.reddit.com/poll/q06n5y)"
1841,I'm mid-50s and everyone in my group is 45+ except for my son who joins us for Pathfinder. Of the current players  I'm the one who has been there the longest as I joined in '89.  I admit to being a butterfly jumping from game to game  so picking up new games as they come out is fine by me. And I think that Pathfinder 2e is the best D&D system to date.  We don't pick up many new players as we are a very stable group  but back in the day we added some players via penandpapergames.com which had LFG feature. That site seems defunct.  I guess I'm one of the oldest at the gaming stores. But a few years ago I saw a group playing AD&D  so I assumed there was a community for older games. I'm sorry to hear that you have a hard time playing the games you like.
1842,I'm mostly curious about possible exceptions. If a company wants to release a product covered by this regulation that requires more power than USB-C can provide (or whatever other requirement that USB-C doesn't meet)  is that a valid reason to not use a USB-C port?
1843,I'm new to game design and I have a few knowledge on programming after testing out game maker studio but I'm having troubles with character sprites  I want to create a RPG game like final fantasy VI but I don't want to make it in pixel art style and more of a 2d style like Don't Starve. How big should the individual spirite be? Will it still be in pixel if I downside it?
1844,Im no Tesla fan but arent Model S back ordered for months? Im sure lack of supply has something do with it. If Im ready to plop down $100k+ on a new car I dont want to wait like 6 months to get it.
1845,"I'm not a huge RPG player  i played some of them (Morrowind  Oblivion  Skyrim  Witcher 3  recently Diablo etc.) and even though i found them beautiful and fun etc. i've never completed one  i think more for time reasons considering that i've enjoyed more dynamic and ""shorter"" games  but  i'm still fascinated by the genre and i often play some of the games i cited.  I want to ask you  what is the best isometric RPG to get start with? Actually i'm installing Divinity Original Sin 2 (which has intrigued me for years and I've always kept an eye on the prices to get the best offer (which came but didn't get it in time  grr)) and also Arcanum Of Steamworks and Magic Obscura because i saw it's one of the more recommended in the genre... Are those games good starting points? I still have Diablo on my laptop but it annoys me to play tbh. Other recommendations? I was interested in Baldur's Gate but i read that it's a good start point for ""new"" player (in quotes cause i played the genre and i know how they work)"
1846,Im not a professional game developer  however  I have launched 3 successful startups.  Your screenshots and descriptions make the game sound like work to play.  This was how I felt after reading  It will be a long journey of crafting  industry  exploration and transformation to terraform the planet. Sound pretty dull TBH.  I suspect the game is good but your pitch is missing because you are not getting people excited about your idea and why its fun in the first 30 seconds.
1847,Im not a tech but I own a dealership.  The problem with warranty work is that some manufacturers are difficult at times when it comes to covering an issue under warranty.  Ford in particular can be a bit of a pain in the ass  I remember once hearing that it was like dealing with an HMO and Id agree with that.  Warranty work is profitable (aside from some warranty labor times being almost ridiculously low) but that assumes the factory is going to pay for the job.  If the factory doesnt approve the claim its difficult for us to just throw an engine in a car for free  and if the factory doesnt agree with the diagnosis the fun begins.  If its a known issue its generally pretty cut and dried  the AC compressor is leaking  theyll cover it.  If a 20k mile WRX comes in with a blown engine you bet theyre going to investigate the shit out of the claim before just paying for an engine.  If theres evidence of a tune of aftermarket parts or lack of maintenance theyre very quick to deny the claim.
1848,Im not a wrench. But the motivation at the dealer level is the exact opposite of what youre suggesting. Dealer service departments love warranty work. They want to get your repair covered. Its not their money to protect  its the manufacturers. The dealer is motivated to find things the manufacturer will pay for.
1849,I'm not against this but they have to be willing to throw away what people like about every other BRs if they want to succeed  and I really hope they have the courage. If 343 tries to blindly go and make a Halo inspired Apex/Warzone/Fortnite skin I think people will reject it; I probably will.  If they try to capture the chaos of playing on Blood Gulch scaled up to 100 people I think they'll do well.
1850,I'm not an Isekai guy  but Im enjoying this one. It helps that the Isekai element so far is just window dressing serving as an explanation for why he can learn things quickly. The ethereal tone helps it stand out for me along with the 3 Men and a Baby conceit with Wills family.   Sadly looks like that part will ending soon. Will is coming up on the end of his training and is ready to become a man at 15. Theres also this mystery they keep alluding to with why exactly is Will there and whats going on with his family. The scenes with Gus in the dungeon and the room point to something weighing heavily on him. Enough for him to ask Will to fail and stay longer. At this point  I hope its as big a deal as theyre making it out to be.   Still managed to fit some lighthearted scenes in though. Blood is always fun. The gambling scene got a big laugh out of me. Gus money obsession comes back in a pretty funny way and Mary just drilling into all three of them is a classic mom moment. Even if we lose these characters I hope that tone balance continues.   Next week hopefully gets to the overall plot of the story. Im curious what exactly is Wills role in all this and who are the other characters in the OP/ED.   Notes  - So Will was just grinding for XP and loot in the same dungeon? Props for picking up a rare weapon in your first run buddy!   - For how tense the scene was  it was still funny to see Gus triple casting like a badass. Tough it was back to heartbreak when Will called him Grandpa.  - Looking like a man now uhh sure Mary. Totally ignore how androgynous Will looks. Also doubt he can grow a beard.   - Probably pledge himself to whichever god gives him healing. Im sure being raised by undead means hes lacking in that ability.
1851,I'm not aware of any but it'd be an interesting concept to play with. You'd probably want a system where greater character skill impacts *choice* of die to roll; i.e.  if your character's really good at X you have a better chance of selecting the appropriate die to counter whichever one you're rolling against.
1852,Im not confident blizzard will ever make another good original game. Overwatch 2 will be a flop  im 100% sure. The decision to take a competitive multiplayer game and focus its sequel on PVE is nonsensical and baffling. As a PC game giant  The decision for them to focus on a mobile ARPG for the past few years also makes no sense.  I love diablo a lot so Im more optimistic for D4  but I also think there is a high probability it sucks. Theyve just lost it.   Shadowlands was garbage  overwatch 2 has no chance of being good (for the fans of OW1) because they focused on PVE  Diablo resurrected is a mobile game  they abandoned the warcraft rts series for no reason and still havent started on starcraft 3.   I want to play D2 resurrected but I would genuinely feel bad rewarding a company that  time and time again  shows it is disconnected from its fans and just doesnt seem to care about making the games we want to play.
1853,I'm not going to play through the game twice just to start enjoying it. I don't like easy games  I don't get the point. So far I've only found two that look like they work  diablo 2 resurrected on /player 8 and dungeons and dragons heroes on nightmare difficulty for orig xbox. I'd love to have more options but I've done a lot of searching and as far as I can tell there aren't any.
1854,I'm not happy about this.  I've had 3 pixel phones that used usb-c  all of them eventually needed replaced because the charger stopped taking power.  The usbc cable becomes so loose it won't even stay in.  I eventually switched to iphone  resolving not to be ripped off by cheap charger ports again and a little over a year in and my cable still locks in firmly.  Usbc sucks
1855,I'm not so sure about the converting to other systems part - but I found Waterdeep - Dungeon of the Mad Mage to be pretty good for re-using.  It's like 20+ levels and you can rip any level out that fits your campaign since they are all so different.
1856,Im not sure if you like JRPGs  but from the games I have seen thus far I think not.  Anyways  the TALES Series and FINAL FANTASY Series is playable with a controller on Steam. Same goes for DISGAEA Series  altho this is not fully JRPG.  Besides that I can only say Dragon Age  Bioshock and Tomb Raider.
1857,I'm not sure that question can be answered in a suitably generic way. Different games are going to have very different shelf lives depending on sales  the size of the print run  the company's logistics  new editions  and a lot of other factors.
1858,"I'm not sure this is an issue for me. I just like cars - there really isn't a ""brand"" that I hate and I think they all offer some interesting vehicles. I've owned a little bit of everything at some point and I've generally enjoyed them all for different reasons. I've always found the kind of tribalism that is so common among car enthusiasts to be not only off-putting  but puzzling."
1859,I'm not sure what you mean by realistic but the two systems that try to model reality most closely are GURPS (see [http://www.sjgames.com/gurps/books/tacticalshooting/](http://www.sjgames.com/gurps/books/tacticalshooting/)) and BRP variants such as mythras ( see for free [https://www.drivethrurpg.com/product/105453/Mythras-Firearms](https://www.drivethrurpg.com/product/105453/Mythras-Firearms)).  Rules light games are more likely to attempt model the feel of gun play in media  more often towards the action movie end of things. See Feng Shui for an example.  Personally I have no idea  and hope never to find out  what gun combat is really like.
1860,I'm older and not really a big fan of 5E either. My go to games now days are DCC or C&C. I have a decent group of players now  but it took some work. I went to the local game club and started playing 5E games with strangers. Then I started running 5E games  using conversions of old AD&D modules. After players got to know me they were more open to try games that were not 5E.
1861,I'm older and play with younger players. I sometimes GM. I don't mind age differences  just don't be a jerk and have fun. Did you play other games back in the day? Gamma World  Paranoia  Runequest  Star Frontiers  Cyberpunk 2020  Top Secret  Traveller  etc.?
1862,I'm older than you  but we play a very niche game from '82 so finding new people is difficult.  Before COVID I was running a 5e game and I was turning away players left and right.  I farmed the 5e game for players to stick into my niche game.  Oddly most of them quit the 5e game and just played the niche game when they realized it was more fun!  I think the presentation has a lot to do with it.  Many older gamers are very grognard in appearance  tend to be extremely salty  and of political persuasion that is unattractive to young people.  I've found avoiding that appearance goes a long way in getting younger players interested.    Along that vein  many younger players do not like the type of games that were played back in the 80s.  They are more interested in the games du jour  or at least of this century.  It goes a long way for an older gamer to be willing to play 5e and other games that aren't exactly your main preference.    Personally  I can't stand playing 5e  but I can stand being the DM  so that is what I do.  So  I'm not seeing the issues you are seeing  but that is mostly because I've avoided looking and acting so grognardish and salty  though I may actually be both!
1863,I'm only starting now  but I would like to assemble a team sometime in the future for things like music  art direction and such. What are the best means for finding others? And how successful have you guys found
1864,I'm playing one/two chapter of each character at a time.  Like:  Play chapter one with Yuito  Play chapter one and two with Kasane  Play chapter two and three with Yuito  ...  It has actually been a good experience for me to play like this. Let the two sides of the story fresh on my mind.
1865,Im pretty much a forever GM. I introduced my group to Numenera and 5e in college. The reason I introduced it was cause if I didnt no one would. Ive been dming now for 8 years. For me being a dm wasnt about fear or not feeling it  but it was about not being able to experience something that is worth experiencing.
1866,I'm pretty much a full stack developer  I've done everything (over 25 years)  from technical backend stuff  frontend  middleware; you name it.  I've also always wanted to make a game and I've done graphics/game programming my whole life; but I only recently managed to finish a very small (and 100% unsuccessful) remake of an old arcade game. I would have estimated that it would take me 2 weeks  but in reality it was a month and a tiny bit.  You run into a ton of problems along the way  but the only way is to persevere and finish it.
1867,I'm pretty sure it's just a percentage reduction of the amount of damage the person would have taken had they had no armor at all. For instance  if it absorbed 50% (not actual number I imagine)  and you took 40  you'd take 20 health damage and then some amount of armor damage in place of that (not sure if that would make up the remainder). Additionally  the suit also has a few environmental traits  which seem to typically act as a way of preventing automatic death in things like toxic material or  upon being poisoned  in favor of restoring health back to nearly normal  after some time has passed.
1868,Im pretty sure my friend is going to a pretty good game design program with emphasis on conceptual art in Arizona so maybe do some research there.  But the guy at the top is right  if you have a degree with a weak portfolio to show for it then from a hiring standpoint the degree is worthless. Just make sure you arent spending thousands on a degree when you could be expanding your skills just as fruitfully through independent study and online courses.
1869,"i'm prolly the only person that has no perf issues with Win11 and amd cpus and found it faster than even a clean 10 after filling in all the drivers lol. Haven't pushed the testing as far as cache latency but ""real life scenario"" benchmarkings (starting software and gauging execution time or FPS in 3D rendering alongside day to day use) was leaning toward a better 11 lately.  Did they leave the os on stock drivers ?  Technically they did good work at MS i thought. TPM requirements was a nearly political decision however (and a crap one despised) (but then it's the same thing as always with many US or similar corporations; frequently good technical work by the engineers/developpers  with very questionable commerciallo-political decisions alongside)"
1870,I'm quite fond of FATE: the Traitor Soul. It's basically a prototype for Torchlight 1&2  but I think it's mechanically distinct enough to hold up on its own. Traitor Soul is technically the third game in the series  but the Steam release incorporates all of the content from the previous two games with it.
1871,I'm quite new to gamedev and am looking to make a simple web-based game. I have a grasp on C++  so I'm mainly looking to do it in cpp. What I'm wondering is: would a framework or an engine be better for a simple but multiplayer game (like  for example  agar.io or slither.io)  that would later be ported to the web?  I would use UE4  but I don't really like blueprints and it seems that UE may be overkill for something like agar.io.  As for frameworks  I'm not sure whether it would be best to use SFML or SDL2  or something entirely different. I've heard that SDL is more low level and C-style  though it can be used with C++ - how would this impact someone trying to make a game in C++? I've also heard about some problems with SFML  but I'm not sure how prevalent they are.  Finally  what would be more difficult to learn? UE macroed C++ and API  SDL  or SFML?
1872,I'm really curious about what Gus's real intention is.  In the first episode he mentioned Will being of use for something(?)  and again in this episode he seriously intended to harm Will (I even questioned if he *really* was Gus or was it some demon posing as him  as he was so serious) and later on wished for Will to intentionally lose in the upcoming fight against Blood. Maybe everything is related to the city's downfall(?) and Gus doesn't want Will to know about it.  One point to note. If you *really* want to gamble  don't do it anywhere near Mary  or else the result will be....disastrous.
1873,I'm really happy we should be able to have the option to buy the Torrent again soon with this new hub tested and given the thumbs up. However it only adds to my dilemma  it's either the Torrent or the 011 Air Mini for my PC upgrade and I just can't decide!
1874,I'm really into collecting scenarios/ rulebooks/whatever that relate to my hometown which is  admittedly  not a very well known place. Does anyone else pick up rpg stuff that's either set in your hometown or related to it? Tell me about your favorites if you do! I bet it's a lot easier to find things if you're from bigger cities haha.
1875,I'm really loving the improvements to animation  characters move way more naturally.   The one complaint I have is that Yuzuru didn't do a [Violet](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bFX44Y0elYI) when Kage ratted him out.
1876,Im relatively new but im learning extremely fast and im already pretty good the only things i hate are animations and of course i still have alot to learn im looking for someone to work with on a side project type game i want to make a first person doctor strange type game or something along the lines of that if anyone wants to be partners and develop a game together hmu this is not a job just a hobby / learning opportunity
1877,I'm running Ryzen and I'm not being offered win11 through windows update. The way the vast majority of win users update I'm sure.   You have to go out of your way to upgrade to win11. It may be officially released but nobody's using it yet except for a few early adopters.
1878,I'm running Unhallowed Metropolis and having trouble finding resources beyond core books  two intro adventures  and the gazetteers on DriveThruRPG. My Google searches have been similarly fruitless.   Does anyone know of any resources (preferably modules  but at this point I'm not picky) or have any homebrew they'd like to share?  I have a full-time job and run this monthly UM game plus one weekly and one monthly D&D game&mdash;I don't have time to make something completely original  but I am cool with modifying and tweaking.  Any help is appreciated. Thanks!
1879,Im seeing some really horrible stuff about the game from play testers which leads me to believe that EA Games is about to pull a cyberpunk.  Was considering preordering the game but now I might wait.  Someone else on Reddit here said the weather mechanic pretty much ruined the game for them.  Theres no reason to make people sign an NDA for a game youre about to release unless youre worried about sales going down because you did something **REALLY** shitty and you know you cant backtrack.
1880,Im so happy right now! Im Austrian and half German and Im sooooooo happy the great highway of Germany will be also great in the next time. Its one of the securest highways of the world - And cause it doesnt haves speed limit one of the absolutely best!
1881,I'm sorry  but this is some horseshit. No concrete infromations  'Skyrim vibes' (what is this even supposed to mean? It's almost worse than repeated all the time 'Dark Souls vibes')  generic praises that you can say about every game. Even in this thread there are people praising the game for its pre-rendered trailer. I hope this is just some weak advertisement campaign  beceause if anything it makes me even less interested than I was when I heard the director (or other lead  whatever) got changed.    It always goes the same way  if they have something to show or share  developers talk about the story or essence of the game  if they have nothing  they resort to talking about the engine and bullshit like graphics or 'destructible environment'. The history tells us how it ends.  This is not a good look for the game.
1882,I'm still amazed what an ugly mess this thing is. The position of dpad and face buttons is a joke. At least the Steam Controller tried to be different and sticked with it  while here they didn't know what direction to choose  so they just slapped everything on it. It only gets a pass  because it is made by Valve.
1883,Im still just eagerly awaiting the day we get a Thunderbolt KVM/switch. Its not the end of the world to plug and unplug one cable when I switch between my desktop and laptop but it would be even better if I didnt have to.
1884,Im still learning programming by myself and taking college courses there are disadvantages to learning this stuff cause information can be hard to process but it takes time of course and you need to understand some aspects to understand the other. Also friends and colleagues can be helpful to introduce you to some ideas or the community itself. It depends on the person thats learning some approaches to studying work some dont. I would still recommend reading or watching general programming and computer science in general and see how you would apply what you learned to game dev. Im learning graph theory and search algorithms to see how theyre applied to pathfinding
1885,I'm struggling with blowing people's mind off  it backfires often.  People don't want great things  they don't like a painting  a song  a game or a sculpture to change their outlook on life  they like same old  don't do art. If you wanna please  do porn or youtube  art is for no one.
1886,Im struggling with this too. I run a 5e game at our local game store and Id really like to end it and move on to some indie systems like mothership and Liminal.  Trying to figure out how to tell them and when to end it.
1887,Im surprised at the amount of people trying to make the claim in these comments that VTM doesnt have inherent sexuality when  RAW  the Kiss is an erotic and sensual experience for both the vampire and the victim. Like  its baked into the very foundation of the game  and is absolutely intentional. Just because your table ignored that part doesnt mean that the game itself did.
1888,I'm surprised no one has mentioned computer graphics things. By that I mean linear algebra  OpenGL/Vulkan/DirectX  (maybe) rendering pipelines  (maybe) game engines  (maybe) vector calculus etc... I'd even perhaps actually build a simple game or two to see how the graphics come about. Check out Handmade Hero for example  or Handmade Quake (I think the Quake one is dead tho ).  What I'm trying to get at is you clearly now know how to design logic circuits  but do you know what you need to design? The general algorithmic challenges and context around graphics. (I know how to design circuits  but what circuit am I designing/updating?)
1889,I'm the opposite  I can make multiple basic toy games a week. Learning webdev is hell. I can get a basic functional site  but it will be ugly as hell. CSS is a joke. I use JS with games so it's not a problem for me to use it here too but my god. MY GOD I cannot understand how you can just sit and webdev. The finished product is just so boring that I feel like I've wasted hours even if it's direly useful. I feel you went at it from a pure JS standpoint  and yeah that's tougher  but use an engine like Unity or Godot and you can skip basic rendering code and such and get into the meat of actually making a game.
1890,I'm the same  I'm also currently playing pathfinder and find that I never really want to play it  every few days I put it on and enjoy playing it but there's never that urge to really want to continue.  I did however start my second playthrough of divinity 2 yesterday and although I finished it first time on tactician am now trying a lone wolf run and I realise immediately why it's so loved  I can't wait to play it  I think it's just whatever mood your in  sometimes I just want to mindlessly shoot things  sometimes I want to get lost in a fantasy world sometimes I don't know what the fuck I want and browse steam for hours lol  I will say though  a couple years ago I stopped forcing myself to play games that I'm no longer enjoying and it's so freeing  we play to have fun  if it's not fun then uninstall and move on  don't feel guilty about it. Especially RPG games  chances are I've played 20 hours before getting bored  if that's the case then 20 hours of fun is still worth the price even if I quit half through.
1891,Im thinking about going to Atlanta Georgia savannah college of art for their interactive game degree.  I dont want to move to California and live in Texas currently.  Ive read a lot of the threads here about going to school but I want to do concept and environmental art. Does anyone have a suggestion on where to go for school? Ive been told my art isnt good enough for the industry yet so to start with 3D modeling lighting texture and rendering.  I have a photo you guys can list at on my older posts if youd like. Lastly I was told to try to get involved in some projects and wasnt sure where to start: I tried doing some game jams but was useless since they dont have enough time for concept art.
1892,"I'm thinking about trying something... A player just found out they can't make it to the next session of our ongoing campaign. I had the idea of keeping some prepped one-shots in systems which I want to play. That way when someone can't make it I could run something with the people who can...  Could be tricky  but I'd get to try out all the awesome systems  and maybe let a player GM something if they want. (""Let"" isn't the right word  but you know what I mean).  The only issue is that one shots have a tendency to overrun  and we're all stuck for time... Especially my plots. For example  the ongoing campaign started out as a one shot! Lol. I always underestimate how long players take to do stuff."
1893,"I'm thinking of one day making a sandbox game that will take place in a 3D voxel world (cliche  I know). I'd like certain systems in place and to have things like NPCs  and I also want a day/night cycle where the player can sleep through night.   Minecraft handles sleeping by just setting the time to day and not really properly simulating anything. Animals/monsters are exactly where they were when you went to bed  and nothing has actually happened in the ""8 hours"" you were asleep.  I'm thinking it'd be really great to actually simulate the time that passes  let's say at like 40x speed or whatever arbitrary number.  I'm struggling to think of how you'd get this to work  however. In a game engine like Unity  you could probably just set the Time scale to 40  but I think that can only get you so far before you run into problems where the reduced number of Updates have concrete impact on behavior. I'd want the simulation to be as accurate as possible between sleeping and not sleeping through the night.  TLDR: Are there any tips on how to speed-up simulate your world  its systems  and NPCs at e.g. 40x? Any resources on how to go about it? If I know I want to do it up-front  I imagine I can make some architectural programming decisions to facilitate the simulation  but it's difficult to think of exactly what that'd look like."
1894,Im totally opposite  but solely because I have so little spare time. I do however love SHORT RPGs still. But Im not looking to sink 60+ hours in a single game  which would take me possibly months to do  Give me a nice tight 25-30 hour story and I will have a blast. I can finish that in a few weekends and be super happy.
1895,I'm trying to find an anime I watched I cannot remember what the name of it or any of the characters are (forgive the bad description). It's about a kid who finds his old friend who is a cat girl in the courtesan district. The other districts raid the courtesan district and fight up a giant tower against them. One of the courtesans is a giant chick who is eating men. I believe there is magic in it but don't fully remember. I'm so sorry if this doesn't doesn't belong here its just driving me crazy!
1896,im trying to find something just to make me laugh i did not watch anime for a few months because i forgor that anime exist and now there so many new animes i just dont know what to watch the only genre i love is comedy so hit me with anything funny lol
1897,I'm trying to finish off Dragon Quest XI before I spend any money on Tales of Arise :)     Have a bad habit of not finishing my JRPG after putting loads of hours in - so am forcing myself to stop.     Not going to lie  as much as I like Dragon Quest in general - in XI  I've triggered the 'EVENT' around 2/3rds in  and have since struggled to motivate myself to finish. I feel like it's kinda  outstaying its welcome for me right now.   &#x200B;  Hopefully it'll come through and the end will be worth it. I think I have maybe 8-10 hours left to go depending on how much I obsess over side quests!
1898,"I'm trying to refactor some spaghetti code  and have been looking into FSMs. I have a bool called ""targeting"" that affects the camera and the player's rotation  no matter what animation they're performing (idle  running  jumping  attacking  etc.). So it seems like I could fix it by having a function in my state manager like ""isTargeting()""  or even just a bool: ""targeting"". Then that would be checked in the stateManager itself  and could be referenced in any of the states  since it's almost like a layer on top of any other action I'm performing. The alternative seems like having a duplicate of every state that also accounts for targeting  which seems awful  unless I'm misunderstanding the concept.  Is this an ok fix? Or will it lead to problems down the line. Since I'm already taking the time to redo the code I want to get it as clean/scalable as possible  I have to stop myself from slapping on hacky fixes lol"
1899,"I'm unreasonably excited for both self driving cars and Rivian  but...I personally wouldn't drop $10k + $550/y to beta test this (essentially) startup company's first attempt at a car AND self driving.  Like it blows me away Tesla  the most valuable car company in the world with ~~by far~~ \*maybe the most advanced self driving in the world  forgot to program in the ""brake for emergency vehicles"" case. I'd personally be very cautious of any companies first version"
1900,Im using Qubes OS  but I figured this may be a general enough question for someone here to understand what happened. My monitor has a refresh rate of 144hz  but it was set to 60hz by default. I was getting screen tearing  so I tried setting the refresh rate to 144hz using   gtk and   xrandr based off of a generic Linux guide I found. I didnt change anything other than the refresh rate  but i lost all HDMI output. I got a black screen with the no output message on my screen until I rebooted and it defaulted back to 60hz.   I can post the commands I used if thatd help  but I just followed the steps which were exactly the same on multiple Linux guides. I havent been able to figure out what went wrong. Has anyone seen this happen before? Even if I cant get the higher refresh rate working  Id like to learn from this   Thanks!
1901,I'm very happy they made this video  maybe Samsung will start giving a shit.  I'd love to buy a Neo G9  it ticks basically all the boxes for what I need from my main monitor. *In theory.*  In practice  I really am not going to spend 2.5k on a monitor only to faff around with various flickering  scanline and HDR issues.  Edit:   Regarding the lingering issues  personally I really don't care about >>1000 nits brightness  I'd much rather that the scanline issue would be fixed. And flickering is just completely unacceptable.
1902,I'm very hopeful for this game to be the rpg Skyrim is with enough modding  but have better quests and combat. Hopefully it delivers something like that.  I'm just quite bummed that it isn't coming to PS5  but maybe when this releases it is finally time to upgrade my PC from 2016.
1903,I'm wanting to play a new RPG  and I'm hoping you all can reccomend me some good ones.  I'm looking for an RPG that has fun gameplay  good exploration  and interesting ways to build your character.  Any suggestions for RPGs that have those aspects would be great. Thank you in advance.
1904,I'm with you  it's one of my all time favorite games. Kingdom management isn't great  but everything else is just amazing. My favorite part is how the game allows you to really role-play as whoever you want to be. If I had one complain  it would probably that there are no major choices that affect a playthrough. I'm on my third run and it feels very familiar  even though I play evil for the first time. Would have been great to have maybe a chapter that varies based on your changes or something.  I'm already super hyped to play Path of the Righteous on console next year.
1905,I'm wondering if there is an anime where a non human mc  transfers to a human school and tried to hide the fact they are non human. I'm not looking for any op magic school thingy  I'm talking about a normal school. Similar to [Engaged To The Unidentified](https://anilist.co/anime/20483/Engaged-to-the-Unidentified/characters) but I want the actual mc to be the transfer student  where the story is told through their perspective  rather than the transfer student being a main character who knows the mc. Essentially the opposite of [Iruma-Kun](https://anilist.co/anime/107693/Mairimashita-Irumakun).
1906,I'm working through a few RPGs atm. First off Hajimari No Kiseki in the trails series. Awesome game  terrified for it to end though because I know it'll be the end of the Erebonian story arch completely.   I'm also working on Cyberpunk 2077. I know a Lotta shits been said about it but I am enjoying it.   not really sure what I'll do when I finish those 2 games. I'm kinda hoping Kuro No Kiseki gets a translation overlay or I find another JRPG I like. Please don't recommend me tales of arise I already played the demo and I know I hate it
1907,I'm worried something like this would just destroy the company  and considering pathfinder 2e is my groups bread and butter  that would be really unfortunate. I hope they can make working conditions and pay better without killing the whole company as a whole
1908,IMO  the better examples of balance between narrative motivation and XP rewards where in 90'S RPG from Squaresoft. There one could find a perfect agency between all said elements while aiming to complete the adventure and making your characters stronger. The addiction came from a simulation of a  realist  interpretation of what the adventure would be in real life. There was respect for the players  schematic characterisation and symbolic endeavors  deepness hidden in-through every part of the game  even music and themes. Players litteraly felt this while playing. Those are now videogame classics and young developpers should aim for such experiences.
1909,IMO the usefulness of a colector car market is that you can buy them  enjoy them  then sell them without losing money. Garage queens that don't get driven are like collecting art tucked away in a dark warehouse.
1910,"IMO this is reflective of a bigger problem. Or rather two main problems.  First  that character falling behind in level because of missing XP while they're out. IMO this is a bad design--i get the ""realism"" factor of not getting better while you're chilling around the campfire  but it's vastly outweighed by the fun factor. Getting locked into a specific party because of an XP gap sucks. Just keep everyone (approximately) the same.  Second  party balance. This may be an unpopular opinion  but a party needing to be balanced that specifically such that losing a single party member throws you off is bad game design. Like with a level gap  it means that you're essentially stuck with the same party all game. And if you want to play with specific companions you like (or if you want to try different companions on another playthrough) it locks you in or out of specific builds yourself.  Pathfinder: Kingmaker is a game I think did this well. There was an obvious need for party balance  but there were more people in your party than distinct roles needed  and there were multiple characters that could fit each role (or in some cases fill it in combination).  In a well designed game you would feel the loss for story reasons and you should probably need to tweak your party *a bit* but it shouldn't throw off everything"
1911,In 2003 I got a 91 civic (EF/ED6) bc I needed something cheap  reliable and roomy. Paid $1 000 for it from an older man who happened to be the second owner. Still have it today and apparently they've gotten quite popular amongst certain crowds.
1912,In a 3d first person game  like Skyrim  I usually go for a sneaky character. Sniper or melee. In a 2d game  like Pathfinder  I tend toward melee. Probably 2 handed fighter. Maybe a tank. That's for the first playthrough. Later playthroughs I try to be more varied. Few games get a second playthrough.
1913,In all extended travel and especially airplane travel  safety should be your primary concern. Under no circumstances should you leave a laptop powered on and in any sleep/hibernate/standby mode when placed in a bag  backpack  or in an overhead bin. The laptop will overheat as a result of that action  lol what? I thought this issue was fixed on windows some time ago?
1914,In all honesty does it matter? A computer any computer is suppose to do more then just a benchmark or a game. LTT lost touch with real users for a long time now.   example > Do they know what software developers need/use?  example > Do they know how Unity consumes resources?   example > Do they know how much resources is needed to run android studio with virtualization. Do they know that AMD CPUs work but using Intel is a smoother experience?  example > Do they know what the average work load look in  Unreal 5?   The Gaming community is all about top performance and we get that.   But high performance and stable performance isn't always the same thing. And buying the absolute best hardware isn't always the solution.
1915,"In Back 4 Blood there are multiple pandemic references  including the famous ""it's just a flu"". It is both funny and sad since we are talking about a zombie apocalypse.   Seems to be accepted without any drama."
1916,In case anybody's looking for weird dice like these in the UK  I've picked up dice-related gifts for some friends from [Maths Gear](https://mathsgear.co.uk/collections/dice). I think they have non-transitive dice  as well as a set of 4 D12s you can roll to pick a first player that will never result in draws. Random stuff like that.
1917,In case you don't know  it's a rather obscure PS2 game  but it's my favorite game of all time. It has a great story  a unique combat system  dialog that balances humor and seriousness  incredible music  and FMVs that still hold up. If you have a PS2  do yourself a favor. Get it.
1918,"In cases like that  I place a very high value on the canonicity of the *setting*  but prefer to stay well away from canonical *characters and events*.  To use your example  if I were to run a Hogwart's campaign  I'd probably set it 50 years in the future or something like that  so that the PCs will never cross paths with anything that happens in the books.  There are two reasons I'd do things this way:  1. It avoids having to deal with ""do they want to  perhaps  murder Harry Potter"" and then work out the fallout of his death (whether intentional or accidental). 2. It allows the player characters to act freely without having to be bit players in someone else's story.  (This brings to mind the Star Trek TOS/DS9 crossover episode where they edited The Trouble with Tribbles to insert a couple DS9 characters into the background of various scenes.  That's not something I would ever want to do to my players.)"
1919,"In general  - If you do not make money with it (selling copies)  and for private/personal use only  everything is fine. You can create interpretations  hommages  fan addons  expansions  rewrites or simply ""inspired by X"" for it.  - The moment you make money with it with this specific system  it needs to be licensed  if no general license permission (like for some DnD incarnations like OGL) is available.  - Everything else depends on your country  the country where the devs are based and what exactly you want to do.  SYL"
1920,In general  I don't think it matters.  In the case of FFXIV  both exist.  In FFXIV 1.0 the class system was intended to be a set of abilities you could learn from one and then use on any other class.  Eventually  the idea was you could make your own archetype by combining class abilities.  Near the end of FFXIV 1.0  jobs were added  and (iirc) the idea was that if you leveled certain classes you could switch to a job with better stats and more skills  but without the ability to freely use any abilities from any class.  It was effectively another class  with class requirements.  In FFXIV 2.0  the free classing system was removed and a cross-class system replaced it.  This time  only certain 'cross-class' abilities could be used between classes.  Jobs still required two leveled classes  and (iirc) an extra slots for more cross-class abilities.  Near the end of 2.0 a new class and job was introduced that did not require leveling another class.  In FFXIV 3.0  various additions and changes  but no major changes to classes or jobs.  Jobs were the main focus  and although seen rarely in 2.0  you absolutely could not main a class in 3.0 into end-game.  New jobs introduced did not require any class requirements.  In FFXIV 4.0  dual class requirements were removed.  Each existing class in the game corresponded to one Job.  Effectively  this made classes a trial run for their job counterpart.  Cross-class abilities were removed and replaced with role abilities. No longer could you take any cross-classable skills learned by other classes - instead every role had a set of shared skills they could use  limited by slots.  New jobs  no new classes.  In FFXIV 5.0  due to the number of available jobs in the game  additional class/job specific quests were removed.  Previously  new abilities would be earned for completing said quests  but now are granted automatically upon reaching level.  The quests themselves were changed into role quests  and played a part in the story as well as getting special equipment. New jobs  no new classes.  In the future  roles will be a greater focus.  We already have tank  healer  dps trifecta  with dps split into melee  ranged and caster.  The next version will split healers into direct heal and shielder.  This doesn't mean classes or jobs are going away; its just another way they are balancing all the classes/jobs/roles as best they can.  Classes are still 'training wheels' and even though everything is getting watered down to roles  all the jobs are still unique and viable.   Also  in FFXIV crafters and gatherers are classes  and have no job.
1921,In my  last campaign I had a perfectly executed mystery.  The resolution was as if it was written in a novel.  It was wonderful.  I'm a pretty sandboxy GM so that's saying something :) so proud of the accomplishment
1922,"In my case  I want a coupe that also has the same predictable handling in snow conditions as the other front wheel drive cars that I've driven for the past twenty years. The old ""rear wheel drive cars suck in snow"" meme has scared many people away  and some of us just want the look of a coupe without the hard parts of owning a coupe. :-)"
1923,In my case we're a two person indie studio (me & my wife)  and decided to go with a studio twitter.  After running it for a few months  the result is we don't really use our own accounts anymore  and it is a little confusing when posting stuff related to only one of us  say games created in Ludum Dare  etc.  I'm not sure if going along with personal accounts would be better. Each is confusing in its own way.  My tip would be just to do what feels like it'll make you be active  and see what happens.
1924,In my mind  every CRPG games  RPG games published or created by Bethesda and Kingdom Come Deliverance are RPG games. Everything else is not.   I can be wrong and my mind is narrow so feel free to recommend anything new for me to open my mind.
1925,In my opinion : None.  Yes  some are great as they are  but between compatibility issue  outdated visuals or accessibility issue  every game could use a remake to fix past issues and allow new player to discover the game. So while a specific remake might not be for me  it could still be great for others.
1926,in my view they should attach a small bomb to every gpu sold and if you try to mine on it it blows someone elses card up who previously also tried to mine on it so you never know when you're next until you explode then you know
1927,In no particular order:  - 6th Gen Camaro ZL1  - Widebody Dodge Challenger  - Nissan Z Coupe  - 1st gen BMW M4 and M2  - Jaguar F-Type  - Lamborghini Huracan  - Ferrari 458  - Ferrari F8  - Subaru WRX STI  - Lexus LC500   I actually don't think the later refreshes of the SN197 Mustang are going to age well.  It's going to be the first iteration of the SN197 that continues turning heads in later years.  I still love that design to pieces and I don't care how common it is now  it's beautiful  and I have it to thank for bringing back my all time favorite pony car: The Camaro.
1928,In other words  they're continuing the business model that gave us high-quality gems like Silent Hill Downpour. /s  Hopefully  we'll see at least one decent game out of this  but I'm not holding my breath. Konami has no respect for games.
1929,"In recent years  Lincoln has started transitioning back from the ""letter jumble"" naming scheme to a more traditional naming setup (Continental  Navigator  Nautilus  Corsair  Aviator  etc.). Alfa Romeo also has a naming scheme  with the Giulia  Giulietta and Stelvio. Now that we've started seeing that again  I've been thinking a while what other luxury carmakers might rename their vehicles if they followed that trend?  Cadillac  for example  had a bunch of old evocative names  such as deVille  Seville  El Dorado  Barritz. What are some other names they might dip back into if they returned to naming instead of the alphabet soup?  I think it'd be cool if Volvo named their cars after the Scandinavian pantheon (the Volvo ""Odin"" or ""Mjolnir"") or perhaps after landmarks (""Lapplund"" or ""Borealis"" to name a few). Constellations could be another interesting idea.   What are some that you guys can come up with?"
1930,In scripture  angels are less characters and more forces of nature.  Characters in stories are what have personalities  so for angels with personalities you would need to comb through fan wikis of movies  television shows  and animes with angel characters.  Actor Christopher Walken is known for his memorable personality and his injection of such into characters he plays; for me the most interesting and memorable angel character by far is [Christopher Walken's Gabriel](https://www.google.com/search?q=Christopher+Walken+Gabriel) from the *Prophecy* movies. Bonus: In the Prophecy movies  >!Gabriel is a prisoner in Hell for a time.!<
1931,In short yes if you change the overall size of the tire height you change the calculations needed for correct speed and mileage. Most tuners can correct this in an ecu tune so that your speedo/mileage show closer to true though.
1932,In single player I used to play 2H very heavily but recently Ive been very much into ranger classes. I think playing Monster Hunter made me switch it up  I started with a bow and switched to insect glaive. So its kind of similar to a lancer or dragoon in the sense you wield a spear and have extreme mobility with jumps and vaults.   If were talking MMOs I always main a tank though.
1933,In some areas yes  in most areas no. I'm self taught as well but I'm making my dream game (an mmorpg) but if I wanted an interview at Bathesda I would be at a severe disadvantage to the 22 year old that just graduated.
1934,In Stygian Reign of the Old Ones  There's a 'negative xp' counter that goes up alo side the positive one.  Every time you gain a negative level you have to pick some  penalty that sticks with you the rest of the game.  They're meant to replicate the physical and mental scars that inevitably build up when you go investigating a lovecraftian mystery  and replicate the tendency for lovecraft protagonists to go insane by the end of the story.  Unfortunately  Stygian is only half-finished (literally.  The game ends halfway through the main plot)  and has been officially abandoned by the devs.
1935,In Thailand  it is believed if you look between your legs you can see if a ghost is following you.  Makes for interesting tactics if the characters have to fire a ghostbusting gun backwards :)   Also  charms are everywhere. You can extend some metaphysics to say that a particular blessing on a charm from a holy person can allow its bearer to see a ghost  perhaps in combination with an incense stick burning. Just don't drop it :)
1936,In the most genuine and non offensive way  you might need some form of therapy. Sounds like some form of ASD or OCD. I get a similar thing as an aspie  typically from music  but from all sorts (films/video games/other campaigns) but not to the same level) and I dont feel it impacts my life negatively at all.
1937,In the original Half-Life  the HEV Suit's armor not only absorbed 66% of all damage received  it also reduced the total amount of damage any given attack would inflict on the player (i.e. enemy melee attacks would do a total of 6 damage instead of 10 if the suit had power). This changes in Half-Life 2  where the player receives the same amount of damage whether or not the HEV suit has any armor energy. To compensate  the HEV suit armor is more effective in Half-Life 2  absorbing 80% of all damage received instead of 66%.  https://half-life.fandom.com/wiki/HEV_Suit
1938,In the past I saw DL as an elegant solution to many problems but there's nothing elegant about it  learning part is as brute force as it gets. So many projects dealing with image and video are crunching and spending electricity to reinvent a slightly better wheel.      I feel like brute force approach is overused because electricity and semiconductors are very subsidized and true costs are externalised. But what I do I know.      edit: why are you all upvoting my comment  apparently it's wrong. I expected better from you  r/hardware.   I'm not mad  just disappointed.
1939,In the Roblox game  can you clarify the following:  1) was it turn based (nothing moving while you decide) or action based (everything moving at once)?  2) did you control one character or many  3) was the view from above like a chessboard? Following a character? Through the eyes of a character?  4) did you like attacking from a distance or up close?
1940,In the trailer  the magic runes? glyphs? on the hands reminds me of the way Dr. Strange in Marvel movies do his magic and the beast coming from the caverns is basically the Balrog entrance from LotR. I found it a bit jarring but now i want to see more!
1941,In what way does it not make sense financially ? You said in a comment that it wasn't giving you too many problems. Is it too expensive to maintain or taxed too high?  If you are attached to it and you find no rational argument to change  just keep it until it gives you a good reason to change.
1942,"Including crafting in couch multiplayer seems an odd fit to me. Like  couch multiplayer versus  I associate with short rounds. Gang Beasts. Wand Wars. Starwhal. Not games where you have time to craft things.  EDIT: Unless you have some very different idea than me what ""couch-play multiplayer"" means. If it is a Dead by Daylight knock-off  I would think keeping the other players' position a secret seems important  which is hard to do with couch multiplayer."
1943,Infinity engine series is where you should start  those include baldurs gate 1&2  icewind Dale 1&2 and planescape torment.  Then move to arcanum for an amazing setting that I haven't seen replicated in any other game.  Leaving fantasy altogether  you should definitely play fallout 1&2 for the best post apocalyptic RPGs ever made.  Afterwards you can do a big time skip and go directly to obsidians refresh of those old games  starting with Pillars of Eternity 1&2 and then tyranny.  For lower budget indie RPGs that offer two very different but amazing experiences  you can play age of decadence for one of the best narrative focused RPGs with tons of choice and consequence  and underrail for the closest thing you will ever get to the original fallouts.
1944,Instead going out and wasting your time explaining why you don't like a series  why don't you talk about stuff you like i hate this question because it assumes i don't enjoy thinking about a show and why i dislike it.
1945,Instead of an engine you can use a framework  or you can build out all of the tooling to run your own systems with any graphics api.  I'd recommend frameworks until you understand how the pieces interact before diving further  but realistically it's not that hard to make simple 3D platformers.  Typically the only real choke point for beginners is animating the models programmatically.
1946,Intel chips are driving me away from otherwise attractive products like the Surface. Windows 11 is aesthetically and functionally as capable an operating system as Mac OS. The industrial design of Surface Pro 8 is more exciting  albeit not necessarily more heavy duty  than the Macbooks.  But M1 chips are just objectively better than any Intel processors by a really really big margin. And it is really bothering to see that happening to Windows laptop market. It is mind-sabotaging to know that if you somehow decide to get a windows laptop  there's a base model Macbook Air which has a more capable processor with better software support given the more centralized nature of Apple ecosystem  which can only extend the hardware advantage if longevity is to be taken into consideration.
1947,"Interest in RPGs comes from meaningful choices. If something is boring  it's because it lacks such choices. So inject some!  By ""meaningful"" I mean ""has relevant consequences."" ""Which shirt should I wear today"" isn't a meaningful choice in most RPGs because it affects nothing - ""which disguise should I use?"" is much more likely to be meaningful.   For travel  the nature of choice will likely depend on the level of crunch and/or detail in your travel mechanics. In a fantasy setting  travel choices might range from just ""do we take the dangerous shortcut through the mountains or just walk around?"" to the more mathematical ""how many rations can we carry with us while still being unencumbered enough to fight effectively?"".   Think of Lord of the Rings: ""Do we take the pass over Caradhras and brave the snow  or risk passing through Moria?""  Also remember that choices need not be just ""do we or do we not"" type questions. Just having an interesting thing happen provides the opportunity for meaningful choices. We don't usually frame ""goblins jump out and ambush you!"" as a decision node  but it is.   Some suggestions for your setting: Do we travel for speed or stealth? Which path should we take? Stick to the alleys or use the wider streets? There's a guard in the way - do we fight  persuade  sneak  or go around?  If there is no opportunity for interesting choices whatsoever in travel (highly unlikely)  just give some evocative descriptions of the journey and its tone  and skip to a meaningful choice.  EDIT: I also forgot: make sure the players can make these choices *informed!* They don't need perfect information obviously  but if they have no useful information  your choice is as useful as a coinflip. ""Which trade route should we follow?"" is a useless question unless you tell the players that one is shorter but controlled by the Space Mafia."
1948,Interesting  I dont think I ever thought to consider myself as the character playing in an RPG. For a long time now I have played characters where I figure out the characters psychology and play that (naturally there is part of me in every character I play) I personally find a lot of immersion in this play style as I get to figure out who the character I am playing is and how they think and react to the world around them. One of my favourite moments was in a classic RPG where I was playing a female character (I am a male) and the way that the character reacted to being hit on by a sleazy male PC  it was both in character and happened to solve the puzzle door we were trying to open.  I have found that as I took the group from a classic RPG to a more narrative RPG (Fate) that immersion went up in the sessions I ran. I don't think you have to do a lot of asking players to fill in details (I think this is mainly a stylistic choice). I didn't but I made it clear that if they had a really good idea that they wanted their character to be able to do  they could pay a Fate point and make a declaration. Example a player decides that their character wants to ply an NPC with Alcohol to get information out of them. Don't have anything marked on your character sheet  give me a Fate point and we will just say that you have a bottle of wine stashed away for a special occasion  the player gets to be their character doing something more interesting than if I had just said no. Because the transaction happened the player gets to feel like they were being clever and earned the outcome.
1949,Interesting but... I want the maximum ram the cpu will allow  so fixed is ok as long as its max. Losing a thunderbolt port for an hdmi or microsd card doesnt seem like a great feature. The amount of space those modules take is a lot  if it wasnt modular you could just fit the microsd between two thunderbolts. Modular = more bulk. Cant have a substantial upgrade like a video card. Its a good idea in theory  for some use cases  and for repair  but meh.
1950,Interesting choice given Texas still hasn't begun fixing its grid winterization and peak capacity issues. If freak weather events don't shut them down  there's good odds peak electricity demand caused by AC use during summer heatwaves will instead. ERCOT has a policy where industrial and manufacturing must power down first when the grid is running near peak capacity  and that happens every 1-3 years in the state.
1951,Interesting enough my last fwd coupe was an RSX Type S that I bought new in 2002. I'm excited to see this new Integra but it's not a car I have any interest in buying at this stage in life.  It's just good to see Acura making interesting vehicles again as they really went through a 10+ year period of utterly boring cars.
1952,Interesting read  thank you! I completely agree with most of your TLDR points!  Some thoughts:  Balancing or difficulty is probably impossible to get perfectly right. Even the simplest of games will feel really challenging to a lot of players  while some get instantly bored if they don't have to grind their mechanical skills for years. It might be wise to balance mostly around a certain type of player  make sure to define your target audience well  instead of trying to appeal to everyone!  As far as multiplayer goes  I researched my options a few months ago as I started working on a Unity multiplayer game myself. I really wouldn't touch Unitys network solutions as they are either deprecated or unfinished  but I ended up going with Mirror and I'm really happy with it. While it does have its weird quirks  it performs well and is free and open source  so you can just modify what you need  or at least find out exactly how something works to work around it.  Best of luck!
1953,Interesting to see Golden Cove scoring much higher in rendering workloads compared to Cypress Cove than Geekbench Int and Fp. Makes these early leaks which are mostly Cinebench scores seem better than what it might end up being in more general workloads.
1954,Interesting we know theyre already working on a Indian Jones game and I was hoping wed still see another Wolfenstein game. To me it makes more sense that id would helm a Quake remake and hopefully a new Quake.
1955,"Interesting. Like Blades in the Dark a lot. I wouldn't think there's much of a market for this though. Very niche.  I'm gay as hell  some of my characters are gay  but it's like.. I don't know. A ""gay"" game would be off putting? Being gay is maybe on the back end of the top 10 most important things about me  if even? Never really comes off as genuine to me when people make this tiny aspect ourselves their entire personality  or in the case  the entire theme of the game.   To each there own  I guess. Maybe just a case of me not understanding young people anymore lol or perhaps more the difference between being just gay vs. being ostentatiously 'queer.'"
1956,Interlock system its the core of cyberpunk 2020 and imo its the most realistic system for firefights. A fan modification of the system is free and you should def check it out. At least mine some ideas from it!
1957,"Is capacity equivalent to 1) performance/capability  2) literally the amount of wafers they can process a month  or 3) some combination therein?  I'm actually expecting competitive performance with Intel 7 (or even better.. otherwise they'd have been wiser to go with ""Intel 8"") - but it very well could be that the capacity on this node is fully booked for a bit.    Edit: did the title change over the last 7 hours? Wording went from ""capacity"" to ""doesn't have room"". Sounds like someone fucked up."
1958,"Is it bad I let out a ""hah"" when it showed Eugene's hand? He was just raising all the death flags he possibly could during all of his speeches in the last two episodes  I know it's supposed to be sad  but the guy was running out of flag space with how much he was collecting them all  The way they showed his death  though...man  that was some good art and directing"
1959,Is it because the LCD is mounted upside down?  I remember the OnePlus 5 having this issue. But that's an OLED screen.  Edit: a bit of dj vu.  OnePlus also said it was normal.   https://www.theverge.com/2017/6/29/15894850/oneplus-5-screen-jelly-scrolling-statement
1960,Is that a hiding hard disk ?? Nah for real though ... If you have a second drive plugged in and you're sure the connections are okay  it might just not have a formatted file system windows can recognise . Go into CMD run as admin type diskpart  Then type list disk should show up as disk 1 ( disk 0 will be the one recognised by windows/ your C drive) If it is showing there you're connections are all okay and you can just proceed to create a file system.  With list disk still open run these commands  Select disk 1  Clean  Create partition primary  Format FS = NTFS  (let this run to 100%) Assign ( this will assign the new drive a drive letter )  You should be good to go.
1961,Is that a Steelseries Arctis headset volume control? If so  Steelseries uses a proprietary 8 pin cable  that can be ordered on their site ( [https://steelseries.com/gaming-accessories/arctis-main-headset-cable](https://steelseries.com/gaming-accessories/arctis-main-headset-cable) ).
1962,Is the monitor market so small that it isn't worth companies giving a shit?   Like you think one of the big guys would just be like 'everything is shit  lets gets release some really good products at a good price and corner the market'.
1963,Is the performance and visual fidelity of an image processed with DLSS being limited by the number of Tensor Cores (and their performance) in current RTX GPUs?  For example  Nvidia's performance target for DLSS (2.0) is 2ms  and so that places a restriction on how complex the model can be  and how long it takes for a prediction based on (current) Tensor performance.  Is it reasonable to conclude that with a greater budget to retrieve a prediction (for example  doubling the threshold from 2ms to 4 ms  or doubling overall Tensor performance)  that the returned prediction (visual fidelity) could improve significantly?   Or  shortly:  1. If a larger model/more Tensor cores (to accelerate prediction) can significantly improve visual fidelity  but (current) Tensor performance doesn't allow for it within a 2ms threshold  does that mean that DLSS 2.0 has a ceiling in terms of the visual fidelity possible (based on that 2ms threshold?) 2. Assuming a larger model/faster prediction does result in increased visual fidelity  is it then reasonable to assume that RTX 4000 and/or future versions of DLSS might increase the model size and/or prediction speed?  I'm curious about the ceiling for visual fidelity based on predictions  and what implications a larger model/faster prediction speed might mean; for example  might a future version of DLSS be slower on older generations  or afford greater image fidelity  but at reduced performance.
1964,"Is there a book like the Tome of Adventure Design (Frog God Games) for sci fi? A huge system neutral book of tables to generate content for adventures and ""dungeons""? I know I could easily tweak any results to suit the setting or use something like Stars Without Number  but I was wondering if there was something out there like this."
1965,Is there a system that focuses on fantasy espionage or spycraft with magic instead of technology?   I'm being inspired by the anime Princess Principal as a media touchstone  but I can do without the Victorian/Steampunk setting. I'm vetoing Blades in the Dark before anyone recommends that.
1966,Is this still considered an issue when people are emulating old games they no longer sell? If anything  it generates interest in IP that they can make use of at any time.   Eg: I love the GBA YuGiOh! games and the only reason Im still interested is because I keep going back and rerunning it on VBA whenever the nostalgia hits. Im holding out hope that series comes back at some point and I get a new game.
1967,"Isnt that caused by lazyness in software development.   I figured it goes something like Software -> display buffer -> display hardware  and when everything is oriented the ""proper"" way  buffer is filled by software ""left to right  top to bottom""  same way display controller is reading that buffer  but when you turn the display upside down  they just flip around the buffer filling to go "" right to left  bottom to top"" while display driver still reads ""left to right  top to bottom"" causing display to read half of the old frame  half of the new frame for every frame instead of one whole new frame when it was in ""proper"" orientation.  Instead of going the long way and implementing display rotation properly  they just went simply flipping the buffer filling in driver and called it a day."
1968,Isnt this idea more like  Ive remembered something  and I can store a copy that wont degrade somewhere?  Imagine going to your kids ball game  and then you get home  and you upload everything you remember from it?  I do think  someday well have contact lenses  that act as cameras  and we can upload those to could storage.
1969,Isn't this what people used to moan and complain about with Linux  that it wouldn't put their laptop to sleep properly and so be completely useless? Now Windows doesn't do it while Linux works just fine...
1970,"It absolutely is and probably more games are played this way than face 2 face.  Good place to start is probably http://roll20.net which is one of the bigger apps / communities used to do just this. They have a fairly decent looking for group section. But there are loads of alternatives  such as ""Foundry VTT"" or ""Fantasy Grounds "".   Do a reddit search for those which will also hook you up with the relevant communities.  It's not exactly the same as in real life and groups of strangers can be unreliable  but there are some really good experiences to be had out there."
1971,"It definitely is more fun to do one thing at a time  although I do find that every other show I watch I do think ""hey  this would make a good RPG setting!"" (Carnival Row particularly feels like an RPG setting  though there is already a short document on how to adapt the Cypher system for it).  This isn't really related to RPGs so much as balancing your own personal life. Personally  I would either (a) just turn off the TV and work on RPGs for a bit  if that's what you want to do  or (b) put your notebook and pens in a box on the other side of your apartment  and put the remote control on the other side of your living room once you hit ""play""  so that there's just a teeny bit of a physical barrier stopping you from switching tasks all the time - just enough to give you time to be a bit more intentional and ask yourself if it's really what you want to do."
1972,It does not matter if I spend the day working with RPG Maker or some other game development software  If I spend quite a bit of the day  does not have to be the entire day  I am unable to sleep that night. I do try to go to bed but I am unable to sleep.  However  if I do not spend the day game developing  I can sleep just fine. Even if I play video games all day including ones that I personally made I can sleep. I just cannot sleep if I was MAKING a game that day.    I tried Googling the issue but only results pertaining to unable to sleep after gaming came up. I never had that issue. It is only when I make games that I cannot sleep.  So I was wondering if anybody else has this while game developing?   Anybody know why I cannot sleep when I spend the day making a game?
1973,It exists but only in one or two vehicles - heated windshield along the wipers. (Same idea as the back window with the defrosting wires)  For those wondering wtf - when it snows  it builds up on the wipers and turns to ice and renders them useless.
1974,"It goes without saying  though  all those other comments included...but he does have prior game experience. At least in the latest video ""The mistake every new game developer makes"" he mentions how before he began YouTube  some 10+ years ago  he had tried making games and failed. So maybe he never first hand put his research and knowledge to use (which came afterward) but it does mean he tried.  &#x200B;  Besides  now I'm watching on at his series to see if he can apply what he's taught thus far. It's always a learning experience."
1975,it got interested because of my friends who usually understand more about cars than me. Im not the brightest mind when it comes to it but they taught me a lot. From time to time I read something on the internet about cars like Top gear news  drivertical or whatever. also I recommend r/shittycarmod or r/IdiotsInCars if you like to laugh.
1976,It had a worse GPU than the surface book 3  an increasing outdated quad core CPU  and in my opinion ugly design. No doubt the price will also be astronomical. All in return for a hinge mechanism thats really no more useful than a normal 360 convertible.
1977,It has a very strong opening couple of chapters imo but it starts to kind of fall off around varnhold. That bring said i loved varnhold  and the ending of the game itself was pretty damn good. But i took me like 200+ hours to get there. Wrath of the Righteous seems better so far (characters are dope as fuck) but i havent beaten it yet.
1978,It has light rpg elements  but it's just a bloated bland open world monstrosity. If you already like the series it will probably appeal to you  if you're looking for an actual rpg steer clear.   Past the Ezio games the series is a very mixed bag. People mostly like it for the world space  not any rpg parts. Walking around shiny and pretty versions of Egypt or Greece is fun  that's about it.
1979,"It has to be so small that if feels ridiculous. If it doesn't feel too small it's too big. My very first game was literally ""momoko"" on iOS and this one was already too big for a first project.  You have to look at it this way. No matter what size your game is: you will always learn something new when building it. That experience will feed into your next game (that is maybe just 5% bigger).   And every small game you build is actually a new addition into your portfolio.  The good thing about ridiculous small games are. While you develop them you get new ideas you want to add. But instead of adding them you put them into your backlog. They don't belong in your V1.   Once you reached the finish line of V1. You will have:  1. A finished game 2. A backlog full of ideas to make it better/bigger 3. The choice wether you actually want to implement these ideas or move onto the next small game.  Hope that helps "
1980,It involves combat  but Final Fantasy 9 is very G-rated and kid friendly. It's also a great entry point into jrpgs in general  especially for kids.  Its available on almost every modern console as well as lots of older ones too  for cheap.
1981,It is a shitty situation and you're right to feel bad about it. You'll work your way up back again so try to turn your pain into motivation. It is a good time right now to find another  better paying job  have you looked into that?
1982,It is a very easy choice between those two.   Do you know what a saving throw is? An ability modifier? Armor class? Attack Bonus (Thac0)? Spell Slots? Vancian casting? Move Actions? Full Actions? Free Actions?  If yes go with Pathfinder. The game is much more rule heavy  coming from the Pathfinder ruleset which is derived from the exceedingly complicated 3.5 ruleset. It also implements most of the complexities from that system. If you do not know the basics starting the game is like staring down a cliff.  If some of those terms are shaky for your go with Solasta. It implements a slimmed down version of the much easier and less complex 5e ruleset. Anyone can probably pick it up and figure it out  it was a specific goal to make DnD more approachable with 5e.  Pathfinder is a munchkin's dream  Solasta a good time for everyone.
1983,It is not complete yet  but Starforged is gonna have some very neat oracles to generate content for the galaxy. Recently  [the creator posted a teaser of the creature oracle](https://twitter.com/ShawnTomkin/status/1448079226150682625).
1984,"It is only hard until you get some experience.  Eventually you hit that wall of experience and then it's incredibly easy. It still takes a lot of work (time and/or money) but it becomes very easy.  Speaking about game development pipeline  game programming  etc. But I am sure this also applies to game art  game design  level design  etc. I just never had that same ""wall"" with those  bc you can be successful making levels  art  and gameplay (even if it isnt good  you still achieve success.)  Game development as a whole and software engineering (game programming as a whole) is that super hard --> super easy wall you eventually break through.  Enginedev or using an engine is also different than those two types. It becomes more about building components and assets you can reuse. For example  figuring out the art to game engine pipeline for your project. Once you figure that out and set it up  all future projects can have that. Once you setup authoritative multiplayer or some input system  you can reuse it too.  In gamedev as a 1ma  there are...  * Walls you must break through  making hard into easy. * Skills you must develop from low quality to higher quality. * Systems you need to build and add to your developer toolkit."
1985,It looks like the majority is a block  so the minority has lost out. In most democracies  unless there are rules to protect the minority  the results are unfair.  Forcing 5-5 is going to cause bad blood. No one likes to be told what to do. So just ignore it and run groups of two different sizes.  If the smaller group wants to recruit  then the larger group has no say in that. Since there is a split  they don't get a vote.  One thing you can do is enjoy the smaller group. 4 players get more time in the spotlight than do 6. That table is more likely to have the better experience  especially with RP. Usually everyone at the table will have more fun.  And remember that college clubs often have high turnover. People drop out during exams  schedule conflicts with the start of a new semester  graduation  etc. Players will always be in flux. Whatever seems ideal now will be crap in 2-3 months
1986,It lowers piston travel distance and speed  reducing the amount of force required to stop the piston at the end of each stroke.  This means you can rev higher without exceeding the tensile strength of the rod bolts.  It also helps to reduce rod angle which makes force transfer to the crank for effecient.  Lowering piston speed also helps to avoid power loss from the piston outrunning the flame front.
1987,It makes me sad. It reminds me of Todd Howard taking a franchise too smart for his smooth brain and turning it into dogshit  and making it worse as time goes on  even when a third party studio shows him how to do better.  Fallout   fo 2: yes Nv: yes 3: no 4: oh lord  no 76: Todd Howard must pay for this.
1988,It makes sense if your character thinks it makes sense  and it doesnt if your character thinks it doesnt.   This is clearly just as much about feelings as it is logic for this character  right? You cant math out matters of the heart.
1989,"It might be helpful if when you do find a group  that you ask if roleplay in third person mode is okay with the group. People often presume RP in first person mode (speaking as their characters do  word-for-word  mostly)  but some players prefer to do it third person style.  For example  when meeting someone.  * First person RP style: ""Well met! I am Sir Gravain  a humble wandering knight. And who might you be?""  * Third person RP style:""Sir Gravain introduces himself and asks the stranger what their name is.""  That won't fix every issue a shy person will face when gaming  but one of my players struggles with it at our table  and this is their solution."
1990,It might be helpful to explain how tyre sizes work. The current passenger tyre sizing format (I wont bother to explain off-road  etc.) is width/aspect+ply+diameter.  (There can be more information like load and speed rating but were just talking about size now.)  My trucks 265/70R17 tires have a tread that is 265mm wide  and the height of the sidewall is 70% of that  so 186mm. The R means radial  as opposed to e.g. bias ply. Then youve got the wheel diameter  17. (Yes  the sizing mixes millimetres  percent  and inches.) So  the total diameter is roughly 17 + 2 * 186mm = 804mm. (This ignores loading and inflation. The true effective rolling diameter is usually a bit less  maybe 95-96% of the theoretical number.)  I can replace the tires  or tires plus rims  with any combination that keeps the correct final diameter  within a few percent. For example  if I wanted slightly narrower tires for winter use (to cut through snow and slush better) I might install 245/75 tires on the same 17 rims. These would have a sidewall height of 245 * 75% = 184mm  and a total theoretical diameter of 800mm. This setup would be 800/804 = 99% of the nominal size  so my speedo/odo would read about 1% higher than reality.  Most people will accept maybe 4-5% error  but beyond that you probably want to reprogram your PCM with the correct calibration factor.  That help?
1991,it might be worth playing something totally different to what you normally enjoy. A vehicle simulator? A beat 'em up? Some old arcade games? A horror themed game? (I find horror games give me a nice break from RPGs) You'll be giving your brain a new challenge and your hands a new experience to adjust to.  Or just take a break from gaming in general. Do some more exercise or learn a new software  do some creative writing or drawing. Take up gardening or give yourself some sort of project to work on. Your games will still be there when/if you want to go back to them.
1992,It really depends on the combat system IMO. In Fire Emblem Path of Radiance the Laguz (were-wolf like characters) were only useful in battle when they transformed. That  on top of a biological Stat that would fluctuate during battle  affecting hit chance  made me wonder why build such a clunky system in the first place.  In that game in particular  those 2 systems didn't affect the game in normal difficulty at all. They became just minor nuisances.
1993,It really depends on what you're after. If you want the players to feel empowered  and like they're mowing through enemies  then monsters should probably have low HP  so they go down in one to two hits. If you instead want the players to feel like they're going up against something that's far stronger than they are  make it considerably tougher than the player characters. Will the monster be alone  or tag along with others? Facing 10 damage sponges is no fun  but if you only have a single enemy you probably want it to be able to survive a full round of attacks from the players.  &#x200B;  Basically before looking at just health  you need to consider what your monster is  and what role it has in the game. You also need to consider other damage mitigation methods  like dodging  armour or even things that might take players temporarily out of action or keep them busy.
1994,"It really does feel like the days of overclocking being worth bothering with are numbered. There just isn't that much headroom on anything anymore and things are trending towards there being none. It seems like we are right around the corner from everything being pushed to the max out of the box to the degree that you're already past the point of diminishing returns on the perf per watt scale so shoving more power into things just adds a bunch of heat without much benefit. In my opinion this will really only leave cooling as a source of ""getting more perf"" out of parts because cooler generally means higher sustained boost clocks  but with water you're already about as good as your going to get without going sub-ambient so there's not too much room for anything super exciting to happen there either.   I think this all sucks for enthusiasts that love squeezing more perf out of the parts they bought  but should be better for anyone else who never felt like fooling with overclocking and whatnot in the first place. I don't think it's necessarily a bad thing to have your hardware run as fast as your power budget and cooling capacity allow without doing anything  but it does take away a nice bit of fun I've enjoyed for many years."
1995,It really wasn't until I got my first car that I got interested in cars. I couldn't have cared less beforehand haha.   Though I'm the type of person that gets engrossed in the stuff I do so it tracks.   Also I've always loved travelling  photographing  and exploring new places so cars let you get there in speed and comfort and it just goes hand in hand with my other hobbies. Plus they're just fun to drive
1996,It seems every project one works on for an extended period of time teaches some new aspects of game development. I'd like to hear what are your latest learnings in the context of your current game project. I'm gonna share some of mine:  The game that I'm working on is a small unit tactics game called [Para Bellum - Hold the Line](https://store.steampowered.com/app/1772920/Para_Bellum__Hold_the_Line/) (Link to the Steam page in case you want to check it out for context). While it is not the first game that I've released  nor it's my first professional game project  it is the first game project that I'm making from start to finish on my own that I'm planning to release commercially.   **Level design:** This is something that I've never done properly in a game project before. I've made some fun maps for other games and made some creations that barely pass as levels for my previous projects. For the current game I'm working on  I wanted to make 15 unique levels which all should provide some unique challenges and opportunities for a player. Working on the levels showed me how little experience I have in level design. Fortunately during the journey  I've been learning what works and what does not in the context of my game. I would definitely be interested to do more level design work in the future since learning the art has been a pleasure.  **Balancing single player content:** I'm planning to release the game with a campaign mode. As one could imagine  campaign mode needs to increase in difficulty and variety of challenges as the player progresses. This has been something that has taken me a lot of time. Just figuring out how to approach balancing something like that has been a challenge. After few weeks of working I figured what kinds of debug/dev tools I need in order to do test runs on campaign missions and how to balance individual missions as a part of a more overarching campaign. I have learned a lot  but it is very clear to me that I have long ways to go still to master this art. Early player feedback will be worth gold in this regard.  **PR/Marketing/Communications:** For my previous games  I've pretty much just made a trailer  uploaded it on my Youtube channel and put the game out and let people find it on their own. Maybe posted on social media or reddit about it  but I haven't done any proper marketing so far. This time I started marketing early and in addition to sharing screenshots and trailers  I've been very active on Twitter and even made TikTok and Instagram accounts just to try the waters. What I learned was that the process of marketing is very iterative. You put out a screenshot/gif/video and see how people react to it. You put out another and compare results. Then you can optimize based on what you learned. I suppose that is partially why it is so important to start marketing early. One thing that didn't surprise me  but is still worth mentioning is that finding your audience is very difficult in the saturated indie game business.
1997,"It seems like at least 50%+ of the time it is always a fight with a dealership to get warranty repair work done  especially if it is a major repair. Just google through forums over the years and you can read all the horror stories of ppl with warranty nightmares.  Generally  does management encourage their techs to push back on the warranty claims or make up excuses i.e. ""we cant replicate the issue""  ""we cant warranty this because it looks like you abused the car""  etc. Do a lot of techs on their own initiative push back because of the fact that warranty work doesnt pay near as well as service work? Or is it a combination of both to some degree?  Granted i know not all warranty denials are invalid  but it seems like a lot of the time dealers are just trying to get out of performing warranty work. Many valid warranty claims seem to get rejected."
1998,It sounds like you have somehow become self-conscious? Maybe Im wrong. Shy is a term we use to simplify very complex and intense feelings we have about ourselves. You dont describe much what you are experiencing but thats what it sounds like to me based on my own experience.
1999,It sounds like you should consider playing other ARPG's in the style of PoE as they tend to be the games with most focus on skill trees.   Last Epoch(every skill has it's own skill tree)  Grim Dawn and Chronicon would be some of the go to choices for me.
2000,It sounds like you've tried it yourself and it's not going to work.  For now you can still focus on the programming and game design side both of which are under valued skills.  Maybe try making a simple roguelike  side scroller  or puzzle game.  But if you really want to do 3D you should go through learnOpenGL.com which will help you understand how 3D graphics work  I can pretty much guarantee you that you'll be able to get 3D working on your hardware if you implement it directly in OpenGL.
2001,It sounds to me like you are not being proactive enough in finding group members. I do not mean this as an insult.  Right now especially  people just do not respond to passive requests for games. I live in a fairly large city and have posted advertisements to simply teach people 5e on meetup  facebook  and at least 2 different store's pages. Places that actively run 5e mind you  and ill get a couple people a month at most. And most of them end up dropping from further games.  You are having a social problem  not a dnd one. Try meeting new people in general  through board game nights  mtg  etc  and THEN try to get them to play dnd.
2002,It takes about 18 minutes to get past the typical Steve rant about proprietary parts. As if 99% of the people that buy a prebuilt are suddenly going to have a change of heart and will start upgrading and replacing components as opposed to discarding the entire thing  standard parts or not  and then buying another prebuilt. Steve and the enthusiasts here are not the typical market for prebuilts   Not everyone knows how to or thinks swapping out CPUs and power supplies is fun like we do  maybe you just want to buy a computer that works and plays modern games and do other things with your time.
2003,It takes EU to tame companies  I look forward to more universal standards of connecting/charging phones. Without such actions like that  the current situation with dozen of charging standards and 3 types of connections will persist.
2004,It was a struggle for me  my first car was a hand me down that my parents had ever since I was 4 years old. Unfortunately  my parents weren't great at maintaining it  so it had its fair share of issues and was a bucket o' rust.   I got a good deal on my Civic and without space for the RAV4  it had to go. :(  My current car's leaps and bounds better  but I still miss the damn thing. I'd buy that crappy RAV4 back if I could  but I'm sure it's been junked by now.
2005,It was my birthday and I wanted to run a TMNT game. I made it way too easy  but learned a lot. Now  running Tales of Equestria is a snap. Be honest but confident in your rulings and don't forget that if you're having fun  that's the most important thing.
2006,It was my first anime and I can't complain  it actually made me more into Watanabe (creator of this and few other great series) than into anime in general at the time. So if you fall in love  you instantly know where to go next.
2007,It was really irritating when this happened in Wasteland 2.  Out in the middle of no where and one of my core NPCs leaves the team  so suddenly my team is facing being encumbered....and I can't stand moving slower due to encumbrance.
2008,It was to be expected  if you want an improving system then the software lifecycle is going to cost you. Personally don't care for self driving since I will never trust it with other driver on the roads.
2009,It wasnt much of an issue before now it is. And Apple has the nerve to tell people that this is normal.  Imagine if BMW came out with an updated 3 series and people found that it handled like absolute shit  then BMW said that this is normal  despite previous models not having this problem.  People need to wake up and realize that Apple just cut corners and theyre trying to deflect from the obvious problem it caused.
2010,It will be an interesting cpu with the big little design. I'm interested to see if extreme overclockers buy it or skip it. On the one side it should be a great single or up to 8 core benchmarks but shouldnt threaten amdsulticore scores. The other question will be if the memory controller takes a hit
2011,It wouldnt be in reverse.   The entrance would just be the initial step of escaping  and so on. None of it requires that you be going into a place rather than out.  So  if theyre in a jail cell guarded by a guy with a revolver  thats the entrance and guardian. Then they need to get past a code-locked door to get out of the cell block  thats your puzzle. If they then discover the prison is on the moon  thats your trick. Then they have to fight through a bunch of guys and steal a shuttle  thats your climax. Reward is freedom and a stolen shuttle.  The five rooms are a narrative arrangement. They dont imply any spatial relationship.
2012,It'll click - I think you're probably forgetting the trials you had learning the stuff you already know  and comparing what you don't know about games with what you already do know with web development. Stuff you know always seems simpler than stuff you don't.  I've been making games for 20 years and a lot of the things you consider 'so hard' are probably as easy to me as the simpler elements of web development are to you. And I have the very opposite situation when I'm trying to do web development  even though I did web development for a profession before I started making games (admittedly when it was a lot simpler and a lot of the cool tech didn't exist) now I hit wall after wall and it feels just such a mountain of stuff I don't know I'll walk into traps at every opportunity.  Just stick with it  watch tutorials  read  learn  and at some point whatever's really standing in your way will click and you'll be fine. There's always more to learn however.  That all said  I won't lie and say that the indie dev scene is as easy to make a living from as web development  but that's not all about the development but the sheer competitiveness of the industry.
2013,Itll click eventually  just keep at it!  Also coming from a bit of gamedev myself  its good to know web will be easier to learn and make a career from  as thats the path Id like to take!  The career part of gamedev is probably the most difficult.
2014,It's 26 episodes long so you can binge it this weekend if you want. Unlike say Dragonball with Hundreds of episodes.   The Dub is also fantastic so if you don't want to read subtitles this is one anime even sub purists are like yeah it's pretty good.   It's also very episodic  so it's not like every episode is part of the overall mystery plot line. So they get to do really fun episodes that aren't part of some grand mystery like Stranger Things or Westworld.   I'd say it's a great start.
2015,It's a bad Assassin's Creed game  a bad open world game and not a very good RPG either.  I feel like modern Ubisoft games (post 2014/15) are only worth playing if you have nothing else to do. Ubisoft are the kings of mediocrity.
2016,It's a contract  a legally binding agreement between you and someone else.  Dont wanna get sued?  Don't break the contract you agreed to.  If you didn't read it.  Don't agree to contracts you didn't read first otherwise... and I believe this is the legal terminology but IANAL.  &#x200B;  Fuck around and find out
2017,Its a lot of fun.  20 minute sessions seem to last forever and then are over all too soon. Just when you think youre driving to the limit of the cars ability  let your instructor take a lap or two.  You will be humbled.  The brain can only handle so much input.  My guess is that I missed half of the instructions.
2018,It's a nice feature that almost no one will use not even content creators as the file size will just be too big and likely the quality will not be up to power with a proper camera. It will also fill up the phone storage and take AGES to get off the phone due to the fine choice of stilling using Lightning connector over USB C.
2019,It's a poll for my own benefit and my group. What do people enjoy? I am with a group that only ever played d&d.  It's anonymous. Full url for google forms. No trackers.  I didn't imagine there would be so much suspicion for a simple 5 question poll. This is not an account created 5 days ago for an ad agency or something like that....
2020,Its a real struggle. What helped me was the bigger picture that there were other cars I wanted to experience and I couldnt own them all. You know what? You will ALWAYS have the memories. Detail it really well while you still have it and give the car the best send off you can.
2021,Its a simple swap as long as you buy all the right harnesses  DIN kits  and a head unit compatible with your car. Crutchfield support is really helpful  and honestly Car Toys prices for doing this in 2-3 hours are solid.   NOTE: if you have a backup camera  many new head units require that you integrate a new camera  as theyre not compatible with the factory camera. Be sure to verify this. Learned the hard way on my 2013 Altima.
2022,It's a very different game. It's a lot more like Kotor than Mass Effect. It's not that it's bad--I certainly enjoyed it--but it's got more of an old school vibe. The combat isn't really action oriented and it can be a lot more tactical (though if that's not your thing you can usually get by setting up some basic tactics for your squad and then just controlling yourself). It's got a silent protagonist  which can seem like a bigger change than it actually is.  Some random quick tips:  *Archery kind of sucks unless you're playing Awakening. Then it gets pretty OP. * All the Origins are pretty fun. It doesn't take too much time to play them all and see what fits. Or replay when you're finished * Shape shifting sounds cool but is pretty weak in practice unless you mod the game  I don't know. Guess I thought I'd have more than that after 500 hours invested in that game. That I don't I think is a sign that almost everything is viable and playable and fun. If anything that's my problem--of those 500 hours  all but like 20 of them were replaying the first half of the game over and over because I thought of other cool things to try
2023,Its about time I get a new car. Not because I need one  but Ive been searching for a while and found a couple good deals I want to snag up. I consider myself a pretty sentimental person  and Ive had my first car for quite a few years. I keep trying to tell myself I could keep it but it just doesnt make sense financially. Im definitely going to miss it  but I know its time to let go.   How did you guys deal with letting go of your first car?
2024,Its actually Dragon Age: Origins. The Ultimate Edition with all the dlc is almost perfect as a crpg (or at least a remake probably wouldn't change much). DAO is already a spiritual successor to an entire generation of CRPGs capitalizing on what mad them great.
2025,It's adaptive sync  and what it does is it changes the refresh rate of your monitor to match that of whatever's playing  so instead of 40 hz content running on 60hz  the monitor adapts to run it at 40hz. It reduces screen tearing and is helpful but you can live without it.
2026,It's all about scope.  It would take you a lifetime to become an expert in all of the various specialties required to program a modern game (graphics  sounds  music  networking  AI  physics  etc.) so the key is to take smaller bites and learn a little more each day.  Scale back if you find yourself wanting to match what it took 150 programmers five years to make.  We made plenty of fun games in the 80's with just one or two programmers  but our scope was way small compared even to modern mobile games.  It is hard  but the challenge should also make it enjoyable  at least that's my perspective.
2027,Its all talk to discourage people from leaking shit. They aint going to do anything except send cease and desist orders. They Especially aint going to ban people from the full launch. Leakers might deserve it for breaking a contract but its not profitable to sue a random YouTuber. If it was a huge name then they might see some cash.
2028,Its always a bit surprising which cars age well.  When the e92 BMWs came out back in 07  I was totally floored by the design. But now in 2021  I cant even look at them anymore. For me  e46 aged much better than the e90.  Generally speaking  I think cars that have a consistent and simple styling on top of great proportions age well. F Type  S550 Mustang  G-Class.  Cars that are overstyled interpretations of the current Zeitgeist in design generally dont age well. Id put current BMWs  Supra  C8  several Acuras in this category.  But honestly I think its very hard to say how modern cars will age.
2029,It's an absolute classic but keep in mind that it's an episodic series  meaning that every episode is mostly a self contained mini-story rather than a complex plot that develops throughout the series. If you're fine with that then go for it.
2030,"It's an interesting game  because the first chapter is different for all race selections. There are two for elf (city and wood elf)  there are two dwarf (commoner and noble)  and Human noble. But Mages get their own start.  All races can be all things  but elves have a little bit more mana than humans for mages  while humans are a bit more robust. Dwarves arguably make the best non-mages because they get  a small chance to ignore spell damage.  My advice is to try a few - they're all good stories  and stick with the first on that resonates with you. I like City Elf and Noble Dwarf the most. Each one gives you a slightly different experience in the rest of the game. Example: the human start involves someone irritating you  and while all players meet him later  it's extra special when you know him.   If you play on the ""normal"" difficulty  it's hard to mess up so bad it's unplayable. My only counter argument to ""starting mage"" is because each character gets to join two advanced classes - but you have to find and unlock them first. The good mage options take some time to unlock  and they can dramatically change the game experience for you. On a second playthrough  these options STAY unlocked  so maybe hold off.  My first play through was city elf and I enjoyed the crap out of it  even though they're probably the weakest class for rogues."
2031,"It's an interesting question.as the article is unclear on how the grid is instantiated. Here is my interpretation.  When that part of the map is loaded (the player moves into a grass field)  you create a grid that's agnostic to the grass entities. For example  maybe create a cell for each world unit (x0  y0 to x1  y1 would be 1 cell). Then as each burnable entity is loaded  find what cell it belongs to and mark that cell as ""Burnable"". Then when a damage event happens to a grass entity (bullet or flame thrower)  find the cell it's part of  and reduce the cells hit points. When the cell is out of hit points  it starts to burn causing damage to adjacent cells. As it burns the entities inside can be replaced with burnt  non Burnable grass  and the cell is also marked as such."
2032,It's because you're in the U.S.  Maybe get a VPN and set yourself as being in the UK. Then you should be more easily be able to search for English language sites for parts suppliers.   Not a BMW guy but from a quick search there's everything from well established top end players like AC Shnitzer  Harmann and Alpina to independents like Lichfield  M-Style  Performance M  or M Power Cars then general parts stores that sell mods for lots of brands likeDemon Tweaks or general parts stores that sell some mods like carparts4less or the German based Autodoc.   Just be wary international supply chains are a mess at the moment so shipping will likely to take a long and be expensive.
2033,It's been a while  but for my oneshots  I usually had some Singaporeans  Taiwanese  Hongkong...ese?  Koreans  Brits  and Eastern Europeans  mostly Poles. Sometimes North American Night Owls  but since most of my games were scheduled for something like 8am UTC  those were few and far between.
2034,It's been very good but I'm primarily interested in what is coming  always looking forward.   I can buy a 5950x now  it's great and powerful but what can I look forward to.  What will the 7950x do  love to know.
2035,"It's called decision fatigue. [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Decision\_fatigue](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Decision_fatigue)  I do this with my ""too many hobbies"" problem. I spend a buncha time setting up multiple board games 75% of the way  build some tables 50%  and then burn out and achieve 0%.  There's a lot of resources online  just hit google and read up  try to use more reputable sources when you do so. Or if you feel it's too negatively impacting your life  get professional help  even if it's just an anxiety help group or something."
2036,It's definitely interesting from a mathematical standpoint  but I don't see what this would add to playing an RPG. At best  it's just another RPG with specialty dice (like Genesys) and at worst  it'd be confusing for players.
2037,Its definitely seems like a major component has failed. The computer is starting attempting to power up and equalize and probably overdrawing and then shutting down to protect itself. Something probably in the power delivery is not stabilizing properly. Check The motherboard and video card. Try removing the video card and see if it will start.
2038,It's easier said than done  but find yourself a mentor. Find someone who has been in it longer than you  and offer to help or make a small game. Don't lean on them for every step  but for when you feel you hit that wall. Even some kind of game dev discord could be a fill in for a mentor if its active enough. Tutorials exist for almost everything you could need  the hard part is putting what you need into searchable words.
2039,its easily possible. just look it up. whatever car you want to look up  type big blower or big turbo or 7 second and then the cars name  for example ;   big turbo c4 corvette. 7 second foxbody mustang. big blower camaro.
2040,Its funny seeing people hate on Apple here. When they introduced Lightning in 2012  when all their competitors were using micro-usb and they were criticized for not using it because it was the standard
2041,It's incredibly difficult  people don't realize the shear amount of effort it takes. Probably some of the most difficult projects you can attempt are video games; even if you rely on existing engines it's still super hard.
2042,It's interesting getting another take on this. I used to be a web developer and switched to game dev and found it to be a much smoother experience! I used to struggle frequently with business logic in web applications  but game logic and incorporating my skills in 3D modeling and animations has been a breeze. Different strokes for different folks I guess.
2043,Its interesting seeing a blog post that was posted in California calling it football instead of soccer. Obviously it was a global announcement and most people in the world call it football. Still  when you hear something coming from America  its odd to not hear it called soccer.
2044,It's just brilliant how Subaru manages to keep the legacy of it's rally destroying ancestors alive in it's current range as well  unlike some other companies that just make bad cars and slap legendary nameplates onto them.
2045,"It's kind of like how to win at fighting: take your stance  defend against attacks  and strike the opponent's openings until they succumb.   Step into the ring with your winning technique scribbled onto a post-it and you'll end up flattened. Step in front of a computer with your boss fight tips and most people will probably just learn that they don't know how to make music or animate  let alone build up a game to the point where they can give a boss lots of health at all.   Still  I was watching an interview with a Olympic gold medalist in boxing and she mentioned how she wasn't interested in coaching because she didn't know how to put technique into words. Her strategy is to wait for an opening  and then she goes ""shu!"" with her fist and the opponents head goes ""paka!"" .The interviewer joked that it resembled a legendary baseball player describing how he goes ""shu!"" with the bat and the ball goes zoom.  Those are the people who get to say ""you make a boss fight by slamming an epic track on a big baddy that has some cool moves before going Splurggh when you hit its weak point!"" Everyone else gets to train for a few years trying to figure out what they actually mean."
2046,"It's like cooking  if you can make a great spaghetti bolognese  that doesn't mean you can immediately cook a steak. It's still ""ingredients + prep + heat + time"" but there's so much muscle memory  instinct  and experience around making something good  you're gonna have to keep at it to be able to do it effortlessly.  And just like cooking  the best way to get better is to do the whole thing again and again. That's why the advice is often ""go to jams and make tons of tiny games"" because if you want to learn how to cook steak  you need to buy a ton of steaks  and cook one every night for a week. Not create one big steak dinner for 7 people all at once."
2047,"It's nice  but considering the new '22 Jetta is even nicer AND gets 43mpg AND comes with a manual AND an actual 4cyl instead of the Focus' stupid 3cyl....  Edit: I looked at the other pics  I see the car pictured has a manual. It's nice inside but that infotainment iPad they glued on is just TOO big now. I feel like ~8"" is a happy medium for any infotainment screen. And for the love of all that is holy  integrate it INTO the dash instead of propping it up on top like an afterthought."
2048,It's not a *big* issue  but I wouldn't say it's a non-issue either. It's not obviously visible unless scrolling back-and-forth in portrait where the text on the screen wobbles up and down alternatively on either side  but I'm not sure it's return-worthy (partly also because Samsung  Microsoft  or any other company can't be bothered making high-end tablets at a relatively small size  so there's no other option ).     Sometimes  though  it looks weird when screen text kinks to one side when you're quickly scrolling through a PDF or something.
2049,Its not a collector or anything special to anyone... but I love my BMW n54 motor! Its in a 2008 e90 335xi with almost 200k miles logged by me.  I graduated to that BMW from my fully built '92 Eclipse GSX awd turbo 4g63 motor. I loved that car as well. I sold/gave away this with 250k miles on the clock and running well!  I'm actually disappointed with my most recent addition of a 2018 Tesla P3D+ the car has no sole and brings no joy to drive like my past cars. A waste of $80k but I will earn that money back over time since I have Free Unlimited Super charging for life (a rare perk).  I will probably wait till about 2030 and see what kind of manual transmission import tuner cars come out in the future to keep as my next vehicle in the stable.
2050,It's not about the idea  it's about the implementation. You can have the greatest game idea if the game don't work as a whole.  Since you just begin your journey  make a lot of prototypes  male ridiculously small finished games. Dream big but start small. Good luck!
2051,It's not actually bad  because in the manga...  I don't care if the manga is better. I don't care if the anime cut stuff from the manga. I'm not reading the manga  I'm watching the anime  and a shit anime doesn't get better because of a good manga.
2052,It's not an issue  it's a feature.  Jelly scrolling makes your average text way more fun and lively. Have a laugh and fill with joy while all your favorite letters and punctuation marks wiggle around before your very eyes :3
2053,It's not an RPG but my go to game for listening to audiobooks is snowrunner. It's an open world off-road simulator driving game that you can get new trucks in and upgrade said trucks. It's relaxing to just be driving through harsh environments and listening to books. Probably not what you are looking for but figured I would mention it.
2054,Its not difficult at all. I just beat it last week. There are challenging moments but the key to playing Nocturne is buffs debuffs and having strong demons. You also have to have a good understanding of the press turn system which is actually easy to understand
2055,It's not flying if you have no control over where it's going. That's just drifting in the wind.  Also this thing is not going to have enough power to transmit to any large distance. What is it going to do with the data and how do you recover it?  It's probably also not going to be functional in any rough weather conditions like rain or very strong winds.  I doubt it's going to be any more useful for population surveillance than the means they already have (your phones  activity online  street cameras).
2056,It's not good for the car  and when you inevitably end up with a check engine light due to consistently putting the incorrect fuel into the tank  you can also kiss your warranty goodbye.  Fuelling a higher end car is the least of your worries. If you're sweating over the difference between regular and premium unleaded  how are you going to insure and service the thing  including replacing consumables?  I hope you weren't planning on just dropping and replacing the oil at the local K-Mart discount chain service centre on an expensive brand new car.
2057,It's not impossible to break out of; I currently GM weekly games of Traveller and Dark Sun 2E AD&D  with occasional one-shots of weirder systems like Dread  Joints n Jivers  and kill puppies for satan. The trick is GM'ing; it's a rare resource  and folks will jump through hoops to get it; even if that means taking a risk learning and playing a new system that might suck or not last more than a few sessions. By me having the reputation of being a decent GM  those fears are mitigated somewhat. If you're a player asking a D&D DM (especially one you don't know too well) to pick up a totally new system and run it for you  they'll probably pass. This friction lends the hobby to its current state of stagnation. I personally think the solution is a renormalization of open tables and pick-up games (as opposed to long-form campaigns). Not all systems lend themselves well to this  though.
2058,It's not just physical manufacturing.  A friend who works as an IP supplier has been having a terrible time trying to fill positions that require Cadence/Synopsys EDA tool knowledge and coding. Basically ended up hiring fresh grads and will spend a lot of time training them on the tools. Cheaper than hiring EDA tool users and trying to teach them how to code.  Basically the company will be asking more money for IP to cover the cost  and they're expecting this to be happening across the industry. Every big tech company and stealth startup is trying to start their in-house chip teams and the subsequent hiring spree has drained the labor pool. The only way to get fully qualified employees is to snipe them from other companies and those companies are offering retention incentives i.e. a big block of vesting stock.  tl;dr: $$$$$
2059,"It's not my hometown  but ""East Texas University"" is set in the sort of area I grew up in - Rural Texas.  I find that it's a LITTLE over the top  but the heart is there. The people who wrote it obviously grew up behind the pine curtain.    What's funny was - when I was coming up  you never heard anyone from a city speak with a Texas drawl.  It just wasn't done.  People thought it made you sound like an uneducated redneck.  But I listen to the kids in my daughter's high school and one out three sounds like the just got in off the range.  They are proud of what makes them different and have a love of their heritage.  It makes the the heart of Texas that beats in my chest grow three sizes  I tell you what."
2060,It's not overly difficult  but it is hard compared to most mainstream jRPGs  no question about that. You don't need guides to beat the game though. It could be tedious too depending on your taste in games. It's pretty much a dungeon crawler  meaning 95% of the time you'll be running around corridors and fighting mobs.  It's still a great game  but I'd barely call it a jRPG to begin with. If you like dungeon crawlers  it's a fun game. If you're looking for a RPG  I'd probably look elsewhere or approach the game with very open mind.
2061,It's not poor balancing. The design of the game must allow everyone (well  a large part of the possible audience) to be able to complete the game - if you're a power player doing every quest  efficiently clearing out areas and picking up every bit of expensive loot to sell  the game will inevitably get trivial fast. When you're a superman kitted out with top tier equipment even the toughest enemies are not a challenge.   But. People who want to only play the main quests without killing every mob or leveling up every skill or looting everything to sell should be able to complete it too. They are the main reason the games seem easy to you and it's a perfectly legit reason. There shouldn't be impossible progress gates that can't be overcome without grinding for skill points or equipment.   Gameplay-wise I enjoy the first third of any rpg the most  since after that I can take on everything it can throw at me and the challenge is gone. I like seeing what I can accomplish as a scrawny little shit. Early game when my skills are not up there yet  quests are still at least somewhat challenging and I may not cover some skill check requirements  that's my jam. Once I get up there in power  I play for the quests and characters  but combat becomes a timewasting nuisance.  Since you wanted some examples  try Kingdom Come: Deliverance. You'll be able to steamroll opponents one on one if you're high level  but if ambushed by a group (or blow your cover when stalking one trying to pick them off) they can still mess you up good. Even the best plate armor can't make you a demigod if you're being wailed on by 4 dudes from every side.
2062,Its not really a band anime  more of a drama that happens to involve some bands  but NANA remains my favorite anime. Cant recommend high enough. Feel free to skip the first episode  it will be shown in its entirety later on.  Also note the 3 episode rule doesnt apply. It gets really good starting with episode 8
2063,It's not totally unfathomable  once I rolled a character with nothing lower than 16 on *every* stat.  I asked the DM if I could re-roll as having a character with no weakness would be absolutely zero fun.  I would just say keep your eyes open.
2064,Its not traditional to JRPGs but I still go back to the Chloromancer from RIFT. There really arent enough clever new takes on a healing class and this version has always been a fan favorite of mine. It combines my two favorite kinds of play styles: healing and ranged magical dps.   The crux of the class is that by damaging mobs with their spells  they are able to siphon the mobs health and transfers it either directly to the tank or split up amongst the group. In addition  they can curse the mobs to allow a certain amount of damage that the group/raid does to heal themselves as well. Its always held the gold medal for me as one of the more interesting takes on healing. And unfortunately  I havent really found something similar since.
2065,Its not weird.   &#x200B;  You see  cars are ridiculously complex  and the failure of any given part means that you're going to the mechanic or having to wrench yourself.   &#x200B;  Let's say your car has 100 major components that could go wrong. And at 10 years old  an AC Delco component has a 1% chance of going wrong. Now let's assume on a GM car  all of those parts are AC Delco parts (or you can interpret as: has the same rate of failure as an AC delco part)  &#x200B;  Now if I remember my statistics:  P(at least one part failing) = 1- P(likelihood of a given part failing)\^number of parts  &#x200B;  Aka: very  very good chance that at 10 years at least one of those parts will fail.  &#x200B;  Now  if you have a 10 year old car  and replace an individual part with an AC Delco part  the rest of your car is 10 years old  but that AC delco part is new. AKA  that AC Delco part has a lower chance of failure than the rest of your car!
2066,it's ok and very immersive! I think pandemic and masks plot will stay with us for a long time and is already being introduced in movies and series. if earlier games about the virus were associated with [zombies like this](https://play.stateofsurvival.net)  now the virus has become our everyday reality. so I think your idea is brilliant And I'm looking forward to try your game
2067,It's one of my fave RPG's of all time  I haven't played it since I was in school and i'd like to see if it still holds up. Can anyone recommend a good PS1 emulator? I'm happy to pay a fee if necessary.   Sorry if this post breaks any rules on discussing piracy  by the way.
2068,It's only downhill from where you are  honestly. Manga readers are saying Season 6 is gonna be incredible  but they also said the same thing about season 5  and that was a disaster  so I'm not gonna trust their word.  If you don't like S3  I guarantee you that you won't like season 4 and 5 any more.
2069,Its only reasonable I think  reason why Tesla model 3 and Y sells so well is because they have few competitors from top brands like BMW  MERCS AUDI PORSCHE etc. now Tesla has the upper hand in the sense that them selling a 40k car doesnt hinder their image. People see Tesla as a tech company before a car company  which is why they get a pass on their abysmal build quality. Once that tech is obsolete and competitors catch on  its game over. Compare super cruise to Tesla self driving  and youll see teslas are behind
2070,It's political suicide to run on a platform which includes a speed limit for the autobahn.  I would compare it to the US and their right to bear arms  you just won't get elected no matter which party you run with.  That being said  they are completely different political animals but I like the comparison nonetheless.
2071,Its probably collapsed or your oxy sensor broke (if ur car has one). I would say its probably worth it to just take the thing off. Idk if its really doing anything anymore. OR you could buy a new one if it is actually the cat but thats expensive for an 06 Honda.
2072,It's question with very different answers for every person. Most of the games by design should be possible to beat  They also allow some choices in gear  builds and party composition  which are not always equal. And if limit ability to complete game only for the best ones setup  it means that there's no real choices. So there's normally a window of accepted strategies (and skill levels)  but... if you are making everything perfect  you'll steamroll. If you're making suboptimal decisions  you'll have fun. It you're making to much suboptimal decisions  you'll suffer.  Speaking about the exact games which remain difficult mid to late  from my experience Diablo 2 on the Hell difficulty and Icewind Dale series last chapters were quite brutal for newcomers. Also  if you're looking for challenge  probably such subgenre as an roguelike can be your cup of tea (but it suffers for reversed difficulty curve even more).
2073,It's quite doable but you'll need the following things first  otherwise it will probably be too difficult to keep you in the [zone of proximal development](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zone_of_proximal_development) and thus just a waste of time:  * Reach an intermediate level of C++ programming. A good ballpark heuristic for this is doing at least 1 completely independent project (no tutorials) that's at least 10 000 lines of code. This will likely take you at least 1000 hours  although it may be much longer if you can't take a college course in C++ or have an experienced mentor.  * You'll need to be comfortable with linear algebra. 3D graphics is 100% math.  * You'll need experience with handling raw memory and binary data. This is central to the programming side of graphics.  * At that point  you can jump into learning OpenGL  which is the easiest graphics API. With enough software engineering experience  you should be able to hack together a (crappy) game from first principles just by creating abstractions on top of your graphics code. However  if you want to write a serious game from scratch you'll need to spend several more years worth of programming experience to learn how to properly architect a game engine from the bottom up.
2074,Its really hard to blinding go into for sure. Its veeeery different than web programming. And its hard to know how hard a mechanic will be without doing it for awhile.   My suggestion is to find a game dev course online and take it before trying to make your own creations!
2075,It's really hard to decide what you want to do without taking a few college courses or having a few jobs.  My advice is to take a wide variety of courses in things that interest you for a semester or two of undergrad and THEN declare a major. You can do this at the community college level if you need to keep it budget friendly.  If you REALLY want to do game dev QA  I've heard good things about Texas A&M  Virginia Tech  and University of Michigan. I'm not a professional dev tho  just a hobbyist :).
2076,Its so ironic to see how people in here being hypocrites and say this benchmark is biased just because AoTS developers working with Intel while AMD do the same in very long time ever since RX 480 launched.
2077,It's surprising for me that your mom likes and understands that kind of anime  I have to explain what the fuk is going on in a slice of life to my family  FMA:B should be your next one  it's the kind of anime with elements that you both will enjoy but not too much if your mom is SPECIFICALLY into gore  Demon Slayer is another great choice
2078,It's the 2020 model  it has a RTX 2060 with Ryzen 9 4900h with 16 Gb RAM and 512 Gb M2 SSD. Is there any free antivirus program you recommend or any software and app? Should I set Windows 11 on it and is there any settings I should enable or disable at Windows 10? And anything that you wanna recommend that will make my experience better.
2079,It's the opposite for me  older I get  the less I play RPGs. Mostly because I've been playing RPGs so long  that it's impossible not to compare new ones to the old  and very few modern titles hold up. In the last decade there's been a handfull that actually hold up to the old guard(Atom RPG  Expeditions: Viking and Kingdom Come: Deliverence come to mind  if anyones curious).  &#x200B;  I have however played most of the RPGs released this decade(Disco Elysium  D:OS1+2  Dark Souls  Witcher 3  CP2077  Underrail  and so on)  they aren't able to capture the essence of what makes an RPG (to me)  the way the old games have\\did(and still do).  As such  I find myself playing simulation games more.
2080,It's unfair in its difficulty. The game actively hates you. It will constantly trick you into game overs.  I would actually consider the game the poster-child for unfair.   It would be an easier sell if the encounter rate weren't so high. The item to reduce encounters is expensive. And you can't run.
2081,"It's usually non Anime fans I get questions by   Like ""I hate anime especially Avatar"".  ""Why are underage age girls (naked) in Anime""?.  ""Arnt Anime Satanic  as a Christian you shouldn't watch anime"".  Off the top of my head."
2082,"It's very easy to rip them from the game. It's not a ""legal grey area"". It's illegal.   However  game musicians usually took the samples from publicly available instruments. So if you can track down which synth they used  you can use it too.   For example  MGS1 uses the Roland SR-JV Orchestral mostly. So you can actually use the same sounds as that game legally.   But if you are not sure  don't do it."
2083,it's very flawed  and likely has not aged particularly gracefully (can't be sure  played it on like 2007 or something for the last time) - there's some very shallow characters  some jokes are... problematic  but it's indeed amazing. I played it along Valkyrie Profile Silmeria and Persona 3  all of them were amazing  but SHC is the one I think deserves a remaster the most. it's not happening  but still  one can dream
2084,Its very hard to satisfy everyone. We have to choose the sides  what to consider and what to ignore. Infact  the very concept of games are tackling obstacles and moving forward. I had a small yt channel before and i quit for this same reason but now i regret it. The only cure for such situations are to ignore rather than briefing them. These toxicity are everywhere and its kind of inevitable  open yt and go to comment section to better understand it.
2085,Its worth a try but Id recommend getting it on pc  if you dont mind the lack of portability.  Im also big on jrpgs and tried out baldurs gate 1 for a bit. I got to the titular baldurs gate and just quit playing. The game is definitely interesting but I feel the fantasy setting just didnt really capture me. The combat is also a bit slow in the early game. If youve got nothing else in your backlog at the moment then get the game  it is definitely a slower paced experience that offers a lot of gameplay hours. Id describe it as the kind of game you slowly chip away at each day
2086,It's your rolling radius which will make a difference with the odometer. The rolling radius is the distance from the centre of the rim to the ground.  So tyres & wheels will make a difference but combinations of wheel diameter & tyre profiles can lead you to the same rolling radius.  Your ABS sensor calculates the speed for the odometer by the rpm of the wheels. A larger rolling radius will rotate the wheels at a lower rpm so your odometer will read lower than you're actual speed. Likewise if you have a smaller rolling radius the odometer will read faster than actual speed.
2087,ITT and every LTT thread: people complaining about the title  and pedantic folks nitpicking every little thing.  Yes  the title is clickbait. Yes  so is the thumbnail. Yes  the almighty algorithm dictates the decision. No  it's not misleading  especially if  you know  you watch the content. Yes  content like this is needed for their intended audience (amateur PC enthusiasts.)  Every damn thread the same stuff gets repeated.
2088,I've actually seen a surprisingly high number of Taycans in my general area. And I know I'm not just seeing the same one over and over because they're all different colours  have different wheels  etc.
2089,"I've always been a fan of the ""Blue Mage"" archetype. Having to learn enemy spells and attacks to use them in battle afterwards has always been a fun concept to me  and they often get a lot of different skills and techniques so it's always good to have one."
2090,Ive always been a fan of thieves/rouges due to the flowing capes they tend to have  as well as the greater emphasis and speed/dexterity since I prefer to play characters who dont worry about getting hit as opposed to building tanks that can take hits forever without dying.   More recently Ive become a bigger fan of mages  especially the Final Fantasy Red Mages which are kind of Jack of all trades classes  and they get the fancy hats to boot.
2091,I've always liked the aesthetics of FWD coupes  and there's a charm to them. They're all based on regular economy hatchbacks  yet they look so much more interesting and are sometimes genuinely sportier. It helps that most of them had go-fast versions; Astra VXR  Megane RS  Scirocco R  Pro_C'eed GT.  With the Integra in particular  people wanted it to be a coupe not just for the body-style. Remember that people have also been complaining about how big the Civic and the upcoming Integra have gotten. With various small cars like Honda's own venerable Fit having disappeared from the USA  fans are nostalgic for the days of truly compact Hondas. The coupe reminds them of that. They were hoping that the new Integra would return to Honda's roots (at least to enthusiasts) as a manufacturer of lightweight FWD enthusiast cars that pushed the boundaries of FWD performance.
2092,"Ive beaten all the way up to season of bloom and im partway through the Varnhold Vanishing. I love the combat in this game and the depth of the ruleset.   But frankly  the plot and characters are so weak  and each Chapter's content is so fucking padded. Like holy fuck  this game could do with a major trimming  theres so much like ""content"" that really doesnt add anything to the experience of the game  and frankly  im not sure i want to play like another 40 hours of that.   At the same time though  i would like to like  see the game through and experience its main quest. The main quest is interesting enough  but like  each chapter feels soooooo stretched out for no particular reason. I wouldnt even mind the length if each chapters plotting and questing was actually very deep and interesting.   So overall im just curious  what do yall think? Should i try to see it through or have i gotten the gist of it and wont experience anything fun or new with the rest of the game"
2093,"I've beaten Nocturne when I was maybe 16 or 17 whithout looking for solutions on internet. I liked the dungeons. To find the exit  you don't have to simply ""push the button to open the door"". I found them engaging and original.  I played it on normal difficulty  but the bosses were already harder compared to other JRP typical bosses. Most of the time  it's not about grinding a few more levels to be able to beat the boss  but really about your strategy and the team you use. Some bosses felt more like an enigma to solve than a traditional boss fight. A few were borderline unfair  but most of the time it was alright."
2094,I'VE been  A MECHANIC for FORTY FIVE YEARS!!  Good for you  Scotty. I've been doing math for 45 years and I still suck ass at it.   He's not the WORST mechanic  but he definitely shouldn't be teaching it either.
2095,I've been lucky.  I've had a lot of success.   I have no doubt that if I tried to start today   I would not.    My only advice   to anyone   is to do it for the fun.    If you do it expecting to fail  and that the only benefit to you will be the fun of the process   you will succeed in that  whether or not the rest comes.   Your goal will be to have fun with the process   and that is something you can control.    If you do it with the idea that you'll make money   or that you can do it as a job.   You are going to be in bad shape.   There is just as much luck involved as anything    until you have a loyal customer base  which is much harder to get now  than when I started   ---- Even if you do **everything** right  and your game is fun and bug free   people may not come.   dont do it for money   you can't control that  and it may never come.   Do it cause you enjoy it    if you are tired of working for the day   quit.   If you want to spend too long on some trivial thing that's fun for you   do it.    At the end of every session   you should feel happy that you accomplished something which you enjoyed.   Chances are   your game will not make money.    Games are art  and most artists are never recognized -- even though they may have even more talent than the few fortunate ones who are recognized.
2096,I've been playing Disgaea 4. I'm still on the main story (chapter 6)  rather than in the post game  and my party is far too large to progress at more than a snails pace  but I'm enjoying the game.  It repeats the classic Disgaea formula - mixing ridiculous humour  with a bajillion ways to improve your characters - slowly at first  but eventually transforming them into godlike beings with ridiculous levels of power. This is the series for those who enjoy grinding hard to eventually see huge numbers.
2097,I've been playing masquerade for decades  and while there is the option for sexual content  it can also be totally ignored - nothing in the game requires or relies on it.    Requiem is out there as well  but the content and themes will be much like Masquerade.  (I myself find Requiem to be notably less political than Masquerade  but Requiem fans usually disagree)  While I'm a fan of V5  I don't think anyone is a fan of how that book is laid out  so have some heartfelt agreement on that point.  You mentioned Urban Shadows  and others have mentioned Undying  which are the two main options I know.  There's also a new game coming out  Defiant  which is Urban fantasy with the various supernaturals.  I believe the PDF is on DriveThru.  Buffy had an RPG that allows for vampire characters  but won't give you the political vibe.  Dresden Files RPG ( and Dresden Accelerated variation) also has a few varieties of vampire (three different types  only one if which is the seduction/lust type) that can be PCs  but again  those will lean more to action than politics.  Of course  the table can take any game anywhere.  But really  if I wanted vampire politics  Masquerade is the king and no sex content needed.
2098,I've been playing the old-school Fallout Tactics  which is one of my favorite CRPGs. I autosaved at a super in opportune moment though  and I think I fucked myself right at the end of the game. I've tried to work my way out of it a couple dozen times  I think I'll have to go back 10+ hours of saves. Such is life.  Moral of the story: Create more back up saves more often.
2099,I've been really successful and have had no formal training. Making games in RPG Maker and Klik n Play as a kid was probably more useful than the programming class I did take in college. I mainly learned programming from making Doom wads.
2100,I've been running a Mothership game. My impressions:  - Buttery smooth character creation. - Characters fail practically every check they make. You need to be sharp  as a Warden  to keep things moving past failure. Without a Fail Forward mindset  the whole game grinds to a halt. - Focus on stress over damage. Stress is a really fun mechanic. Damage is boring.
2101,I've been searching for new RPG that has at least some emphasis on loot while maintaining good RPG elements for PS5 and especially 60fps. I mean Bethesda type games in terms of loot  but maybe a bit less repeative(?). DA:O would be quite close of what I mean.  Any suggestions? I know the platform is quite new so those 60fps games aren't that common yet.
2102,I've been stuck playing 3.x / Pathfinder / 5E for actual decades  and I finally just said enough already. So I'm exploring other games and systems  and if people want to try them out with me I'll run stuff. I'm not asking anyone to make a big up-front investment. But some people just want to keep playing what they're used to and nothing else.  edit: not asking
2103,I've been there.  Ended up rereading a book trilogy after finishing it  because I thought it would be great for an RPG.     I dont think it can always be helped  if we we something we enjoy  we want to find a way to share it with others.
2104,Ive been wondering if there are some catchy Anime villain songs (with lyrics) similar to those of western animation  something for the villain to revel in their greatness and taunt the heroes.  I looked it up on YouTube but all I found were rap numbers. Im personally not a fan of the genre and question whether it fits into every anime its featured in.   Many of my favorite villain songs are either Rock (Eggmans theme  Get it (Little Shop of horrors)  Mean Green Mother (same)  Who is the boss? (Felix the cat)).  Or they relate to to the time period and setting theyre in. (Shanty like songs such as the Gaston song or The worst is yet to come.)  Isnt there an anime villain song thats not rap?
2105,I've been working on a tabletop RPG based off of my self-published fiction series titled **Astral Tides** (the golden age of pirates meets space opera) for the last three years  and I finally released the Quick Start Guide to DriveThruRPG! It's Pay What You Want  includes a short adventure  6 pregenerated characters  and the basic rules for gameplay and combat.  I'd love if any of you would be willing to check it out!  [https://www.drivethrurpg.com/product/369524/Astral-Tides-Your-First-Job](https://www.drivethrurpg.com/product/369524/Astral-Tides-Your-First-Job)  **The Setting**  While classic 'tin can' spaceships exist  most interstellar vessels are constructed to be reminiscent of sailing ships of ancient Earth. Decks  masts  and sails are complemented by powerful engines  stabilizing wings  and atmospheric shields. Such ships can sail the seas  fly through the air  or soar through space.  Traveling from one star to another would take months of time unless the ship first enters *Superspace* \- an alternate dimension that exists parallel to 'Normal Space.' Superspace seems to exist in isolated 'streams ' pathways that lead from one general location in the galaxy to another. Ships can travel down these streams as boats could down a river  covering distances that would normally take years in a matter of weeks.  **The System**  Astral Tides uses a d6 dice pool system. Players and the GM roll pools of d6's  choose the highest two out of the roll  and add those two together along with the Attribute being tested (Agility  Might  Spirit  or Wits). If a skill is appropriate for the test  that is added as well. The result is compared to a target number  ranging from 10 to 18  to determine success or failure.  In the case of combat  you deal additional damage based on each point your test exceeded the target's Defense (for physical attacks) or Mental Defense (for mental attacks). When a character accumulates 10 damage  they gain 1 Wound. When a character accumulates 3 Wounds  they are incapacitated. At the end of combat  all damage taken which did not result in a wound is automatically removed. Wounds are a bit more difficult to remove  requiring either rest and downtime  experienced medical care  or magical abilities. Stress works the same way for Mental Damage.  There are 6 species in the game  and the Quick Start guide features 6 of the game's 11 different Aspects (classes). Each Aspect has a unique resource they use to do different things. For instance  the **Protector** begins with a pool of 4 **Vigor**  and may spend 1 Vigor to reduce the amount of incoming damage they sustain  while the **Mercenary** builds their pool of **Grit** over the course of combat  and then spends Grit to make their attacks hit harder. Each Aspect uses their resources in a unique way that reinforces the role the Aspect plays in the game.  The game is built around the idea that every character is part of a crew. When the full game releases  players will create a ship togeth
2106,Ive bought a new VW with a DSG recently  and what Ive noticed is that it almost never uses the 1st gear. Always starts from 2nd.   It does use 1st when e.g. crawling up a hill  but thats basically it.  And when I put it to manual and try to crawl  1st and 2nd are identical. Same rpm  same sound  same everything.  Whats the deal? The engine is 140kw  so my guess is that its just trying to make the ride smoother  but still
2107,I've decided to accept  but not embrace  chips on my cars.  But when I see a survivor at a car show  then I do like seeing them.  There's one particular unrestored 1966 Corvette that comes to mind when you mention this.  It had some very dull spots  rock chips aplenty  and the stories I'm sure it could tell...
2108,"I've done 4 separate full playthroughs of Solasta  I forced myself to finish 1 playthrough of Kingmaker  and I quit Wrath of the Righteous about 2/3 of the way through.  Solasta is the honest CRPG experience. The voice-acting and writing are sometimes questionable  but the gameplay and systems are solid and it makes for a fun  fairly challenging adventure  especially on subsequent playthroughs. It's the truest adaptation of tabletop to video games that you can experience today. It feels like classic D&D but with a fresh coat of paint  and it comes complete with a stale  smoky tavern that serves shitty ale.  Kingmaker and Wrath both use horrifically bloated and overcomplicated systems. Where most CRPGs may allow you to choose a skill  perk  or feat that increases your ability to  let's say  get more successful rolls on spell difficulties of a specific class  Pathfinder likes to break that one skill  perk  or feat into multiple smaller skills  perks  or feats that would combine to give you the same effect. It's got a ton of choice  but heavily leans on the illusion of choice where in order to be effective  you'd have to take a specific combination of things to reach a build goal. Sure  you could get creative and mix some other things in just because they're available and because you *can* do that  but you really want to pick the right things to get the desired effect.  Think of it this way; most CRPGs are like a diner where you can order a hamburger  whereas Pathfinder is a supermarket where you buy the ingredients to make your own. There are a LOT more options for your hamburger in Pathfinder  but ultimately you're going to want to end up with a bun of some kind  beef  and some condiments. Pathfinder (and its fans) thinks it's better just because you *could* choose to put toothpaste on your burger if you wanted to.  Wrath of the Righteous is problematic because of its binary ""good or evil"" forced plot points  where the game **really** wants you to be good and sets everything up for that to make sense from a roleplay perspective  and if you choose evil  the roleplay is completely shattered because you're pigeonholed into being a seething lunatic via reactionary and impulsive choices  and your Lawful Good companions won't bat an eye at your forced murderous tendencies and will even help you kill innocents and only ever comment on your misdeeds if you make a pigeonholed ""me bad guy"" selection at pivotal plot points.  All of that being said  Pathfinder  especially Wrath of the Righteous  has become a bit of a darling around Reddit  whereas I rarely see Solasta mentioned at all  so you're very likely going to get more positive answers toward Pathfinder because it's the newer  more mainstream game that's received more coverage and hype. I've been playing RPGs for about 35 years and have been a D&D nerd for just about as long  so this criticism isn't coming from an ill-informed place. I genuinely do not understand the appeal of Pathfinder at all  especia"
2109,I've done all of the testing I can do and I've replaced everything except the MOB. At this point  it's obviously the MOB.   I initially built this computer circa 2015 (didn't use it until this year) and I know there are better MOB options now. Suggestions? This MOB was expensive at the time and I'd like a cheaper option that's just as good. If that's not possible  fine. I just need a new MOB.  ------  Specs: MOB: Sabertooth 990FX R2.0 (ATX)  CPU: AMD FX-8350 8 Core  RAM: 32GB DDR3 1333MHz PSU: Thermaltake Smart M1200W GPU: FirePro V4900 (AMD)
2110,I've done some searching on the sub yielding relatively little relevant.  I'm gearing up to run a game of Mothership set in the [Axis Mundi](http://goblinpunch.blogspot.com/2013/06/welcome-back-agent.html?m=1) setting in the near future. (For the cliff notes version: PCs are crew members of a colony ship coming out of sleep after 8000 years of things falling apart  torn between rival AIs and other factions.) There's a lot of room to fill in new factions  locations  etc within the ship  and it's large enough to never fully explore in a regular game... but that also implies *travel* inside the ship  which has never been my strong suit to write or run. How can I make travel between different places actually interesting in this kind of environment? Most travel resources are designed for fantasy overland travel or entire spaceships traveling  while I'm basically working with a three-dimensional city here. For now I'm trying to fill the gaps with encounters  but that can only go so far (and can easily get annoying).  Any thoughts?
2111,I've done this so much lmao I've gone from 5e to pathfinder 1e to Savage Worlds to Shadowrun to Mutants and Masterminds to Cyberpunk 2020 to Hero System.. I just like trying out new systems and settings. I was gonna stick with Hero system since it's so homebrew and I could do anything. Was gonna do a superhero campaign since that's my favorite genre but the player who hosts moved and one of our other players didn't want to drive an hour out to play each week (which is understandable). so we didn't have enough players to play.  We found someone else but they refuse to touch anything that isn't 5e but managed to get them to at least try pathfinder 2e. So while I'm not doing my dream superhero setting i can compromise with my current one.  I don't think i've ever had to worry about player investment. I'm a forever GM and my players just love playing in general and if they had a problem they would definitely have a conversation with me about it. Were gonna do a sandbox style game. So i feel like interest can be high because if players aren't feeling a questline or location they can simply move to another area and do something else since there isn't an overarcing mega plot and it's more character focused
2112,I've found out it's way easier to find a system I like and play the kind of games it's made for than taking DnD and homebrew it to run the kind of games I like.  That said  in my case  it's not much of a deliberate and definitive move. I've always been curious to try new games  even while running weekly DnD campaigns. But this year cemented that  as I discovered Vaesen (a game that was basically made for me to enjoy). I have been running two weekly campaigns for over six months  and it has been the smoothest campaign I've ever run (even if it was online).  I'll probably run a few one shots of DnD sometimes  but probably no campaign anytime soon. There are just so many interesting systems to try out to spend much more time on DnD.
2113,I've googled it and still don't understand what Intel Optimized Tensorflow is. Is it a different way to train AI?  edit: Why downvote? I'm asking a good faith question. I've tried to find the answer but failed. I don't see the problem. Please enlighten me.
2114,Ive got a 2013 Altima that Ive had for 6 years with no problems until this summer. One day after a storm I found a bunch of water collected under the front and back drivers side floor. I did some research and was told the likely culprit was a clogged moonroof drain. I checked the front drivers side drain (couldnt find a rear drain) and sure enough there was a bunch of water backed up in the line. I cleared it out and water started draining from the line normally again. A little while later I noticed my floorboards were soaked again  same spot. Checked the drains again and cleaned them out again. It seemed to fix the issue. This week was the fourth time Ive cleaned out the drain and again my front drivers side drain was clogged. This time though on top of my floor being soaked I also noticed water on the column between the windshield and the drivers side door (pic included). https://i.imgur.com/FVAlU6h.jpg  Im taking it in to a mechanic go look at it on Monday but its supposed to rain again tomorrow and Id rather not spend $1k to have him just clear out the drains again. Does anyone have any idea WTH is going on with my car?
2115,I've had 13 cars and I'm only 37 years old  so I no longer become attached to vehicles. They're just machines made of plastic and metal. There are some cars that I regret selling  but even so  they would have been gone eventually.
2116,I've had a computer hiccup and wasn't as backed up as I should and so I've lost a few things.   One was a module (I can't remember the system but that doesn't matter) set in ancient Alexandria where the players were agents of the local governor (or maybe just a local noble).    Can anybody guess what the module name might be?   Thanks
2117,I've had a really good time with it so far. Definitely a little tough around the edges  but the concept is a cool one and it's got a nice atmosphere.  It's heavily focused on investigation and deduction  which I really enjoy.
2118,I've had a similar issue with my e92 3 series. Had a new tyre put on and had issues with shaking of the car when driving. Turned out to be something completely unrelated - rusted calliper needed replacing  might be worth a check
2119,I've had several Dell laptops that I got through work.  They've all been pieces of shit in one way or another.  One of them I'd regularly put to sleep when leaving work and it'd never actually shut off like the article describes (I forget which model it was).  It'd stop all the fans  etc.  but continued to run and create heat.  One day I had gone out to a happy hour after work and when I got home several hours later I almost burned my hands taking the laptop out of the bag because it was so incredibly hot.  I always assumed my IT dept messed up some setting - nice to finally understand what was wrong with it.
2120,I've heard very good things about crossclimate 2's.    There is no such thing as too much grip.  Full stop.    The only thing I can imagine the mechanic means is wheel hop.  That is a thing that can happen with good grippy tires if you put enough power down.  It does not sound like that is what you are describing.  Does it shake all the time?  Possible the wheels were not balanced when they were installed.
2121,I've just realized I have a core  unflinching principle that's existed within me since I've held a controller for the first time: having a main party member taken away in an RPG sucks.  Nothing ruins the enjoyment and flow of the game more to me. I get stressed out and makes me want to quit or rush on ahead as quickly as possible. I don't care if it's for story purposes  or if it's only temporary. I don't like it  especially because they never let you know how long! There's a gaping void in my carefully managed party and it's not interesting for me to fill with a party members I don't like. I think the devs want you to experiment more with less-used party members  but there's gotta be a better way.  So many games that it's absolutely a trope at this point. I've seen it all too when it comes to party members: kidnapped  injured  going on a different journey  or even killed. Yes  I had decided to use a certain character in my main party the first time I played FF7 (okay  it was pretty shocking and impactful tho). Currently I'm playing thru a recently released RPG that I won't name to prevent spoilers  and the character I'm playing is suddenly GONE! That's when I realized I've seen this many times before and I've never liked it.  Are there players who enjoy this? Or maybe you have coping mechanisms? This seems like a really common RPG occurrence across decades but no matter how many times it's repeated  I've never saw it as fun. What's the deal?
2122,Ive learned throughout my rpg journey that some games are worth playing and some arent. Me and brother grew up playing chrono trigger  alundra  arc of the lad  but some rpgs are the same formula and story structure so its the been there done that syndrome. Its not that you dont enjoy rpgs anymore its that you are looking for more complex stories and mechanics and its tough for game developers to hit that itch now a days. Ive been playing tales arise and its a great game  the fighting is fantastic actually  but the story has its troupes as usual. To be fair there are some plot twists that gave me aha moments.
2123,"I've long wondered what the first and second gen Vipers would be like today with modern rubber on them. Would it fix their widowmaker reputation? Even though Baruth writes about ""vintage spec of brake pad and tire"" they have to be much newer compound than the period 90s tires  and he said it was very controllable on track.   As a grain of salt to take with this  Jack Baruth is probably the fastest autojournalist working today  so he doesn't need any traction control."
2124,"I've loved cars for as long as I can remember  honestly - going back to when I would scout out the actual cars over the fictional ones from Hot Wheels and Matchbox. Although me being 21  ""as long as I can remember"" isn't a long time."
2125,Ive met some GMs like that. I think the best solution is to just do one shots of different systems once in awhile whilr running a campaign in the system your players like. Then if one of the one shot games really hits it off with your players you can just keep running that.
2126,I've never been a fan of the Ac series. I recently picked up origins because a friend kept telling me to try it  they rebooted the series  it's different more rpg like.   It was every bit as boring as the earlier titles and I was glad to rush though the main quest and get it over with. The side content and combat are repetitive and extremely easy. I've been told Odyssey is the same except you can't skip the side content  you level very slowly and there is not enough xp from the main quest to ignore it.  I would not recommend them at all.
2127,I've never enjoyed huge text dumps.  It's why I never enjoyed CRPGs back then or now. Since release I've heard that  say  Planescape Torment is the ultimate RPG. But I get nothing out of it.  But there are still plenty of games with a lot less text in them.  And I still love classic DPRGs. Just me  my guys  and a dungeon. That's how I like it. Lore is like  a textbox here and there.
2128,I've never heard of Toby Fox before. From a little bit of googling the subject I've noticed that 1) it seems to be common knowledge that he ripped the soundfonts from Mother. 2) people love the soundtrack to Undertale. 3) A lot of people are under the illusion that if you edit a sample it's perfectly legal.   Kind of sad  imo. Lol
2129,I've never played either of them but what I do know is that the Pathfinder games are based off of Pathfinder and from what everyone says have very complicated rule sets which makes sense if it's based off of Pathfinder which is essentially 3rd edition d&d. So basically if you have played 3rd edition d&d or Pathfinder and have a good understanding of the rules you'll probably love the Pathfinder games if not you might not like them. I say this is someone who's played tons of third edition d&d I love third edition d&d and I would probably love the Pathfinder games but third edition d&d is incredibly complicated and takes a long time to master it's not fun for beginners so I would guess the Pathfinder games may not be fun for anyone who has no familiarity with the third edition d&d (pathfinder) ruleset.
2130,I've not run a scifi game before  and really just need something rules light/med that I can mess around with.  I don't know if what I am going for tonally matters too much  as I'll come up with the setting myself. I just want my players to be able to cook up some weird and wonderful characters  rules for ships would be a bonus  and get stuck in with some npcs that wouldn't be out of place in Hitchikers Guide or Dr. Who.  If anyone has any recs I would love to hear them. I'm open to any kind of system.
2131,"I've noticed a lot of ""Who asked (for your opinion)!?""  ""Stop taking things so seriously  it's just anime"" (often insulting the other person) and ""If you don't like then make something better"" in this sub lately."
2132,Ive owned 2; both Integras. The fact that theyre FWD isnt a selling point; the appeal of the Integra was largely that it handled great at that price. The Integra handled great despite it being FWD but it being FWD likely made it cheaper and have more space in the trunk. The appeal of a coupe is for style and size; I personally prefer the look of a coupe (or 3 door lift back) and dont really care that theres less room for passengers. So basically with the Integra those who want a coupe (me included) want a good handling  styling  affordable  slightly practical car.
2133,I've owned a couple hundred cars. I flipped most of them. There are only a few that I miss. STI  914 racecar  21 window VW Transporter  99 Chevy quad cab Dually  lowered and bagged and lots of HP  70something Volvo 240 wagon for pure reliability. That's about it. Actually owning a car 24 hours a day is kind of absurd if you think about it  when the car just sits unused for more than 20 hours a day for nearly 100% of us.
2134,I've played a lot of rpg games that start difficult and then gradually get to the point that they're fairly easy or sometimes boringly easy mid game to late game.  Sometimes I lose interest if there is no real challenge late.  I think the elder scrolls series is the most obvious example where they start hard but lategame is basically easy mode even on max difficulty.  They're still very good games but I feel like their poor balancing in regard to difficulty leading to a lack of challenge really hampers putting them as high as they otherwise could be on a greatest rpg game list.  That's just my opinion though.  In a lot of rpgs you build up expertise  wealth  and crafting ability and all that  and once you grind them out to where you wanted them you don't actually have to use them anymore to win fights.   Anyway what games stay basically as difficult as they start out?  I might actually prefer a game that gets more difficult forcing you to use all of your learned skills in the game to the max to win a fight.  thanks
2135,Ive played DAO enough to do each origin probably twice lol. And honestly the one that strikes me the most is the human noble and noble dwarf. Mostly because the human noble really gets some pay off later  and kind of as well with the noble dwarf.  So Im terms of which origin is best  thats subjective. But in terms of what have more interesting story implications  Id say those two origins.   Also my biggest advice is dont try to optimize your party at the lost of fun. For example  Wynn is a much better mage to have over Morrigan. But I vastly prefer Morrigan as a character and thusly would rather have her in my party. If youre someone who loves to optimize and thats where the fun is  then go for it. Go into party commands and all that jazz.   Also do EVERYRHING  go everywhere  and talk as much as you can with everyone. I missed out on SO MUCH my first time because I stuck fairly linearly.   Also do everything you can in the village do Lothering before departing lothering. Pick up any quests  do all the chantry board quests. Once you leave Lothering you are never going back there. So dont miss out.   Also be aware doing character side quests fully is really important. For example  one character leads to a fairly difficult boss fight. But if you dont do it  TO COMPLETION youll never know.
2136,I've played so many RPGs over the last four decades that it's hard to pinpoint where to begin. I'm thinking that since a lot of the more common mainstream ones are guaranteed to be mentioned  I'll go off the beaten path and mention a handful of lesser-known (or less popular) ones  including some premium romhacks.  Here's a solid 5 games that I think that everyone **must** play!  &#x200B;  * **MaternalBound Redux**\- This hack is the definitive version of Mother 2 (also known as EarthBound.) This robust romhack is packed with fixes that do everything from restoring cut censored content to adding new sprites and animations. Mother 2 is a heartfelt adventure with a surreal take on contemporary America  and it's packed with a colorful cast of characters and absurd dialog.  * **Final Fantasy VI: Brave New World**\- Another definitive edition of an old classic  BNW is a hack that corrects almost all of the issues of the retail release and brings it in-line with the original vision of the game. Changes include a complete and dramatic overhaul of the Esper system that allows for actual character customization  an increased difficulty as a consequence of correcting broken enemy AI scripts  and countless bugfixes and rebalancing to make the experience more rewarding. This epic tale that touched on mature themes that have stood the test of time is made complete with this mod.  * **Treasure of the Rudras**\- This last hurrah from Squaresoft on the Super Famicom is a wonderful goodbye to the 16-bit era and represents the best of what the technology of the time was capable of. The world has been doomed by the gods  and life on the planet had just 15 days left before it's destruction. It would be up to a handful of heroes to foil the gods plot to save the planet from destruction. It featured stunning graphics  a branching story with multiple character scenarios  and one of the finest custom magic systems ever conceived that's almost unrivaled  even by today's standards.  * **Divine Divinity**\- The first game in the now-loved Divinity series  this robust ARPG proved that you could successfully combine hack-n-slash with a well-written and entertaining story and quest system. It was Diablo for people who wanted more. Although not the first chronological entry in the series  this first game in the series laid groundwork for the world of Rivellon. Some of the NPCs were extremely memorable and have been mentioned or have appeared throughout the rest of the series  and Larian Studios knocked it out of the park with their combination of unique tongue-in-cheek storytelling  dense exploration  and rewarding combat.  * **Tyranny**\- A CRPG in rare form  you play the role of an antagonist  and along with that comes all of the trials and tribulations that you'd expect. You're given enough leeway to wield your authority as you choose. Will you function as the will of your overlord and rule with cold and calculating judgment? Will you carve a path of selfish destruction and 
2137,Ive played through DA:O more times than I care to admit. Im pretty sure Ive done all the origins and classes at this point  except maybe Shapeshifter. Theres really no bad choices  but my absolute favorite was Arcane Warrior/Circle Mage and with Templar/Human Noble as a close second.
2138,I've published three RPGs  plus I've worked as a writer on another 3.  Generally it's fun but it's also pretty labour intensive  expensive  and thankless. A lot of it depends on what you mean by 'make one': are you writing it for just you and your friends? For paid release? Self-publishing?  Play testing a game can take a surprisingly long time as you send it out to groups (and spend time finding those groups in the first place)  iterate over changes  send it out again  etc. You have to grow a thick skin for some feedback.  Artwork  layout and advertising all cost money  and more than you'd probably anticipate.  Despite all that  I still love it. There's nothing quite like finding out someone's played your game and hearing them talk about what they enjoyed about it.  There are two whole subs dedicated to creating RPGs  you might find more in depth answers there: /r/rpgdesign /r/rpgcreation
2139,Ive seen people call it the Dark Souls of RPGs online and I dont think its anywhere near that difficult. The new release does have an easy mode if youre just wanting to experience the vibe and story. But playing it on normal is definitely challenging. Not at all impossible or really even unfair  but like another poster said  its all about buffs  debuffs  and team building.
2140,I've sold cars many times because of financial situations  mostly to buy houses (which appreciate more than cars). My financial situation always gets better long term  and I find another car I like more anyways.   Good time to sell the Miata  and maybe you'll find another car you enjoy more in the future!
2141,I've spent around an hour looking into this  so I feel I have to say something.  Basically  yes  it's illegal. And the owner of some of the sound fonts in question is probably Square / Enix and / or Nintendo. Which surprises me  because TobyFox seems to have stomped all over Square's IP and made millions of dollars doing so. On the other hand  by the time he was done with his Kickstarter he probably had the money to buy a license.  And  interestingly  he did some composition work for Nintendo. My guess is that what happened is a) Nintendo owned the Soundfont licenses  b) he was so successful Nintendo offered to trade some work on their games for not punching him in the face and taking all his money  and c) someone took a big cut of his Undertale money anyways. His 'estimated net worth ' is only around $4M according to people that are looking (which seems very low; Undertale raked in significantly more than that for SOMEONE) so he may have ended up needing to hand off royalties quietly.  If I were to want to use a soundfont LIKE the old SNES one  I'd buy something like this: [https://www.plogue.com/products/chipsynth-sfc.html](https://www.plogue.com/products/chipsynth-sfc.html)  If you bought something like that and used it to make 'original enough' music  you'd almost certainly be fine.
2142,I've transitioned from almost all JRPGs to mostly indie games with some Rpgs intermixed. A lot of indie games respect my limited time as an adult & I can just drop in & play. When I want something longer to sink my teeth into  I go for an RPG and it still usually takes me a couple of weeks to finish it. Don't stress too much  it's a hobby. IF you aren't having fun  there's no problem in branching out.
2143,I've tried it  like  four times now  and I still can't get past the builds and all the choices. Man  there's so much stuff  and I just know I'm messing things up on it. After level 4 or so it all gets a bit confusing for me. Never once got as far as the town building part. Maybe one day I'll figure it out.
2144,I've worked with tires (Les Schwab) for a while. That isn't an issue with the rubber. Most likely a severely unbalanced  or God forbid  bent wheel. Take it back they should rebalance for free if that shop is worth anything.
2145,Jagged Alliance 2  The game is 20 years old and didn't have the best graphics when it came out in 99. There's initially quite the steep learning curve to all the movement.  All that said  it's still the best tactics RPG ever made  especially with mods.
2146,Jahy taking care of a plant? Oh no  they tricked us into watching an horticulture show again!  (As long as they give us more scenes of Jahy&Landlady sleeping together  I'll watch all the horticulture they want!)  Teasing us a new character too? [Potential spoiler about her identity]>!I heard 'Maou-sama'  so she would be the demon lord? For some reason I always assumed the Demon Lord was a guy  but I guess there aren't that many guys on this show hah. Anyway  can't wait to meet her  whoever she is!<
2147,"James' pronunciation of ABT was actually pretty good and accurate. Btw: ABT is probably the biggest rip-off tuning company here in Germany.  The BMW performed as expected. In the end it has noticeably more hp than stated. In combination with xDrive the winner was clear from the beginning.  Too bad it's an unbelievably ugly and quite heavy thing. The new fancy bucket seats are very good to impress journalists and people in the showroom-unfortunatly they are the most uncomfortable seats on sale right now.  The manual is a mediocre execution and could also be used in a 118i.  And they could add some feel back especially in terms of steering but thats not why people buy these cars. While the G8x is better than the predecessor it's still nothing more than ""a bit better than your average EPS steering"" experience."
2148,Job means nothing unless the game defines it.  The only game with Jobs is FFV.  Job is like Class  except **you can change it any time  whereas Classes are traditionally permanent** and fundamental for each character.  Its like asking how a Combo is different from a normal move.  It varies by game  games have different mechanics and systems.
2149,Journalists have got to quit doing stuff like this - it's exactly how Outer Worlds got overhyped and ultimately sandbagged because it wasn't FNV.   Avowed needs to be its own game  knock it off. And for eff's sake do better with writing  they sound like idiots in this thing.
2150,Just a head's up  shareholders with voting privileges can trigger a board election. Some companies have different tiers of stocks  some have only one. You can buy voting stock for activision-blizzard.   Why is this important? If enough voting shares (not people  *just* shares) call for the board to be fired  then there is a legal mechanism that will auto-fire the board and initiate a board election in which the voting share holders can propose new board members.  It doesn't take millions of people to do it  it just takes enough shares to pass the threshold as prescribed in the company's bylaws (which they're legally obligated to follow). So this guy doing this is trying to get the ball rolling. I bought a share of blizz and if I did this right then I can also call for changes and I would call for the board to resign to make way for better management.
2151,Just always have. Grew up with a perpetual MGB project car on blocks in the garage  went to legend car races  etc. Big periods of honing in on what I specifically loved about cars as a teen and got more focused going into my early 20s when I started autocrossing. Back in the mid-late '00s in college I'd torrent Top Gear as it aired and have car friends over to watch since streaming wasn't a thing and none of us could afford the weird satellite packages that could possibly let us watch it properly.
2152,"Just an FYI: this is Cory Doctorow  a well known and popular blogger from before the age of Reddit. Youngsters who don't know him should give him the respect he deserves (He's one of the early pushers of ""Creative Commons"")!"
2153,Just because they have forgotten that you are a worker who is producing a commercial product doesn't mean you should. You're a worker  not a therapist.  Your job is to make a great game and sell it to people who want entertainment. Not... all that other stuff you're talking about.
2154,Just confirmed  the Levorg wagon with the badge it should.of came with in 2016  Seriously thought  Levorg is a great car  just the name screwed up the sales it should of had. Will be CVT only again  seriously considered buying one but wanted a manual.  The 1.6T Levorg was pointless
2155,Just finished **Neverwinter Nights 2s** Official Campaign (after a year break) and transferred my character to the expansion  **Mask of the Betrayer**. The increase in quality is noticeable right from the start. Especially in the writing. Great atmosphere too.
2156,Just finished Tales of Arise  that was pretty fun. You might like it since I've played and enjoyed every game you have.   Star Wars Fallen Order  Mad Max DBZ Kakarot (if you like DBZ  otherwise just an okay action game with some light rpg mechanics) Kena: Bridge of Spirits A Plague Tale
2157,Just from a cursory glance  I see a few issues. On the whole  there's just a whole lot of fluff here. Cut that out and you might have something at some point down the line  but you need to have something to show off before you start trying to show something.  First of all  it took around 40 seconds before you even got to anything of substance. You've got a long intro  you've got a shot of coffee  it's all fluff  filler. It doesn't help that the audio balancing makes you very difficult to understand  you're a lot quieter than the music you used in your intro. Jumping through the video  there's a timelapse of you drawing your logo. That could be interesting. By the end  I'm looking at you rendering that logo on your game screen. That's it. You drew a logo  you drew it to the screen. I'm not sure what kind of game this is  nor why I'd want to continue watching. Not entirely sure who this is for either. If it's for people interested in the game  then there's not a lot of stuff to see here yet  so you're better off showing that when you've made some substantial progress. If it's to talk about the game development process from start to finish  then it's a weird place to start by doing the logo  something I'm not even thinking about until way late into the game development process. Usually I'm making prototypes and stuff to start.  If you're looking for some kind of following for your game  you have to know who your videos are for  and get their attention right out of the gate. Want a following for the particular game? Talk about that.
2158,Just got back from the hardware store in my '63 356. I drive it as often as I can because A) I love it and B) it's bad for cars to sit unused. As for mods  no I do not mod my car other than things that are necessary to keep the car safe/driving well and are reversible. Example I added a bolt on disc brake kit for better braking but it can be reversed to drums easily.
2159,Just imagine closing your eyes and you wake up with no limbs or senses. You can never taste a good wood fired pizza again...  But you can probably find some incredible niche subreddits fast so there's that.
2160,Just like how resolution becomes less important the further away you are from the screen  similar is with framerate. Since you have to sit at least 2-3 meters away from this thing I wonder how perceivable is the difference between 120 FPS and 240 FPS at that distance.
2161,Just looking at my own shelves:  - Fiasco - Dream Askew - Witch:The Road to Lindisfarne  - Undying - Golden Sky Stories - Do: Pilgrims of the Flying Temple - Two Summers - Blood Feud - Red Carnations on a Black Grave - Ribbon Drive - The Skeletons - Parsley Games - Sweet Agatha - The Clay That Woke - Solipsist - For the Queen - Something Is Wrong Here - Night Forest - Nobilis  - Amber  - Alice is Missing   In addition to those  I have a [mailing list](https://timeoftribes.com) where I irregularly post diceless games of my own creation.
2162,Just speaking from my Swiss perspective  when the Taycan was announced I was sure it would only be a matter of little time until it outsells the Model S. The Swiss just love their Porsches. Sure enough  it didnt take long until I saw more Taycans on the road compared to Teslas.
2163,Just started Dragon Quest XI yesterday on the PC (Steam) after finishing Solasta.  Played for about 6 hours.  I haven't played a DQ title since like the late 80's  early 90s (1 and 2).  I forgot how fun it was.  So far great story.  Combat is what it is  but I don't play games for the combat  I play for the story and character development / interactions of which DQ11 is really rich with thus far.  We'll see if it holds up.       Happy gaming everyone.  Hope your journey is swift and plentiful and may you slay whatever dragon / evil mastermind / alien / orc / etc  etc. with malice and efficiency.  Don't forget to bring healing potions (or whatever the equivalent to that is for what you are playing)!
2164,Just try a new power cord first.  Plugs can get worn out from the constant pushing in and out.  Particularly round plugs like power cords and headphones.  Micro USB ports also. Not sure about USB type C though.
2165,Just want to point out that all of the modern i5s are transverse mounted. Can be put into most things due to compact size but it won't be very easy or cheap. I want to put an RS3 engine in my A5 eventually and have been trying to find someone do it first.
2166,Just want to say I'm really impressed by the quality of production. It feels like an animated movie  similar to Mushoku Tensei's quality. I was afraid this show would turn out to be generic art and slow direction  but it's done really well.  The characters are colourfully written and portrayed  with actual character motives  putting this far above your typical cookie-cutter isekai trash.
2167,Just watched the 2 episodes that are on CR and man I'm in love with this show already. Already threw the light novel up on my wishlist so when it comes out I'm buying it. Can't wait to see more of this show
2168,Just what we need  the an unelected stable of bureaucrats telling us what format of connector cable we should use. How will they handle upgrades  by government committee? Sounds terrible.   But I'll answer my own question - they won't. They'll let users in other nations get those upgrades rolled out to them first  then make a new mandate to use that connector.   USB-C Is great until it isn't. It get clogged with dirt and detritus then stops working. It also breaks at the metal tip.  Wireless charging is a thing and will soon be superior in every way. Then Europeans will have to wait years for the slow and plodding unelected officials to dither over a new law.
2169,Just yesterday my computer stopped showing wifi networks that were available to me just a few hours before. I checked my devices and the wifi adapter is not working.   I have tried reinstalling it  updating it  and restarting the computer. Any other things that I could do?
2170,Keep at it dude! Game development can be a big pain in the ass and finishing a game is one of the hardest tasks to do  but it can be very rewarding. Experience as web developer might actually help you in designing user interfaces and stuff!   Just make sure you still have fun doing it!
2171,Keep in mind:  Android 11 released September 8  2020.  Microsoft Duo released September 10  2020.  The Duo still doesn't have Android 11.  $1500 for a device with a company who refuses to update their devices  hard pass.
2172,Keep them sealed  and show them in 60 years to your grandchildren  talk them about one Era that Humankind had still to use Operating Systems Manually Installed in Computers.

2173,Ken Block when he drives his Hoonicorn: \*Tire murdering\*Ken Block when he drives this: \*Rear tires proceed to slowly die\*Ken Block when he drives anything that's fast and able to slide: \*INITIAL D EUROBEAT INTENSIFIES\*Like he said back when he drove the quattro group B car  \*pretty much from what I remember\* He doesn't take it easy on cars  which might be the reason Ford wouldn't have let him have a new GT.    Or any other brand that knows what this man does to cars.
2174,Kids and horror don't usually mix very well.  In a horror game in my view  for the feeling to work you need the possibility that all will die  and the ability to describe horrible pain and wounds when necessary.  A good replacement for horror with kids is simple mysteries  you could use /u/JavierLoustanau 's recommendation of Kids on Bikes  but in my experience that game was so slow and boring that even I as an adult could not enjoy it.  I'd recommend instead to use a very simple system  each kid character has a few skills  just roll a d20 with the good skills +3 or something  and use a module such as [The Dare](https://www.drivethrurpg.com/product/220315/The-Dare)  a C.O.C. module about kids in a haunted house
2175,Kinda bummed its not the circuit pack (performance) model with Torsen diffs and lighweight rims. Still very excited seeing Doug liking my (future) car!  Also the infotainment and backup camera are really not representative of whats being sold on other markets damn Toyota Mexico.
2176,"Kinda have to narrow it down a bit  OP. Otherwise  just google ""best RPGs"" and you can find a couple hundred lists. I'm struggling to list out some recommendations because there are just way too many great games out there.  If you want a must play RPG for the PC  I think Disco Elysium is a no-brainer. Might just be my favorite game  period. Somehow managed to surpass the hype."
2177,"Kinda sounds like you really just don't like rpg's. If even Divinity OS2's over-descriptions and quest markers are ""vague town and quest stuff you _still_ need other people to point you to""  no retro game is going to be straight-forward and ""clean"" enough to be enjoyable."
2178,Kinda.  I totaled my 2013 tundra in 2019 and didn't have gap insurance  even though I thought I did.  Anyways  I needed an affordable car and I drive Toyota SUVs and pickups.  I purchased a 2000 Toyota 4runner SR5 4x4 with options and it had 170k for 6000.  Also it is mint as can be.  Covid............  The market is nuts and people are selling the same car for like 12-15k.  Are people buying?  I have no idea lol.  I will probably keep it forever though because I'm weird about Toyotas
2179,Kingdom come deliverance is really good but I see alot of hate on it because in the beginning you will get your ass kicked and that's how it's ment to be. Your a nobody with no skills and until you put in the time and effort to get better you will suck. Also having better gear helps but it takes some work to get it.
2180,Kingdom Come: Deliverance - get it with all DLC  it's excellent. One of the best RPGs in the last 10 years  up there in my all time top 10 if not top 5.   It would also help to list most of what you've played  so people don't waste time writing a detailed post for anything you may have done already. I don't know if you've played only big ones from the last 7-8 years or slightly older ones like Dragon Age: Origins or Fallout New Vegas too.
2181,Kingdom Hearts  Atelier Ryza  Ni No Kuni  Digimon Cyber Sleuth  Dragon Quest Builders  Yonder  Kitaria Fables  Stardew Valley  Celeste  Hollow Knight  and Cat Quest.  There is still action in some of these  but nothing bloody  gory  or overly violent. It should be palatable and easy enough for kids to handle.
2182,Kingdom Hearts 1.5 and 2.5 Remix are great to play with the kids as it involves a lot of familiar Disney Characters. KH III is by far superior but I recommend playing the first two to get into the story and lore.
2183,Kingdom of Amalur? But that one gets thrown around quite a bit.   Titanquest is mentioned often.  Maybe Mount And Blade Warband or Bannerlord? Although they're more of a sandbox type RPG with a focus on Small Unit Tactics  you can become a killing machine after some levels. In Big fights I can kill up to even 100 enemies personally! You've got almost any medieval weapon you can think of.
2184,Knight/Warrior with a sword  shield  and heavy armor.  Knights are my favorite warriors from history. And European styled  double edged  swords are my favorit weapons (I tend to prefer the one handed ones as well). And of course European styled full plate armor is my favorit armor. The shield also feels right and fitting to me when it comes to this as well.
2185,Kobayashi-san OP and ED. Truly remarkable.   Even though it ended up being a mediocre at best anime  Higehiros OP and ED were stellar  I especially liked the ED.  Combatants will be dispatched had good OP and ED  Tomozaki-kun had a good OP by same artist as Higehiro
2186,Konosuba- comedic take on Isekai genre. Imagine always sunny in Philadelphia but in anime with less really awful stuff  Kaguya sama love is war- comedy romance and my favorite rom com I've ever watched  Miss Kobayashi's Dragon Maid- slice of life comedy with dragons. Also one of my favorite second seasons of an anime ever
2187,KOTOR everything except the graphics holds up really well and is better than most games today. Alsobit annots me that they are rewriting the story as the story of the original is one of the best things about it.
2188,Lady Blackbird is dead simple and good for a 2-4 session game.  You can also run other one shots or simple systems if the normal GM needs more time including:  Fiasco  Roll for Shoes  Lasers and Feelings   Knave  Everyone is John
2189,Landlady first character in the ED? I'm now expecting a full arc about her!  Anyway  that was cute! Jahy looked adorable  hopping forward after rolling the dice.  Seems like we're gonna meet a new character  can't wait to see what her relationship will be like with Jahy (and whether Jahy will need to hide her weakness from her)!
2190,Landsknecht from Etrian Odyssey.  Nothing like leading your party in a 30-hit combo on the boss  where each hit does more damage than the last.    I also like regular old fighters  though.  I like not having to worry about whether I can equip something  not worrying about which spells to use  and not worrying about if I can survive.  I just want to hit stuff until it falls over.
2191,Large spiders have been a constant in RPGs since RPGs have existed. All RPGs and their subgenres are derivative of Dungeons & Dragons  and D&D loves its large spiders. So yes  I believe that unless someone has only played a tiny handful of RPGs that they've noticed it. It's a staple of the genre.
2192,Last epoc is new and pretty easy once you understand it  maybe on older title like Victor Vran which has a good story and pretty simple  or Torchlight 2. Have you considered a rogue like with rpg elements  Hades  Arboria could be your thing.
2193,Last RPG I enjoyed was the witcher 3 choice has zero impact on gameplay in RPG's now.   And the plots are the same thing over and over again. It's like watching a remake of the same movie over and over again.  If my choice has no impact might as well watch a movie 
2194,Latest generation of TVs for gaming on PS5 and whatever the latest Xbox is called again  are pretty good. And these TVs appear to have much better QC than monitors. Just wall-mount these suckers and they give more bang for the buck than high-tier gaming monitors.
2195,Laughed. My first two cars were pieces of shit. I was glad to see them disappear.   My third vehicle I missed. Best thing to do is take the money  run and not think about it further.  Maybe this will sound very un-auto enthusiastic of me  but its a car. Theyre replaceable. Someday you will get something cooler and better. Its fun to look back on the past and miss a vehicle and the times it brought you  but life never stops and new doors open.
2196,"Laurien's Garden: for a Mage the Ascension game  I've created a kind of ""demi-plane""  where you can enter through a couple of ways. Insidenit  Laurien  a Verbena Arch-Mage  waitsnfkr you in her Garden. There are trees  plants  birds  animals  and  in the middle  a clearing  200m wide  covered by the branches of a huge  undescript tree  which top covers the whole clearing in a soft shadow.  Nos  here's the thing  only Laurien lives here. And  I mean  only her. From the smallest blade of grass  to the mightiest Roc soaring the skies  even the towering tree in the clearing  it's all made of *her*  so she can sense anything and everything within it  and she can *be* wherever she needs to."
2197,Layer  isolate  and shallow breadth.  A layer is a complete set of things you don't actually require (town B). Do you need to be driving a tank ... probably not.  Isolate is difficult to explain  it's about set pieces. Identify the items that are 90% of everything then identify the 90% of the remaining 10% that you don't actually need. The oatmeal can model will work for the tang can model ... just make a new texture.  Shallow breadth is something you've seen in hundreds of games. Damage and status systems in an RPG ... shallow breadth. You have a lot  but it's all mostly moot beyond style and the player's mental narrative.
2198,LED being diodes currents goes up exponentially with voltage  so it gets a bit more tricky to control LED brightness with DC (need closed loop control). On the other hand you can control brightness very easily with PWM (open loop).  Most of the designers do not see PWM as an issue.  More tricky = slight increase in complexity and cost more.
2199,Left the state that my new d&d group played in. Came back but didn't start gaming. Got back into that hobby by learning about different games and pitched the new game to my old d&d group. I've been gm ever since I convinced the former DM that he could play for a change
2200,Legend of Dragoon is a grossly overlooked RPG that is really good.  Combat is turn based but still managed to feel ineractive because of how they do combos.  The plot is great.  It's got PS1 graphics  but you seem to be down for that.  Seriously  you (and everyone else that hasn't played it) should go give it a shot.
2201,"Legend Of Zelda: Breath of the Wild. You can use abilities and game physics to ""cheat"" at puzzles and majority of quests are optional to actually win the game. The game gives you simple rules and tools and lets you use them... Without the artificial limits of most games. Granted  much of the time the ""intended"" solution will still be the easiest way but the world is very responsive and dynamic and full of surprises."
2202,"Let me guess: people being pissed this monitor was not made for them  that is: for gaming  with 144Hz support and for just 600$.  And rationalizing that's not a problem because you can get a 48"" OLED TV for much cheaper (than this monitor)  because everybody wants a gigantic TV on his desk as a monitor  right ? That's so predictable. OLED monitors for gamers in reasonable sizes will surely arrive one day  but it's not now."
2203,Let's be real - there are no unique ideas in the world.  Especially those based on various popular anime IPs.  As for how to swing Berserk as a TTRPG  my first suggestion would lie within the OSR domains.  You want lethal and brutal combat  which OSR is pretty good at.  Shadow of the Demon Lord sounds perfect for this.  Or maybe one of the Warhammer RPGs might do the trick.  While less fitting  there's also BESM and OVA  the anime-inspired systems.  Not so hot for emulating the grim nature of Berserk  but it'll suffice in a pinch.
2204,"Lets imagine you have a dumb idea  but you execute it perfectly. The gameplay is smooth  the art is gorgeous  the story is written to perfection  the soundtrack is excellent in and of itself  the community is cultivated and you've even got multi-media aspects - cinematic ads that use a gorgeous art style and bring the game alive even more than it is in-game . . . Does anyone care it's a dumb idea still? Of course not. They may even adore the fact that you made such a good game with such a dumb concept.  Then  you have a great idea - but you execute it poorly. Terribly. It looks bad. Already  alright  it's over more or less for a huge portion of players. But lets imagine it also has bad music  bad gameplay  the controls are terrible  there's gamebreaking bugs  there's poor optimization so even strong GPUs can't run it well  you fail to live up to the idea's potential . . . People  perhaps even more  are frustrated. ""I really wanted to like it  but . . .""  And a lot of games with cool concepts do keep everything super simple  they try to have a good aesthetic if they can't wow people with high definition . . . But the decision to keep things simple  the aesthetic of simplicity  the design of keeping things tight . . . All of that is *execution.* I can say ""A super simple platformer that plays with the idea of gravity"" but actually *doing it*  keeping it simple and small in scope while still playing with the concept well and such  that's not as easy as just saying it.  I also can imagine a game better than the best game ever *right now* without any real effort. ""It's like [best game ever]  but better in [whatever ways]!"" Is that valuable concept though? No  because anyone can think of it.  Broad ideas are like air. They're there. Free. Obvious. You need ideas and air - but you don't need to pay for them  they don't have value until value is *added* to them. Maybe you compress that air  or maybe you use that idea as the starting point of a good game . . . But  alone  the idea and the air are generally worth nothing  despite being so useful.  You want to use a good idea to start  sure  but things like  *""Can I execute this idea well?""* Are far more important  because if people can't adequately engage with it and you can't adequately expand on the idea . . . Well  the best idea in the world isn't good for you if you can't actually do it."
2205,Level1Tech also just released a video [bitching about cables](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yt7NTP4AD9Y).  I kind of miss the old days when you could run USB over a rusty coat-hanger without an issue. Don't miss the transfer speeds though.
2206,Licensed RPGs have the advantages of branding and prior knowledge. I recently ran the Alien RPG. The people I offered to run it for were excited because they like Alien and I didnt have to explain the general aesthetic because theyve seen the movies.   Downsides are many. Theres the player who pedantically corrects the GM  the GM who rigidly follows the lore to the detriment of the game  the worlds that are literally designed around a single story  and probably a lot of others Im not thinking of.  For me  the big issue is the fact that licensed games have a literal expiration date in their license. For comparison  try getting a copy of the licensed RPGs Margaret Weiss Productions put out in the Cortex line. Nowadays you can get the Cortex Prime Handbook  but for a long time the Cortex system only existed as licensed games that were impossible to find because MWP lost the license to Smallville  Marvel  and Firefly. Same applies to the other licensed RPGs. Kind of sad to see potentially interesting designs locked behind IP nonsense.  Oh  and its not even slightly a recent trend. Theres been a steady stream of licensed RPGs since ever.
2207,lightning cable is more than enough. i dont see the obsession on usb type c. thats not the best standard at all. first of all  it is thicker than lightning  it makes ur phone thicker and heavier. second of all  port is not female and the plug is not male. its unknown. theres a plastic piece on the middle which is easily breakable  so its not durable. i can charge my iphone 5 without any problem but i have loose contact on some of the type c devices i own. so i prefer lightning port over usb c  i dont see apple going for type c on iphones anyways.  if u need any standard  then choose lightning to be universal lol.
2208,Like 7 years ago we were going through a really rough pregnancy and my wife was going on short-term disability then leave for at least 6 months. We downsized by going from 2 cars to 1 when I sold my unicorn truck (F350 Crew Diesel 6Spd) sucked at the time because it had been a few years to find it  but had to happen.  A few years later got the bug again  2 years of searching after that I found an almost precise copy and have it back although as a third very occasional use rather than my primary vehicle.   Almost anything can be replaced as circumstances change and Ive found the hunt/anticipation is half the fun.  I am actually picking up a new ride tomorrow after my Ford sales guy called me and someone backed out of a pre-order. The car is great but I was missing the anticipation of a new car because I hadnt expected anything to come and then it did.
2209,"Like the title says. I'm very curious to hear from people who were **really** nervous about GMing  maybe thought they would never try it  but ultimately changed their mind. What changed your minds? What pushed you from  ""No  GMing isn't for me"" to ""Ok fuck it  I'm doing this"" ?  I'll go first. I was positive I would never GM because my first campaign was DnD 5e and I have a hard time remembering all the rules of 5e  I dislike how DnD combat works  and also because I have next to no fantasy worldbuilding skills. Then I went through a miserable experience trying to co-DM a campaign. Most of the issues stemmed from me and the other DM being incompatible as co-DMs  but for a long time I was certain that this experience proved I had zero GMing skills  and I swore I'd never GM or co-GM any RPG ever again. But after venting about the co-DMing experience to a friend of mine  my friend told me that he and another mutual friend of ours would be happy to play any rpg that I wanted to GM and that they would be extremely forgiving of any mistakes or floundering on my part. And just hearing someone say out loud that they'd be supportive of me no matter how much I stumbled  and believing them  convinced me to rethink my vow. And now I've GM'ed two games of Ten Candles this month (for two different friend groups) and I'm gonna GM one more next weekend (a third group). :) I definitely still have a lot to work on  but I know now that I want to keep practicing GMing rules-light one-shots.  So  previously terrified and/or self-doubting GMs  what was your tipping point?"
2210,Like when I recently replaced a high pressure hose that holds clutch fluid  mechanic said the difference in clutch pressurize is normal. After I properly bled it myself  guess what felt normal again? To his credit he did hit me up the next day to fix it but I already did by that time.
2211,Like you  I came to gamedev from web development and decided to start with Godot Engine  which turned out to be very handy for me with its concepts  Python-like and syntax.  So after almost year of development I have good working demo and plan to release my game next year.
2212,Like... Everything. But it's my own fault.  My B16B was never in the US so I have to use B18C5 part numbers and they still don't always work even though everything is the same besides internals. I went through 3 distributor caps to find the right one. The plug wires also don't fit over the valve cover slots and I'm not sure why because they're OEM and I've tried multiple years of OEM  The mustang has spindles from a different year and a big brake kit that isn't made anymore and I always forget what parts it used.  Modifying your car is fun until you have to fix something lol
2213,Likely because the strategy and management segment is still making games like they were in 1992  but with shinier graphics. Stellaris was an obstinate bore  barely worth playing  not worth sticking with. Throw out the 4X template  slash the marketing budget  and actually fund innovative development.
2214,Lincoln LS is a pretty handsome sedan with nice proportions. They've depreciated pretty hard over time. The V6 is the one to go for if reliability is a concern  it features the bulletproof Mazda/Ford Duratec V6.
2215,Lion & Dragon you could do the war of the roses  &#x200B;  Mazes & Minotaurs has the Classic Greek Feel [http://mazesandminotaurs.free.fr/](http://mazesandminotaurs.free.fr/)  &#x200B;  Gurps has Ancient Greece   &#x200B;  Heroes of Hellas is another Ancient Greek type Game   Dragons of Britan or Age of Arthur   Harn  Pendragon  or Ars Magica would almost work  High Medieval would almost work   Oh I know and it covers history  Recon and 1980's Israeli Merc Supplements & Adventures   Go for a ride in a helicopter what could happen?  &#x200B;  Miniatures opens up a whole lot of options  Nuts from 2hr Wargames   Chipco Knights or Chipco TCE could be played on a lunch break   &#x200B;  A zillion flavors of Napoleonic Rules
2216,"Listen to the audiobook ""Blood  Sweat  and Pixels"" when you get a chance. Super motivating  but also super sobering as well. I mean ya gotta consider. If hundreds of people and tens of millions of dollars still sometimes can't get a game to market  well  that sure does tell ya something!     There was a quote in there (that I'm totally gonna butcher) that says something like ""It's a miracle any game ever gets made at all!"""
2217,Literally everything for the 740ld in my sig. There are few enough of them in the states (definitely less than 500  may be even fewer than that) that I'll usually just specify it as a 5-series diesel when getting parts. Even a lot of the Euro-centric parts shops won't put it in their app catalog.   For the 4Runner  the O2 / fuel mix sensors. Toyota put in two different kinds of sensors (one a traditional O2 sensor for 49-state cars  the other a FA ratio sensor for California cars)  with two different length pigtails depending on whether it was a manual or an auto transmission. Both Amazon and Autozone had that one wrong. Fortunately that car isn't terribly annoying to work on  and I can usually just get a picture off the actual part before I try to source a replacement.
2218,"Lol I did the same thing. I thought  ""I'm in IT  I know python and enough other languages to move around well enough. This should be easy!"" Ha! Poor sweet naive me.    What always surprised me was how much I had to learn. Like every time I turned around I had to learn more stuff. Ok  now I need to learn 3d modeling. Ok  now I need to learn sound design. Ok  now I need to learn 3d sculpting. Ok  now I need to learn terrain building. Ok  now I need to learn animation. Ok  now I need to learn UI/UX design. Ok  now I need to learn video editing. Oh and now I need to learn freaking marketing so people will actually play my game!   I see these posts now where people say ""I really want to get into game development but I don't know how to program!"" And I think ""oh  you poor sweet innocent soul. There are dozens of things you don't know how to do."""
2219,lol Imagine loosing your whole expensive gaming PC or worse  your house over a simple fan hub. Fan hubs can be bought for like 10 bucks. So if they're retailing for that low imagine what it costs to make.
2220,"lol.  What a dipshit.  The dude fucked up the install and is trying to play it off to get rid of your friend because shes a she and doesnt know anything about cars.  Good news is that a tire is likely out of balance.  That is a SUPER easy fix.  Something like $15 / tire.  Heres what you do:  Take it to a different tire shop to have it fixed.  There is no point in having an incompetent and dishonest person to fix their mistakes. Ask the new shop to document what they find and give you a quick write up.  Something quick like ""Found tire out of balance"" is fine.   Then call the original shop  tell them you want the balancing services refunded (you'll still pay for the tires).  If they give you grief  just tell them you are going to issue a chargeback if they dont do the right thing.  If they still refuse  hang up.  Then go on your credit card website and issue a partial chargeback by going through the dispute process."
2221,lolicons rejoice! onee sans are cows. jks are good but not the best. lolis are the cutest things in the world and will snuggle up to you with multiple of their friends. five lolis in one hug  happiness!
2222,long story short  you get much better performance from an rpi 4.  Phoronix is optimistic that this difference can be made up in architecture optimizations  but I'm not quite so optimistic.  *edit*: spelling
2223,Look at any real life religion. They'll claim stuff like being about love and forgiveness or being a religion of peace  but the deeper you go the worst they turn you into. Do lots of shady manipulative shit or outwardly violent crap under the guise of good intentions. Like  run orphanages  but create the orphan problem with purity culture bullshit and sell the kids wherever or use them as cheap labor...
2224,Look for capacitors on the motherboard. They look like little cans with silver tops.  Run your finger gently on them. Every one of them should be perfectly flat. Like   no bend at all. If any of them are bowed out or have brown schmutz on them  you have bad caps on the board.   Look up capacitor plague online for example pictures of what to look out for.  I'm suggesting this after reading your responses in the thread.  Computers are very deliberate.  The generally accepted practices that have developed over the years go to great lengths to tell the user what is going on with the machine. If it's not posting at all and operating erratically in the hardware that usually points to something much more fundamental going on with the semiconductor components on the board.   Cap plague will produce your symptoms.
2225,Look into DirectX11 and Win32 APIS. DirectX11 is a 3D graphics API that lets you interact with the GPU. Win32 is the Windows API that lets you open a window and do important OS-specific tasks like opening file handles and getting timers. You can use OpenGL and the X11 API to do the same on Linux
2226,Look into Enderal. It's a complete conversion mod that overhauls Skyrim and let's you explore an entirely new world with its own lore. It's free  you just need to own Skyrim. There are two versions. One uses standard vanilla Skyrim  and the newest one uses the Special Edition I believe.
2227,Look into statute of limitations maybe? If it's like 180 days or something just wait that long to do it. But for now I wouldn't touch it because I'm not gonna get busted for something so simple as a $500 work laptop
2228,Look up Artifexian on YouTube. He has videos covering everything from plate tectonics onwards and has a process which can produce atlas quality maps - I've not used this myself as I still use pen&paper.  Be careful though. I did the whole cosmology to tectonics to climate to biomes and then decided that my world would have a very different basis and so that work was wasted. If you are building a flat world that travels the cosmos on the back of a giant terrapin this real world science ain't gonna help.
2229,Looking back to elder scrolls 2: Daggerfall may give you some interesting ideas!  In character creation you can make yourself immune/resistant/susceptible to certain elements  allergic to certain materials in exchange for how quickly you level  could be a fun aspect to one of your NPCs-
2230,"Looking for a solid gaming laptop that can also double as a perfect Remote Desktop work computer.  Mostly play League  WoW  nothing TOOOO graphic intense.  Like a bigger screen  too.

2231,Looking for some games on mobile to play but Google Play store filtering is atrocious and only recommends games with in-app purchases  mainly.     I don't mind games that aren't pay to win and I don't mind paying for a game  just don't want to deal with the typical toxic microtransaction strategy of making them basically essential to play the game.     Prefer non JRPGs and single player. Not a fan of MMOs. Thanks!
2232,Looking mainly for open world RPGs  but open to other RPGs  As I get older  I have less patience for bugs. I was playing Kingdom of Amalur: Re-Reckoning for a few hours  and I already got a bug where I can't finish a quest. A side quest so it doesn't really matter  but it happening so early ruins the experience.  Bethesda games are fun  but the bugs and crashes on PS4 are grating. I have a better appreciation for AC Odyssey because I haven't had a single bug or crash on that.  What RPGs on PS4 have minimal bugs? I just want games that can do the bare minimum without breaking. I have played AC Odyssey and Dragon Crown Pro recently and had no bugs at all.
2233,Looks awesome  I'll give it a try asap. I actually stumbled across your game earlier this year and I was under the impression that it had been abandoned and stuck in early access hell  so it is great to see Feels get more content
2234,Looks like a good starting/low end computer. Sure it will not play AAA games on higher settings. But some easier games on lower settings should be fine. The GPU will be your bottleneck. So that will be the thing you should save money for. (If youre gonna play games)  One thing to remember is. Never be stingy about the PSU. Remember that it powers the whole computer. If it will go bad  the possibility for other components to go bad is quite high.  Remove the monitor. Never buy a monitor that isnt at least 1080p  so go find an other one or a used one.
2235,"Looks like a reasonable HW upgrade ...like last gen was too. Amazon have done OK there in recent years.     But I still feel their software is *really* and quite deliberately awkward. Always extra clicks to get to the simplest thing  no menu interfaces seem obviously labeled  and I'm always accidentally clicking a link to store (where there was absolutely *no* indication that was where that click would take me). And can't for the life of me find a way to maximize figures  images etc. even in actual ebooks -which frankly makes these unusable for anything ""serious"". This particular point made me give up on trying to read an actual purchased .azw about 10% of the way through  as I quickly realised I was missing about 40% of the info the author had intended to convey. ....also (quibble here  perhaps) but put the ""open menu/options"" at the bottom of the screen  and not *exactly* where my thumb rests  covering the top 20% or so of the screen so that *that* is what I hit where I try to turn the page every single time. Proper file management  too  please.      I'm not sure there are ""good"" solutions in this space. I bought an expensive Chinese model with drastically better hardware ....but the OS bricked itself with I tried to boot while on zero battery. I've had more of less the same thing happen to another 3rd party not-a-phone-or-tablet (in this case Euro  rather than Chinese) android device (in that case power failure during OS update  I think?) -no way to access the boot-loader in either case. Also 3rd party Android software on the expensive Chinese thingy was not *genuinely* compatible  because on-screen OS controls were not present  and the hardware buttons did not provide a ""home"" button  in particular.   It's *so damned frustrating* having to rely on Amazon and Kobo in this space. But the market  particularly outside of people *just* wanting ""I just wanna be able to access my 1st party purchased .azws""  just does not seem to be anywhere strong enough to support proper OS and software development.    Important message for Amazon in particular: If I can but it for work or study *and actually use it for that too*  then I absolutely will have your device in hand *all the time* and *then use it for Amazon-purchases ebooks ....and probably expensive textbooks etc. too*. There is real money to be made here.       If you want to read *documents* rather than 1st party sold ebooks? Sadly  you have to but a backlit tablet today. There is just no other practicable option. We all know that  even if you can put up with the backlit display  the software experience there is pretty subpar  too (Android does not really support large screens  and iOS does not support file management properly  and relied on fucking iTunes (which is in itself enough to give anyone nightmares).     What we need here is a flexible  general purpose"" OS (a proper file manager  for starters)  proper 3rd party software support  and bootloader access. Something that can just be picked up a"
2236,Looks like the Board is an Asrock H87-Pro4 supporting Haswell series Intel CPU's with DDR3. Noting  that your CPU may also provide On board graphics. Maybe try pulling the Graphics card and plug the Blue  svga cable into the Port on the motherboard.  The CPU socket is 1150 LGA (Contacts instead of Pin)  The Board has dual Channel Memory which is slightly better for performance  You've got some rando GPU  which should have the name/make/model on it. The GPU slot is PCIE version 3.0  The Power Supply is a crap Xilence model.  CMOS - The director of traffic to all parts in the pc.  General things to check/try  Power off and disconnect the ac cable and wait about two hours for the PSU to discharge  Make sure to turn off and unplug from an outlet between reboots.  Push the lever to loosen the Graphics card  remove  and pull the CMOS Battery. It's a small nickel cadmium battery about the size of a quarter.  Place back  plug in power and try to boot. If that doesn't resolve  please change the ram to cycle through configurations and slots to test the ram as a slot could be bad.  Suspect the CMOS  PSU  or RAM at this point. Other components could be at fault.  Here's a link to the manual for the board.  [https://download.asrock.com/Manual/H87%20Pro4.pdf](https://download.asrock.com/Manual/H87%20Pro4.pdf)  *Edit - The button battery is not a NiCad. Myu Bad. Probably Lithium.*
2237,Looks much better than the current 1 series. It also has the next gen interior design from BMW. A much better buy than the 1.  I hope this kills the 1 sales because that thing is so ugly it distracts me while driving.
2238,Looks pretty good in my opinion  the badge in the grill for some reason works much better here than on the smaller Fiesta. I removed the badge in photoshop though  and it does look quite a bit sharper without it. https://i.imgur.com/UbjNEJx.jpg  And as for the ST  I think a green wagon would look pretty sick.. 
2239,Loot & Level got old. I enjoy role play over roll-play and other systems offer mechanics aimed at evoking specific themes.  Mountain Witch Dogs in the Vineyard Dread My Life With Master Contenders Lady Blackbird Wilderness of Mirrors Etc.
2240,Lots of good advice here. And lots of bad advice. You don't need to do everything yourself. Try getting one of those awesome fans to act as a proxy for you. Have someone either manage a server officially without your direct input or have a partner deal with that stuff. It'll take some work: finding someone that's easy to work with and is trustworthy. But it's possible. It just depends of how much time you're willing to work on officially supporting a community.  But seriously  getting a team together helps so much when these things become too much to handle.
2241,"Lots of people talk about benefits for India or ""the region"". That's fine  but honestly the biggest benefit is to the world. The reason is two-fold:  1. The world is overinvested in East Asia for semiconductors  so the need for geographic diversity will reduce geopolitical and economic risk.  2. The world is also starved of semiconductors  so any additional capacity brought online will have cascading effects on the entire global supply chain."
2242,Lotta focus on the shifting behavior in the comments here  but I suspect the road behavior of the transmission is distinctly secondary. The CVT is appealing because its smaller  lighter  and mechanically simpler than a conventional automatic. Better packaging means more interior space  something which Honda and Subaru notably prioritize. Less parts should bring a cost savings as well.
2243,Love Fractal. I've had a Define C Mini for the last few years and it's been an excellent case. My audio headers died a few weeks ago and I contacted support to see if I could get a new one even though I was out of warranty. I got a replacement piece for free the next week. I can't imagine buying a case from anyone else.
2244,Love the new machines  they feel faster and stronger than the old Juggernauts. Considering Shin had to always go for the legs with the old machine  this one being able to go directly for the turret shows how cool it is. Plus it even has a proper cockpit screen instead of the retina display  so it really feels more fancy.
2245,"Love them or hate them  Apple pushing/marketing 120hz on the new iPhone will really help push 120hz VRR from ""enthusiast"" to ""mainstream"". Glad to finally see it!  I'm sure we'll get some 240hz android models soon."
2246,Loved it  that e21 purrs. Late model carburetion is my idea of a good drivable vintage car  completely mechanical with spits and burble accompaniment  but relatively reliable  so it starts at the end of the day and you get home safely.
2247,Lufia II  the story takes a little bit to get going but the dungeon design is top notch  excellent puzzles and gameplay from the get-go. Very straightforward and great pacing. I would relate it most closely to Grandia in it's overall pacing and design  but totally turn based and better dungeons/puzzles.
2248,Lupin III returns with a blast! Now we get London as a main scene  so of course  there is Sherlock Holmes. Anime just doesn't work when London doesn't have Sherlock Holmes and Jack the Reaper  it's obligatory. Local variant of SH doesn't remind me of his potential relatives from Part II/canon rather Moriarty's one after an enormous stress. Anyway plot about him and (potentially) dead Watson's daughter  several police fractions and Raven thickens  can't wait to see more! Gonna be waiting how writers will approach continuity - like p4/p5 or like p2 (1st episode tried to establish a timeline  no one cared later. And I don't even talking about several Holmses!). I have hopes this part Lupin will be more like his early p1 version. Or if they play with duality of early p1 and rest of p1 Lupin it could be fun  too. Plus Oshii episode most likely will be ~~shitpost~~ quite silly.  P.S. So far Ootsuka sounds more like Ootsuka than Jigen  but we'll see.
2249,Made it a point to drive on the autobahn when I was in Munich. Loved pinning the governor on my rental. Even at autobahn speed  I never felt unsafe  because all the other drivers were committed to the task at hand. No phone  no eating  limited distractions.  The autobahn really is a speed-lover's dream.  Humbling when an 80's Rabbit blows by you doing 140mph  though.
2250,Madoka Magica should have ended at Eternal movie arc because the ending for Eternal is more positive. Rebellion basically destroyed my hopes for a good ending to the series.  Darling in the Franxx - remove the other half.
2251,Mages are by far the strongest class in the game  and have an interesting role in the story and lore of the Dragon Age universe. If you're in doubt as to which class to select  go with mage  but you really can't go wrong with either of the others. Keep in mind a dwarf cannot be a mage.   If you plan on playing the entire trilogy  it might be wise to decide which class you want to play in each game  since it might get old playing the same class every time. That said  plenty of people go the same class for all 3 games  so take that with a grain of salt. If you ask me  DA2 is much better if you play as a mage.   You will want a character called Wynne in your party unless you have a dedicated healer. When you come to the point in the game when you have several choices as to where to go  go to the Circle first to get her. You will know what I mean when you get there.  Unlike Mass Effect  there is no morality system  so you are free to role play as whatever sort of character you wish and make decisions as you please  just keep in mind your party members will either approve or disapprove of your actions.   You can stop and have a conversation with your companions at pretty much any point outside of combat  you do not have to wait to be at the equivalent of the Normandy to talk to people.   When you get to a place called Ostagar early on  make sure you speak with the Kennel master.   You can buy a backpack to increase inventory size  do this as early as you can to avoid frustration.   I'm sure there's tons of stuff I'm not thinking of but this is off the top of my head. If you have any questions just ask.
2252,Magical swordsman like Zelos\Kratos from Tales of Symphonia not just magic powered attacks but characters that can use a sword and shield but also heal and know a few spells. I like the multitool characters
2253,Magnets! I have magnets on most of my dungeon tiles  and magnets bits of steel on the bottom of my minis. So the minis go into some cheap art supply boxes I got from a craft store  that I've hot glued magnets into  so they don't move around.  Terrain goes in some big flat plastic  containers I've put a few strips of steel in.  All in all cost me maybe $60 usd spread over a few years  but I can transport whole dungeons and armies no issue.
2254,Main characters are generally safest to use them on since they are 100% unlikely to exit the party at all or for any length of time. If it known that none of the characters leave I generally give it them to shore up weaknesses or improve strengths.
2255,Make a game.  Just pick the simplest thing you can think of. First I wanted to render a background. Well this cute little library can handle that. Okay  check. Now I want to put a player sprite *here*. Okay  cool. Now I want to move it with the keyboard. Awesome  that's a game now! Okay  let's animate that sprite a run cycle. Sweet  after a bunch of debugging it's working. Okay  I just drew a bundle of grass  let's randomly place these all over. Awesome  but now the player just floats over them. Time to learn how to manage draw order. This is great  it looks so good! Running around grass  running around grass  this is way more satisfying than I expected. Let's do *lots* of grass! EVEN MORE GRA- *oh shit the fps is reaaally bad now*. Hmm  how do I fix that? Okay  looks like this library can't do that. I guess that's why most games don't have so many individual grasses  just a backgro- youknowwhat TO HELL with that  I did not know this about myself but apparently having lots and lots of grass is SUPER important to me and I refuse to compromise  time to learn about OpenGL and the graphics pipeline.  *One week later*  Alright  I have re-done all of the steps above in OpenGL and we can literally draw A. Million. Grasses. without an fps drop. Fuck yeah. My grass running game is fucking sweet. I am so fucking pumped.  Now we're gonna make some fucking flowers.
2256,"Make interesting decisions.  * Risk vs. Reward  * Speed vs. Reward  * Information vs. Speed   * Morality vs. Reward  * morality vs. Information  * danger vs. Different danger  * Reward vs. Different reward  * freedom vs. Justice (i.e.  you pass a slow criminal wagon heading to a remote jail with cruel guards abusing convicts).  * Travel problems with multiple solutions  Stuff like that.   Players could look at all of the above and say ""I ignore it  keep going"". In that case that probably happened because travel speed is urgently important in your quest  in which case you probably made the destination too interesting relative to the travel stops. You can adjust this by making the goal of the quest to ""find something"" or ""map this area"" or ""find a good spot to build a town""."
2257,Makes no sense to me  to have all micro usb replaced by usb c is logical but what if theres a new better connector completely different from usb whatsoever in a couple years ? I feel like standardization slows innovation. Should be the choice of manufacturers to implement whatever the fuck they want  and the shouldnt be prevented to come up with better technologies
2258,Making a game that will have several human npc characters and looking for tools that can help me make them.   I quite like MakeHuman  but wanted to ask if anyone knew of any other ones?   Preferably free  also keen to hear about any low poly character creation tools as well.
2259,Making the full thing from scratch involves typography  editing  organizing (maybe creating) images  making a system  testing it   et c.  If you use an existing system  and simply make a supplement for it  then that covers a lot of the work  and anyone thinking of playing your game has a better chance of already knowing the system.  Fate Core's a great system as it's very flexible. If you want something crunchier  GURPs has a supplement for literrally any setting or genre.
2260,Man  I totally feel you. I come from the same background and ran into a very similar feeling at one point. So much so that I decided to start building a platform to help other indie devs along their journey. (You can sign up for updates at https://indiegamedev.io if youre interested)  There is SO much work that goes into even the simplest of games and it took me about 5 years of game Dev before I felt like I could make the game I was wanting to make. And Im almost two years into making it without a fully playable release  so trust me  I get the struggle. Fortunately the indie game dev community is one of the greatest out there and there are tons of great  knowledgeable people willing to help  so make sure you get connected. Thats actually one of the major things Im hoping this platform Im building can help with. Stay hopeful man  once you can get over some the challenges  game dev really can be amazing when you can finally put a level together the way you wanted to. Feel free to pm me too. Take care.
2261,Man  I was pretty certain you were older than me until you started talking about one night stands and college life. You talk like you're in your fifties!  College life can be cool too  make sure you enjoy it  you will always have (some) time for RPGs later. In my case  after graduating I realized a newfound love for pen&paper (more like screen&mouse nowadays).  Kudos to you for your perspective on getting wasted  though. Way too overrated. It makes you lose precious time  and it's great you learned to appreciate in moderation while young.
2262,Man  my '96 Eclipse GSX has skyrocketed in value in the past two years. Luckily  mine is rust free  I'm the third owner  about 112k miles. It was completely stock when I bought it   but was absolutely neglected in terms of maintenance. I sunk about $3k into maintenance  immediately. But now it's reliable. I can turn the key and start it up. I am absolutely doing tasteful mods. Larger turbo  injectors  fuel pump  fuel pressure regulator  exhaust  hard intercooler pipes  ECMLink  gauges  etc. Most will be reversible  with the exception of the wiring harness modifications for the boost gauge and wideband.  My Dad on the other hand... He is a Corvair fan  but appreciates a stock only approach. I drive mine whenever I can. It's technically a collector car (25+ years old). You can get agreed upon fair value through certain insurance providers.
2263,Man  The 86 dont ever get a break do they. Giad Military thinks of them as combat loving people when they only know combat  while the San Magnolia people(I think thats what theyre called iirc) dont even think of them as humans. Glad to see Shins comeback as the reaper  even if it costed him his first new friend of Giad.
2264,Man I feel your pain. I had to sell my mu tang thats been in the family for 53 years. I owned it since I graduated and loved it but I just didnt have the time to drive it. The pandemic started  the wife got laid off and I didnt know how secure my work season was going to be this year. I havent touched the money and want to keep saving to buy another one day  when were back to being more financially stable.   Its a bummer but as you pointed out this is practically the only time you would be able to sell it for a profit so soon after buying it.
2265,Man I know this all too well. Got rid of my fun car a few years back for similar reasons. It didnt make sense financially to hang on to it. Havent got another car since.   Silver lining for my wife and I  is it helped us get our first house  afford the right vehicle for her business  spend less on gas  etc. Also  due to the pandemic I ended up working from home full time  so I wouldnt have been driving my car anyways.   I still miss my car a lot  but I never want a car payment again. So if I want a fun car  Im buying it in cash.
2266,man I was thinking with a few minutes left that after this episodes over I cant wait to go to Reddit and make a joke about how hes so dead next episode.  now I just feel silly for thinking itd take that long
2267,Man that argument between Will and Gus was hard to watch  but I really wonder when we will learn about the lore in this world  Will is already 13  and he theorizes that the town and his 3 parents where ruined before his birth  so why would his parents give their child to three undead... also there are a lot of demon corpses in a city that was inhabited by humans and dwarfs...
2268,Man that was a brutal end to an episode. I really liked Eris's grandfather. I wish we could have seen more of him.  I love how positive Rudy was about the prison. Just chilling in there.  The fight was so epic. I am glad he used water magic to put out the fire. Most anime OPs will just leave it as it. Rudy is a degenerate OP but atleast he is smart.
2269,Man that was one great way for Lupin and Sherlock to meet though I am curious on how Lilly know Lupin and what happen to Watson. Well it was nice to see Arthur back even if it was only for a bit. Love the new rendition of the open and the mid episode title cards.
2270,"man that was some crazy timeskipping  I don't even remember Eugene mentioning that he was going to enlist (did he? edit: went back  yeah he said it) and then the episode opens with him sitting in a cockpit next to Shin  no ""hey how you doin fancy meeting you here"" type scene for that  one whole scene of training and then we're on the battlefield after the fido scene was kinda wtf too  I have to assume it's been several months and no doubt dates have been appearing on screen and I just haven't bothered looking at them  I didn't really mind the timeskip to eugene's death since they raised the flags so hard that they may as well have just cut to the point. I feel like I'd be able to get more invested in the show if they actually showed the battle and his struggle that led up to that though"
2271,Many languages have built in array filter function.   You can filter items by whatever value.  Other  better option is to have json with all items and from it you create temporary array with items needed.   Json is a bit more friendly for complex structures  like if you wt items to have very different stats and types.
2272,Many people were excited about intel coming into the GPU game  as it would help supply.  If Intel are just going to use TSMC and compete with AMD for capacity then this isn't going to help supply at all.
2273,Many supercars  I think. They look cool at any age  allways have  allways will. Porsche 911 has it nailed down pretty much.  Regarding regular cars:   The Mini  Many Audis age well. A5 lasts surprisingly long for me.  Suzuki Swift  VW Beetle and PT Cruiser for their standout design.  Nissan Skyline GTR  what a block.  The Mercedes SL R230   BMW 6 series F13
2274,Many years ago I need a cheap car to drive over the winter while I was restoring an MGB Roadster I found an 1983 Toyota starlet 1.3 GT MK 1 it had factory alloy wheels spotlights 5 speed gearbox and a lovely black cloth interior it drove really well and I drove it for about 18 months while working on the MG ironically now the starlet is worth a fortune and a lot more than the Mg would be if only Id kept both of them 
2275,Marketing and sales BS! I wanted CVT that can stay optimal torque all the time but got a stupid one that doesn't give torque if you treat it normally and fakes gears when you punch it. Like  I needed torque when I punch it  not discontinued power delivery every fake gear shift.
2276,Mary Skelter Nightmares.  Combat is turn-based  but the dungeons have hazards and bosses that chase you in real time.    You have a party of predetermined characters  but you pick their classes and active abilities carry over.  Between battles  there's a light Social Link type system similar to Persona.  You can give party members gifts to unlock new abilities and new event scenes with them.
2277,Maschine Zeit is sci-fi flavored but may suit your needs  too. I havent run it  but like the flavor of the book. It would benefit from more examples of gameplay if I recall. It is specifically aimed at one shot mimics of sci-fi horror movies like The Thing  Event Horizon  and Pandorum.  I also second Dread for this for a rules light game.
2278,Matt Farah mentioned it on a recent podcast that Beverly Hills is all Taycans. He guessed that the people who wanted the luxury EV clout and can afford such weren't too happy with the build quality of the Model S or Model X.
2279,Maybe a dumb question but I quit my job back in July and after several attempts of contacting my manager to return my equipment they never got back to me. Its now October and I was looking through it and cleared it off and was thinking of using it as a personal computer. If everything is off and it looks like it back to new  can it be tracked or anything? Thank you!
2280,"Maybe don't roll everything for your starting characters? It is just fundamentally unsatisfying  because of the utterly stupid power differentials between characters.  But if you want to do rolled characters  everything is rolled openly in front of everyone else. No ""rolling at home""."
2281,Maybe is your true calling. Writing rpgs. Try to concentrate in one single rpg  from beginning to the end. But just one  get the full experience  planning  writing the general ideas  make an outline  write  and edit  finally publish or just give it away for free as a pdf download. And when you have imprinted in your brain the experience  then it will leave you alone to enjoy movies because you will know the entire process. And not everything  works for an rpg.    If this doesnt work then check out this subs and they might help.   r/maladaptivedreaming  r/adhd
2282,Maybe just most new games are boring? Or i need a break from gaming? Like im playing pathfinder getting lore dumps getting text after text  Leveling up getting companions even more lore dumps.  And i just have this feeling in the back of my head that keep coming up. Is this worth it? Why am i doing this? Am i having fun? Like why invest in the lore? Why listen too this digital npc person why level up. All i wanna do is skip the text and kill stuff but even that gets boring.  I cant remember the last time i enjoyd a game or completed one. Last one was dishonored 2 and so far no other game have captured the no bullshit gameplay style that game has. Wanna skip the story? Go ahead. Wanna play your way? Go ahead. Wanna kill everything? Go ahead. No lore dumps or stuff like that just pure gameplay its your sandbox.  I alos keep getting stuck in this genre mindset. Like why am i playing this game? I like RPGs i must play RPGs cause im the RPG guy. And then i play a rpg walk around look around kill a cat. Maybe fun for 10 min then i get bored and sad cause im the RPG guy i should love this.  Maybe gaming in general is fading for me?  I mostly just play fast online games now like TFT or battlefield 4. Its fun i like it. Or total war i still love total war.  Should i move away from this personality mindset that im so legendary RPG gamer lol? Should i move away from games in general  Am i just stupid? Am i just sad? Am i just a speck in the huge space. Like the fucking shitt is worng with me? Why am i not ENJOYING THINGS TOO THE FULLEST! Why do i gotta ask whats the point when playing a dam game.
2283,Maybe my 2002 WRX Wagon? I bought a clean example with dealer-installed Cobb Stage 2 bits from the 2nd owner a decade ago for a very fair price and have kept it well-maintained with modifications being limited to reliability and QOL improvements. Looking at Cars and Bids and some other listings I could do alright if I wanted to sell it now. Maybe that ass-tastic reveal of the new WRX helped raise interest in the older models as well.
2284,Maybe the ghosts become a bit visible in stuff like smoke and fog. This could be used for some spooky effects when the players can spot somebody moving through the fog outside the house or being attacked through the smoke a cigar.
2285,Maybe they should try not releasing every single individual piece of everything as a $14.99 DLC and having 400+ DLC's for all of their games with no season pass  and many of the DLC's only exist for extermely obscure specific things you are unlikely to encounter in-game.  Just release full expansions or a complete game.
2286,Maybe try a different breed of RPG to keep things fresh. Every play a pure dungeon crawler? Many of them have little if any story or dialogue  and mostly focus on the mechanical/gameplay side of the genre.
2287,Maybe you could tell what style of postgame you have in mind. If is just grinding through dungeons and beating stronger bosses its bad. If there is a continuation of the story its good.  I think you could  add choices or multiple endings and a New game + where you keep your levels. I like to replay games if they have choices  but I dont like the post-endgame infinte dungeon or dungeon with 100 floors style.  So if you want to implement expansive postgame content it should be something meaningful and not grinding. Many people love games like DA since you can replay them with different routes  romances  etc.  When postgame is just mindless grind and a random 100-floor tower  most people will quit because they dont feel it is worth their time since they have already beaten the game. While if the game had different routes/romances like in DA people could replay it to experience different story paths.  If you are eager on implementing expansive postgame content instead of a New Game + I recommend you to look up **Rune Factory 4 Special postgame content**. In this game its a continuation of the story where you have to save your friend you lost at some time.  I wish you best luck with your game! :)
2288,Maybe you dont like RPGs they are not for everyone. Dishonoured 2 is a great game but maybe the aspects you liked about it are not the RpG elements . The game does a good job of letting you play and soak in lore while you fight and move through the missions .   Thats a very far cry away from Pathfinder and other isometric games which are based on story and plot . Pathfinder in particular is made for a type of player that is hardcore into RPgs   lore and world building.   I would recommend trying games that you love and not trying to force yourself into RPGs because or what was your perception of what type of games you used to enjoy . To me it seems like your ffocus and what brings you joy is multiplayer FPS . Your free time / life is too short to spend not doing what you like . Play what you like .    I also thought I loved story and plot but the games I seem to enjoy now are hardcore strategy RPGs like Darkest Dungeon  Battle Brothers and XCom . They have next to know story but I really geek out over the random generated missions and fights and building the ideal party composition really  WS it for me . I felt guilty for so long since what I use to love about RPGs was complex narratives . But just sit back and soak in what you like and what brings you joy . Ex
2289,Maybe you should follow a JS course on Udemy. I am a Javascript developer and there is a lot to learn about it. At this point you basically are trying to create your own engine.  Using a framework like React or Angular could help you a lot. Both using very different ways to achieve the same thing. With vanilla you need to think about lots of things those frameworks already think about.  Good luck and if you have some questions you can pm me. Maybe I can help you get into the right direction.
2290,Maybe you should try out a shorter one. Tyranny is about 20 hrs  is a great game and had a lot of replayability as there are divergent story paths. Made by the same people who made Pillars of Eternity.
2291,Mazda Protege5  nice clean looking wagon (especially in the factory yellow)  handling was pretty sharp out of the box. Let down by a dog of a motor and the worst rust proofing ever  you could almost hear the metal oxidizing on a quiet night.
2292,Melee all the way every time. I used to be crazy obsessed on dual wielding (I blame TMNT's Leo and Raph for that)  then I swung to the other way and mostly play big beefy 2handers. For Path of Exile's newest expac  I played a dual wielding glass cannon speed demon of a [Berserker](https://pathofexile.gamepedia.com/Berserker) after playing [Juggernaut](https://pathofexile.gamepedia.com/Juggernaut) ('big guy' ur-tank) or [Champion](https://pathofexile.gamepedia.com/Champion) (a more balanced tank  not lacking in damage) for a while. Although  I am warming up to the idea of melee battle-mages after playing a [Cipher](https://pillarsofeternity.gamepedia.com/Cipher) (psion/mind-mage) in Pillars of Eternity 1 and Deadfire. Also rarely  monks. My latest character in Deadfire is a Cipher/Monk.
2293,Metal Gear Solid V. If you like stealth games at all  this is a must play. It's the most detailed stealth system I think I have seen.     There's lots of gadgets to play with  you can throw empty mags for distractions  and there's plenty of things you can try that end up in those moments like...    Disabling enemy electronics with a water gun  forcing soldiers to drown themselves by having them surrender facedown in a river  having your horse defecate in the road to make enemy jeeps spin out. A lot more practical stuff as well.    The open world and story is a bit jank. It gets confusing  though I did like the ending.
2294,Might be a little old but I always thought Patlabor was one of the best mecha related shows  really grounded which I enjoy. Especially the movies  they're really well animated and have some gorgeous shots.
2295,Mine are usually warrior/knights that use 2 handed greatswords or lancers or dragoon (or at least something similar to dragoon that relies on spears and jumping attacks) on aesthetic level dragoon is my favorite class ever  and it also on gameplay level  usually if the rpg I'm playing I choose the 2 handed warrior  I wish there were more classes that uses spears  (lancers technically don't count since it's their name)  tell me what are you favorite classes in the comments  I really hope there will be other dragoon enjoyers like me here
2296,Mine just doesn't sleep at all. lt just ignores the command. If I close the lid  it will stay on and go to the lock screen. I have to hibernate every time.  Also it sometimes doesn't recognise the insertion of headphones. I have to go to Task Manager and kill all of the Realtek processes for it to work again.
2297,Mine likes to throw a shit fit sometimes  turn off the computer  then turn off the power supply for 30 seconds  if it is still acting up  unplug the wifi adapter  turn on the computer once with it removed  then shut it down and plug it back in.
2298,Mini campaigns! Start the players at a little higher level to have a full tool kit and play the story for a full  complete and satisfying arc. Then once its down  move onto the next game.   I have a group that between arcs of DnD 5e  we play a mini campaign of other games. We played an awesome game of Kids on Bikes that has been my absolute favorite thing Ive ever run as a GM. And in a few months well play Wanderhome.   It allows me to leave new systems and experiment. It also gives the players time to stretch their muscles with new characters  settings and systems!
2299,Mitsubishi 3000gt vr4. Fwd non-vr4 is truly worthless but even the vr4 as super cool as it is was so incredibly a pain in the ass to own at this point that there is no use owning one. Too many better options for the price.
2300,Mixing and Matching jobs: FFV  FF TACTICS  FF TACTICS ADVANCE and A2  Bravely Default series  Dragon Age Origins  Class/job heavy but not really mixing jobs on the same unit: Fire Emblem series  Disgaea Series  Tyranny  Dragon Age 2   Dragon Age Inquisition  Darkest Dungeon
2301,Mod... well  not much.  I own two 356s  one is a family heirloom survivor with original paint so it doesnt see much use  maybe 200 miles a year just to keep it exercised.  The other... kinda modded  its a B coupe and I drive it less than Id like but a couple thousand miles a year.  I have the stock engine for it but it runs a somewhat custom built engine made by arguably the greatest 356 engine builder of all time that produces probably 120hp vs the stock 90hp (its a Super 90).   Other than that  the car is pretty much stock aside from a 12v conversion and Komi shocks.  I drive it like I stole it and hammer the thing every time I drive it  and the car loves it.  I also own a 58 Pontiac but thats not a car that likes being beaten on but I will go fast in a straight line in it.  It just handles like a Sea Ray.  That car is stock except for a hidden electronic ignition inside the distributor.
2302,More likely that the memory will be 14g gbps not 16. The mining yield leaks we've seen seem to suggest that. Also  the PRO W6600 using the same 28cu die  has 14gbps memory. Although  maybe that means more OC headroom.
2303,More or less any game studio would potentially do this. You're talking about being a publisher and this is a common publisher-developer interaction. The publisher finds some game studios that could potentially build their game  reaches out  negotiates  and funds development in return for the revenue with the developer getting a royalty cut.  As long as you've got the money to finance the entire development of a game  which could be from tens of thousands to many millions depending on what you have in mind  there's always someone willing to take your money.
2304,Morrowind is actually a really bad choice for roleplay.  You will be forced to do some things your character wouldn't normally do  especially if you are not playing a mage.  You'll also be forced to cheese through some parts of the game. Oblivion and Skyrim (if you use mods to get rid of the dragonborn obligations) are better picks for roleplaying. There's cheeseing on these too  but you don't need to use any. If you don't cheese through Morrowind you WILL have a bad time. The Morrowind case is more due to nostalgia and entitlement of the old TES fans than a good RPG.  It has great lore  heck  it built the foundation for the other TES games' lore. But that's all there is to it  lore and good writing. Makes for a good book  but a terrible game.  The ones I recommend are Fallout 1 and 2  and New Vegas.  Fallout 1 and 2 are great games if you don't mind the top down play  but New Vegas is my personal favorite.  You can be anything you want on New Vegas  I recommend you don't look up videos about the game on YouTube  just play it and enjoy it. Create a dumb 1 intelligence idiot with 10 strength and walk around the wasteland bullying everyone with droll on your mouth  or maybe pick 7 charisma and get the Terrifying Presence perk as fast as you can  and scare the shit out of Caesar's little dogs  or even make a 1 strength 10 intelligence cocky know it all nerd  I guarantee you will find your poison playing that game  to this day it surprises me with the choices it offers.
2305,Most Dragon Quest games follow an episodic format  I recommend 5 if it's your first one  but pretty much any one in the series will fit that. Someone else recommended Phantasy Star IV and it's also a really good recommendation  the game is fun and the story isn't hard to follow in short play sessions.  This one is a bit older and harder to get into  but I recommend Ultima 7 as well. The main story can be a bit confusing to follow but the world is open and there's a lot of short sidequests in each town. It's a very dialogue heavy game where combat definitely wasn't the developers's focus so it might not be your thing but i found it very enjoyable to just get lost into for a few hours every now and then and explore the world a bit and do a few sidequests.
2306,Most engines will have something you can use for 3d sound. You'll have to add logic and effects on top of that to achieve the desired result though. LOS checks  low pass filters to make it sound muffled  reverb for interior spaces  etc
2307,most laptops have the hard drive held in with screws  but  some don't--it's possible that your drive was knocked loose...so...try opening the back and checking that everything is properly fit  maybe unplug/replug hard drive connection (and check to see if your if your ram is well seated)...then see if it boots.  *note: I worked on a laptop (Compaq Presario/HP G6000) recently that the hard drive just slid into some clips--no screws--it almost fell into my hand when I opened the back.*
2308,Most modern rpgs dont have the gameplay density old rpgs had. What I am missing in the new ones is that you just can start the game and go straight on an adventure with some twists and a good-paced story. In fact  the pacing in newer rpgs is rather bad. I got bored by the new ones and started to replay the old rpgs I have.   From the modern games what did scratch the itch for me are some kemco games (but they are hit-or miss). I liked Sephirotic Stories and Alvastia Chronicles the most: they are old-schoolish and have a good pacing. If you like the old FFs like 1-5 you will like Alvastia Chronicles since the story has some  similarities.  If no rpg appeals to you try either playing some other genre (metroidvania  jump and run or point and click adventures). Metroidvania: *Castlevania games  Bloodstained*. Point and click: *Big Fish games* have very good ones  Jump and run: *Goblin Sword  Mario*  If games from the other genre dont appeal to you  too  try to make a gaming break. *Works wonders*. Watch some movies  read books  play some board games  go hiking  etc. Just deal with something else and not video games  so that your mind can rest from gaming. After that when you come back to rpgs after some months (or half a year or a whole year)  you will like them again.
2309,Most RPGs are dumb and boring  because its the players playing it that brings it life. It sounds like your creativity is leaving RPGs behind - whether it settles on regular story writing  or if it settles on things that bring you money  thats ok. We get older  and things that used to be fun become played-out or tired. We have to find new things.
2310,Most RPGs by Fria Ligan (Alien  Coriolis  Mutant  etc.) handle simplicity/realism quite well in their combat. It's also fairly hackable  so you can alter your preferred lethality/complexity most of the time.
2311,Most stealth and or open world based games are structured so you have multiple ways to complete objectives.  You can sneak in and out undetected  or you can go spray and pray  and anywhere inbetween. Usually you can get very creative with traps  explosives  and things in the environment. Games like: Sniper Elite 4  Generation Zero  MetalGearSolid V  Thief  Deus Ex Invisible War  etc.
2312,Most ttrpg groups are dnd.   Ironically all of my friends play some version of pathfinder as their preferred game. A couple play dnd when they have an itch to play a game n can't find a pathfinder game.
2313,Mother 3 - the sequel to EarthBound. You'll need to play the fan translation via emulator (unless you speak Japanese) but it's a wonderful  heartbreaking story that contrasts wacky humour and colourful characters with darker themes around family and materialism.  Some of my other faves are Chrono Trigger  Final Fantasy VI  Super Mario RPG and the first two Paper Mario games  Fire Emblem: Awakening  Lisa  Pokemon HeartGold and SoulSilver (widely considered some of the best Pokegames)  Undertale  Stardew Valley (farming sim but has RPG elements).
2314,Mothership is a game where the characters will stumble upon super interesting situations and horrific mysteries. And be woefully under equipped to actually survive them.  Youll have to accept as a player (and GM) that the characters will fail most of the attempts they make at doing anything requiring a roll.
2315,Move along  not really for your average PC consumer/gamer.   4 grand is what you ask your company to pay if you are a professional media editor  but this is not a product targeted to your average neckbeard sweaty gamer with an RGB setup.
2316,MS apparently claimed they made notable improvements to their pen tech for the new slim pen 2:  Zero forcing inking (low initial activation force  a must-have for illustrators/creatives).   Haptic feedback that emulates surface textures  supposedly  Better accuracy  hopefully that means the line wobble is virtually eliminated.  Faster response/low latency input response  especially with the adaptive 120hz refresh rate for the screen (similar to the S21 Ultra S-pen I'm guessing).  The Surface Pro 8 might be a viable option for artists again  after years of having an awful pen experience compared to competing solutions. No word on tilt or rotation  but apparently they also said the pen would be incredible for shading  so maybe there's an improvement to tilt too. The improvements to the pen are probably the most interesting thing to me  just because they're coming from a position of weakness. If everything is as good as it sounds they might be catching up to Wacom EMR in one fell swoop.
2317,"Multiplayer web based game could be a lot of things.  From ""simple"" websites like OGame to webgl shooters.  If it's like the first thing  you only need a webhosting  some php scripts to write and read from a database  and some pages with simple Javascript that read and display that info.  If it's the second  I would go with Godot or unity  make the game that will in reality be played like a local game. Just make a normal multiplayer game  as if it were for windows  export to html5  and then upload the files to itchio  or to your own webhosting if you like that better. And if this is the case  I recommend more Godot. Because the files aren't so bloated."
2318,"My '70 wagoneer (last of the Kaiser era with the factory GM powertrain Buick 350  razor grille etc) I bought for a couple grand because I figured it would be easy to use it to haul surf boards etc around in since the rear window rolls down and the 2nd row folds forward.  Then the markets shifted upwards and every gal started watching that ""This Is Us"" show and now men and women always want to buy my Wagoneer."
2319,My attainable dream car. Second would be a tie between the GR 86 and the upcoming GR Corolla (if it comes to existence of course).  I'm a big fan of coupe hatchbacks. With so many of them gone and the Veloster being kept to SK and US  this feels really special to me. Plus  it's got 4WD.  Which would be the best country to own one in?
2320,"My AW11 isn't exactly a classic  but I bought it a decade ago when it was just an obscure old Toyota that was neither fast nor practical  and the best examples were fetching similar money to a nondescript 10 year old corolla....  Fast forward to the J-tin boom  vapourwave trends and 80's revival of the 20's  and it's almost tripled in value - still not exactly big money (and not worth as much as contemporaneous cars like the 86) but it definitely feels like it's gone from ""old Toyota"" to ""cool 80's 'JDM' coupe"" in some people's minds.  In some ways it's nice  because it's easier to justify maintaining it when I know it's worth more than I'm spending  but at the same time I feel like I've got more to lose if I prang it or ding it."
2321,My car 2005 Nissan Sunny N16 (called Pulsar in Australia and New Zealand and Almera in Europe) didn't come with fog lights  and I just found a set of OEM light with the light/turn signal stalk  so my question  is it easy to install? Are the wiring harness already there and it's a matter of plug-and-play? Or should i do weird wiring?
2322,My car started breaking down a lot  leaving me stranded  costing me a fortune and I still cried when I sold it. Actual tears. Right decision  but I was very attached.  My mom  same thing with her last car.  So I dont know what to tell you other than youre not alone.
2323,My car. 2016 SS. Car guys knew about it when new. No one wanted to buy it. It wasn't even my first choice but the practicality of the full rear seat fit my needs.  I bought the car for 25% off MSRP.   5 years on I can sell the car for more than I paid for it  people seem to know about the car and love it.  It's pretty rare.   I love it.
2324,My current car has an I-5. It's a best-of-both-worlds compromise: the power of a four-cylinder and the fuel economy of a six-cylinder. Oh wait  that's the worst of both worlds. Well  at least it's reliable. But there's a reason you don't see them too often anymore.
2325,My Dad  As soon as I could hold a spanner he taught me how to work on cars  bikes  mowers etc. Early enough that I don't know what it is like to not know this stuff  My Mrs only got interested after learning to drive about 3 years ago and no doubt from listening to me drone on about them for hours :)   What aspect are you are interested in ? for me it's the mechanical side  I love rebuilding something and making it work smoothly and perfectly.
2326,My Dad bought one of these with a Ryzen R7 5700G  16gig ram  1tb nvme ssd and an 3060ti... For the price of what a single 3060ti would have cost him at that time. The cpu cooler looks janky  but does its job surprisingly well. The whole build is pretty low noise when gaming. The graphics card is hp custom but looks like it has a decent cooler. All Temps are fine while gaming. So yeah... actually one of the best pcs he ever bought price wise  while at least for him no drawbacks. Would he have a couple of fps more with a custom build and an 5600x  probably. Does he care? Definitely not
2327,My dad had a G37S coupe with the 5 speed automatic and my God that was such a fast car. Every time I drove it  it felt like the car was telling me to go faster and push harder. That was probably peak Nissan in North America since we didnt get the Silvia or GT-R  excluding R35.
2328,My dad use to take me to the financial district in San Francisco all the time when he was babysitting me in the 90s and there were always these super nice cars parked by the banks. My dad recognized the brands but not the car and eventually when the internet came along  I started nerding out about it.
2329,My dad was always into Motorsports as a kid  so I grew up watching a lot of F1 and Indycar.  We never had cool cars really  but he had wealthier friends that did  lol  so I got to see a bunch of cool cars up close early on  and I loved (and still love) collecting models.
2330,My ex gifted me a Kindle Paperwhite for Christmas just a few short months after the first generation was released back in 2012. That's almost an entire decade  and it includes moves across the US  international travel throughout Europe  and being lost once or twice. It still works great!     Finally Amazon is getting into territory where I would consider upgrading. But I just have this sinking feeling like it'll break two months after upgrading. (=
2331,My ex had a V35 coupe that wasnt a perfect performance car  but performed perfectly for over 200 000 miles until a distracted driver decided to put his van inside the trunk.  We were both so impressed with everything that car did.  It was fun to drive and extremely reliable. She went out and bought a V37 and I came home with a V36 not long after the accident.
2332,My favorite is the dark knight. I love the aesthetic and silly edgelord/emo aspect of the characters. Cecil from FFIV was my favorite JRPG character when I was a young teen. Currently maining a Dark Knight in FFXIV  and as a huge Berserk fan I love being able to use a giant greatsword as well.
2333,My favorite Kindle is still one of the early ones with the physical page turn buttons. Felt so satisfying to press that edge button and flip the page.   Then I got a Voyage  which has haptic feedback for buttons. Its not bad  but nowhere near as good. IMO  the design of these devices has only gone backwards.
2334,My favourite is an adventure I created for Pathfinder 2e.  The players were exploring a new tundra area. The player's magic fluctuated in power level as they explored until they figured out someone was trying to summon an evil god and it was messing with the lay lines. They built a coalition of warriors from the remote tribes and assaulted a mountain full of mind controlled orcs  preventing the summoning of the evil god. Was so close to not working it was very tense at the end.
2335,My favourite part of an RPG is building a character  agonizing over the details in the character sheet and setting them loose on the world (e.g. Daggerfall  Morrowind  Fallout 1 and 2) but it seems like more modern games are turning away from this old CRPG formula and becoming more story focused not that I don't like story but some of my favourite moments in old Fallout was when you were given a mission (breaking into the Sierra Depot) and figuring out what to do without any guidance and these moments seem to lack recently  so are there any good rpgs that are like this that I haven't mentioned? I'm happy to clarify anything if needed
2336,My FC RX7 TII. I had one a decade and a half ago I used to autox  sold it for 2k (but that was about average back then). They were cheap and plentiful back then  and rotaries scare people away. Always wanted another and a few years back I picked up a really clean example. Took a lomg time to find one a drift kiddy hadn't destroyed. It was pricey  but it's stock and clean and low mileage so I was happy to find it. Since then the price on them has exploded. Bring a trailer has multiple examples in similar or worse shape than mine going for well into the mid 20k range (and a 2200 mile example just sold for over 60k!)
2337,My first car is only a shell with doors and trunk nowadays but Im still kind of sentimental of letting it go... Best way to cope for me has been selling every functioning part and using plenty to breath life into the other e36s Ive owned.  It got killed by rust and final nail in the coffin was attempted robbery where they destroyed the door locks and alot of the interior. It is nice to know that its parts still live on in more than dozen e36s.   I still have the shell as said  and for its final hail mary I will repurpose the central locking  rear and front arches  rear subframe and brakes for my tds
2338,My first car was a B13 Sentra 4dr with the 1.6l engine and I'd wanted an SE-R for quite a while. I picked one up in 2015 and they have appreciated in value since then  but nothing crazy.  It may never turn heads for anyone except certain enthusiasts  but that's fine with me.
2339,"My first car was a Honda Prelude  I didn't know much about cars but I liked them  and I enjoyed it enough that I bought another (a manual VTEC this time).  Some 12 or so years after I sold that Prelude  I bought another one as a weekender. I tend to drive it every day  over my RWD V8.  To some people it's not about ticking boxes but how the car feels as a whole  and there is a lot of FWD coupes out there that are good and fun cars to drive  warts and all. I've never felt like the Prelude is ""less car"" because it is front wheel drive  it simply is what it is."
2340,My first car was a Nissan Sentra SE-R that was previously owned by an old man who drove it to church once a week. My mother assumed it was just another boring economy car with a manual to teach a teenager the basics of driving.
2341,my first car was a shit box  so no trouble in selling that. my 2nd and 3rd cars were great  but driven into the ground and were financially not worth keeping. my current vehicle is 10 yrs old and will be buying new car next year  but this time i will buy electric and keep the ICE.
2342,My friends and I are not crunchy at all  and I'd love to run a game about them RPing as kids trick or treating in a neighborhood when real monsters are afoot. Might even throw in that they become for real whatever costume they're wearing.     I'm considering modding Ten Candles into Ten Candy Corns (with apologies to u/stephendewey)  but thought I'd ask people with more experience than I for any ideas on that that might not be obvious to me  a fairly new player and GM.     Thanks!
2343,My friends and I gave ourselves 10 weeks to make the best game we could  mostly to practice and get experience. Were currently halfway in  we have a working prototype and were expecting to have a final version in about 5 weeks.   Im wondering how do guys get visibility on your games? Were planning on releasing the game on Itch.io to gather feedback but we dont know how to attract players.   What is your personal experience on getting visibility / creating a community for your games? Should I start marketing now? Any tips?  Thank you.
2344,"My friends and I played pretty much every RPG we could get our hands on in high school.  D&D was the one we played the most  but classes  levels  and skyrocketing HP totals never really sat well with me.  After a decade of that  Shadowrun came out and I ended up running a year-long campaign in that from 1989-90.  In the years since then  I never really touched D&D or other class/level games again  aside from sitting in on friends' D&D campaigns for a session or two  but those were 3.x or 5e  which I *really* disliked.  And then  about 5 years ago  I ended up running a D&D retroclone system for a few months  and then a month-long ""one-shot"" last summer in Worlds Without Number when that came out.  It certainly felt comfortable  and I could easily improvise the mechanics without having to really think about it  since I had played so much D&D in the 80s  but I was still bothered by the same parts of the system as I had been back in the day  so I didn't stick with them and switched back to non-D&D systems before long."
2345,My girl : https://i.imgur.com/yTD0DTn.jpeg  Disclaimer  the Panamanian market is a bit different than the US market  things are a little bit more expensive here and lack many of the options  safety features and even engine choices than the American market. Also the global pandemic supply chain shortages influenced my purchasing decisions as I couldn't test drive some and some didn't even have inventory.   I've owned many vehicles  from Honda to BMW and currently a Mazda Cx-3 and I've never pictured myself in a Mitsubishi  after they canceled the Lancer I've felt that they lost their way  producing meh products  and throughout the years I've been swayed by more interesting offerings from other brands. But I'm at a point in my life where I want something simple but convenient. The Mazda Cx-3 was the world to me  excellent in every way except some hard plastics in the interior  poor rear space for passangers   and small boot hindered my need for  adventure. For pros it accelerates great  small dimensions make it an excellent city car and it looks nice.    But I needed something bigger for carrying my fiends  for taking my bike in adventures and for taking all my crap in the boot  I decided to change for something bigger. Then I looked at my budget and found that I could only afford base model compact crossovers. So I started the search. I shortlisted the obvious choices  Ford escape  Mazda Cx-5  Honda Crv  Subaru forester  Toyota Rav4. Save for the Ford as a wildcard  I wanted only Japanese brands.   It went like this :  * Ford escape : the exterior looked like the smaller of the lot  not the most attractive  peppy to drive with some interesting safety features that no one had at this price range such as emergency brake assist but lacked a spare tire or boot cover.   * Mazda cx-5 : was the most featured for the price  comfortable to drive and peppy but felt more of the same with the Mazda which is both a good thing and a bad one.   * Subaru forester : dealership in my country has the worst post sales dept  and for some reason was the most expensive.   * Honda crv : extremely basic (no android auto  no parking sensors  no push to start) from the price  this brand in this country is coasting on reputation alone.   * Toyota rav 4 : also full featured save for the lack of push to start. but they didn't have any inventory until next year (thanks covid supply chain disruptions)    I was leaning towards the cx-5 in the end until at my local mall I saw it.... a Mitsubishi Outlander in an exhibition  I went to glance at it on a whim because I love looking at cars and was very impressed  after seeing the very basic offerings from the competition this one felt like it ticks off all the marks on my wants :  * Android auto  * Roomy interior and boot (among the biggest in its class) * Full size spare tire * Awd (absolutely no one has awd at this price point  except for Subaru) and this for me was a major selling point.  I test drove it and made the purchase a wee
2346,My group has come to terms that if I'm running- I'm probably changing systems every campaign or two. Others are free to run if they want.  But my group are all long term players that are happy to just play- they don't particuarlly care and also know if a system isn't working- We'll drop it and I'll either find a new one or work to move it to one we know.
2347,My group just wrapped up a long-running game of Dungeon World  and I want a few short games before we dive into our next big thing. What games have you played that played well in 12 sessions and didnt take too long to get everyone familiar with the mechanics? The game doesnt have to specifically be a one shot only game if it runs well in short term play.  Weve done Honey Heist and Escape from Dino Island previously  and I have Goat Crashers and Lasers and Feelings in the queue.
2348,My guess is the wheels arent balanced correctly or the wheels arent bolted on all the way. But regardless the mechanic is at fault  and if they cant do either of those things right then I wouldnt go back to them. Bring it to another mechanic for diagnosis and have the first mechanic pay the bill.
2349,My guess is your engine is nearly shot doing this probably isnt going to kill it too much sooner. Seems like compression has to be an issue already. Its definitely not the same thing as an oil change but Im guessing you must have a TON of miles  or a VW to be burning that much oil!  now if youre LEAKING oil this is a very different story. Leaks are easier to fix generally and could be well worth it!
2350,My guy  look up the Kenny jams  the whole schtick is in addition to the theme you have to use certain assets (cus Kenny is an asset shop  but they have shit tons of free stuff as well)  https://www.kenney.nl/
2351,My hero academia has a bunny girl in it who shows up in later seasons. Her name is mirko  [problem children are coming from another world ](https://myanimelist.net/anime/15315/Mondaiji-tachi_ga_Isekai_kara_Kuru_Sou_Desu_yo) this show has a character like that
2352,My honest advise is  take some time off work/school tell you friends and family you are going away for a week  stock up on supply (jolt cola and  cheese puffs) and get stuck in  its a game that will easily drift your time away  theres always that just one more thing to do.
2353,My kid loves amazing tales. It's very simple and easy to run. Takes about half an hour including character creation.  I will be getting him starport for Christmas but only seen bits on YouTube so can't really comment on its suitability
2354,My list basically boils down to this after many years of on-and-off but admittedly minimal progress:  &#x200B;  Pro: I love learning and implementing the underlying technology that powers games. I was fascinated by the technology of games from a young age.  &#x200B;  Con: I found that except for a few rare superhumans  working on game technology and working on games themselves are separate  somewhat conflicting pursuits. The most efficient way to make a game is to reuse existing technology and focus on creating the actual gameplay and MAYBE assets (although even those can be purchased/outsourced). There's not really a great case for working on a custom game engine  other than getting a job working on a proprietary game engine. I have no interest in pursuing such a career path  so my game dev projects have basically been pared down to working on a custom engine that will probably never make me money  but I just do it for the love of learning how it works. I've mostly given up on the dream of actually making and releasing full games  which is not how I imagined it as a kid  but I'm okay with it because I like game engines that much more.
2355,My main gripe is the wheels are too small when all its competitors are running 19s or 20s. I get that this is essentially a very very updated early 2010's ATS so the engineers didn't have any choice. Yeah it probably performs fine and bigger wheels just add more weight  but from an aesthetic standpoint this is a minus for me.
2356,My main hope would be that they can couple it with something notably more powerful that a Core M. Or split the difference and offer a lower and higher spec unit with different classes of CPU  due to being modular.  I love my P2 Max as a light workload device  but I would really love the power of my Win 3 in a small form factor.  Heck even something like my Win Max with controller removed would be good.
2357,My mom bought the s2000 when I was a teen. I didnt know anything about it  and she just wanted a convertible. Our neighbour was a manager at the local Honda dealership so we got a deal on the s2000. She almost got sold on a NSX but it wasnt a convertible so she went with an S2K. She almost sold it a few times over the years but glad we kept it. Its now under my name  and I wont be selling it anytime soon.
2358,My new Jetta 6mt with the 1.4t can get over 50mpg if kept under 65mph. I wouldn't be surprised if the 1.5t can do the same at over 70 mph  Here's the car showing 49mpg at 68mph average. Trip was started on full tank and refuel showed 3.33 gallons to fill back to max so closer to 48mpg but still impressive  https://i.imgur.com/ocpJX0f.jpeg
2359,My niece has expressed Interest in RPGs  shes played some of my Home-brew systems with other kids  so shes had a little taste.  Id like to give her a book  so she can try it with her younger siblings  or play solo.  I see her family a few times a year.  But her interests are different from mine  so Im asking for help from the hive mind.  Shes not really interested in strange worlds  and weird creatures. I.e. not fantasy or scifI.  Though Aesop-like talking animals would probably be fine.  But I think a historical setting like American am Pioneers would fit her tastes better.  Shes not especially interested in combat. Im not saying there should be zero violence  but other routes should be at least as developed.  Solo RPGs recommendations are also welcome.  She already likes writing stories.  Thanks in advance.  &#x200B;  What do you recommend?
2360,My opinion on this is simple. Pause the game and talk to your players. There appears to be a disengagement of communication between the disinterested players and the GM. You should have this discussion with your players  not random people on the internet.  Find out what they would be interested in. It might be anything from a different system to a different module. It could be some of the players don't care if they are gaming as they are there just to hang out.  You will never know till you talk to your players.
2361,My Panamera 4S always starts out in 2nd. Only way a Panamera starts out in first is if it has the sport crono package and sport plus is enabled. Otherwise only way to start in first is if you manually select first.
2362,My problem with them is moreso that they're overpriced to hell and back for something that's been thrashed and loaded with shitty and poorly done mods. I actually tried to find a manual G35 sedan before I got my old Speed3  but they were all too much money for the condition they were in
2363,"My rsx has some high performance summer tires on it and when I launch a little too hard and start spinning the front wheels I get pretty bad wheel hop  so maybe it's something similar?  But it happens whether I have summer tires or winter tires   so the whole ""tires too good"" thing sounds like bullshit."
2364,My setup is pretty simple for drives. I have my c drive which is a Kingston ssd which I keep windows on. Works like a charm. Everything else I have my on my E drive which is a 2TB HDD and my computer wont start now unless I only keep my ssd plugged in
2365,My specific example of an F-Type R.  Beautiful  made all the right noises  wonderful steering (hydraulic)  and really was an experience to drive.    I owned it for 8 months  it was in my possession running properly for 12 days during that time; 10 of those 12 days I experienced leaks on the garage floor (coolant and oil).  &#x200B;  ... with that said  my wife's F-Pace has been a great car and I would buy another one in a heartbeat; I'm ready to be hurt again.
2366,"My success in developing a team has been...... awkward. It's not really a team because it's commissions but at the same time I have a server for general stuff. I've recruited multiple people  right now it's at 6/7 but really only 2 I have no issues with their work. One of them has a hard time following through/finishing  the other failed quality a few times  and the next hasn't responded. I pay everyone (even start commissions) but almost feel ripped off at times  we're talking like $100 USD or more.  Perhaps the issue is I'm doing an ""asset first"" approach instead of mechanics/programming first. This probably reduces moral because it doesn't feel like the project is going anywhere because the glue (programming) hasn't connected anything yet. Even then..... because it's commission  I don't think it's reason to not finish the work  can't program if I'm doing graphics  can't make music if I'm doing programming. It's a lose-lose situation.  Edit: This seemed to turn out to be more of a rant than anything productive. Don't mind me."
2367,My three groups are friends-of-friends and their family.  The fourth group using our game server is as well.     Not a ton of timezone variance in that  but Eastern  Central  and Mountain time United States.
2368,My Time At Portia.  Sort of a Animal Crossing life sim but with combat and RPG elements. But super cute  with lots of charm including far more detailed character relationships than any similar game I've played. Closer to something like Satisfactory than Harvest Moon. All about scaling up and running multiple productions lines at once.
2369,My viper was always my dream car and Ive wanted one forever but theyre dated with regards to safety so now that I can afford a nice sports-car  Ive decided to get a C8 Corvette in the next year.   I wish dodge would restart the Viper line
2370,My wife and I have played every Borderlands game to date  starting on 360 with the original up through 3 and found enjoyment in every one of them (even The Pre Sequel). We were genuinely moved with parts of the Telltale game  and that's when it dawned on us that we're kind of big fans of the series and have grown attached over the years. I hope we get a BL3 Ultimate physical edition soon to add to our little collection.  We are avidly awaiting Tiny Tina's Wonderlands  as that DLC in BL2 was a lot of fun and memorable.
2371,My wife bought a Mazda CX-30 turbo recently. The acceleration/torque that rivals entry level sports sedans  AWD  ground clearance  and overall look/feel sold it for her.   The fact that the new Civic is barely available to even look at  has a CVT (blah)  feels far slower  and is pretty close price wise just sealed the deal.
2372,My wife has an Outlander GT with the V6 AWD (no CVT) and leather heated seats. We got it before the used market went crazy last year. It's a fantastic car with plenty of power and it can launch off the line faster than most expect it can. I've owned a Mitsubishi galant for 17 years and it's rock solid reliable. So far the Outlander is problem free as well and is very comfortable to drive. We were also led to it for it's unusually large cargo space. We routinely will have our two big dogs in the back and our daughter in the back seat. I agree about the excellent sound system. I also own a Veloster N and I don't feel like I'm sacrificing much except a significant downgrade in handling when I drive the outlander. Both cars are pretty rare at this point and it's difficult for me to understand as they are both terrific bargains with outstanding warranties tarnished by brand reputation. More savings for us I guess.
2373,My wireless mouse has randomly stopped working. It's not the batteries or the USB port  and I've tried two wireless mouses so far. The second one worked absolutely fine yesterday and only today has it stopped working. I have no idea what to do  anything I see online doesn't work. Please help.
2374,My writeup. I've recorded each session  run a speech to text and done a writeup of every session  it's at about 92 000 words and counts as a novel (a really bad one). mostly made up of direct quotes from the players.   It's a nice thing to look back on and allows me to reach back to throw away comments in session 4 and recast them to look like epic foreshadowing
2375,My younger brother just had his PC shipped back home by the us military. However  upon arrival some parts of the interior (notably some screws on the case fans) were covered in rust. Unfortunately  my younger brother didn't notice the damage until after he tried to turn it on--in which the pc turned on for a moment and then immediately turned back off. Now it won't turn on at all. How extensive would you guys say the damage is? Obviously some parts must have still been wet or already damaged when he turned it on  but I'm worried the whole thing might be fried. I know it's basically impossible to guess without taking a look at the thing  but a general idea of what parts could be damaged would help ease my mind a bit. This was a custom pc.  For those wondering  he did have shipping protection on his stuff so he'll eventually be reimbursed for whatever the damage comes out to be. Still pretty upset about the egregious neglect it went through in shipping though :/
2376,Naah  the most learning for CS is by yourself. Even if you take classes you will need to learn everything by yourself. The thing schools offer is structure but you can learn gaps in knowledge by following one of the many learning flow-charts people have online.                      Maybe you will miss out on some algorithms but you will likely never be building linked lists from scratch or custom sorting algorithms outside of leetcode tests. Even if you do learning what you need is only a short tutorial video away. People place too much stock in school.
2377,naive question incoming: i currently have a thunderbolt device connected through a usb-c adapter to an intel board.  as i understand it  thunderbolt was supposed to be rolled into usb with the new standard this year?  does a usb motherboard need to explicitly state it does thunderbolt now? trying to put together a cheap amd build and have no idea if that's still an issue when shopping.
2378,NB Miatas have a little plastic slot on the B pillar of the passenger side that you can clip the seatbelt buckle into. This prevents it from wearing the seat bolster and clanking around the interior when youre tearing up the local backroads without a passenger.   I wish it was more common  or that there was some sort of aftermarket solution for it.
2379,ND MX5. I'm constantly surprised it's a 7 year old design. Mazda did a great job on its design.  I also think the F10 5 Series will go down in history well. It reminds me of the E39 in terms of how timeless it looks.
2380,Nearly every Web Dev skill is transferrable to Game Dev. The problem is that those skills are only a small subset of what's done in Game Dev.   It seems difficult to you because you're doing it alone and have to consider all sorts of things that you haven't had to before.   However what if you were to exclusively work on Database Transactions  UI/UX  Code Profiling  Q&A  Web Protocols  etc. while you had partners working on the other parts?   It wouldn't seem as daunting would it?
2381,Necromancer is my bag  baby.   Every zone is a bone-zone when I start raising the dead. The added creep factor of my legion of spooky-scary skeletons makes up for any lack of subtlety.   As a hybrid class  I'd mix Necromancer with Beast-master. A zombie Kodiak with wrought-iron fangs  draped in hundreds of undead rodents ready to swarm at my command.
2382,Need to see more of Kazama and Sakurai already.   And while i'm writing this  i only now realize that Kazama's phone call was maybe to get her away from the other's guy advances.   I'm very much not onboard with the MC's as potential ship but i do like their dynamic together.
2383,Never thought I'd cry over Fido again  but he's really back!  And Eugen just couldn't stop raising those deathflags...  It's eery that Shin is getting back into his reaper role  completly with destroying his allies brains and hearing the Legion  The fighting was awesome  I you thought the 86 where great before  just watch them with proper support this time  unfortunatly not enough to turn the war around...  Oh yeah and Frederica continues a cute cinnamon role and is officially a mascot now (but that tradition is fucked up)
2384,New = if the anime is a sequel or leftover  character wasn't in a previous season  My top 10 as of right now are:  1. Draluc (The Vampire Dies in No Time) 2. Amou Shiiba (AMAIM) 3. William Maryblood (Faraway Paladin) 4. Ronaldo (The Vampire Dies in No Time) 5. Yuka Ayukawa (Blue Period) 6. Yatora Yaguchi (Blue Period) 7. Gagumber (Sakugan) 8. Eve Louise (Visual Prison) 9. Bojji (Ranking of Kings) 10. Biwa (Heike Monogatari)  Interestingly  my list has little to do with which anime I'm enjoying most. The Vampire Dies in No Time is pretty hit-or-miss and I didn't really enjoy ep 2 at all  but I love the main 2 characters.  What characters do you like this season?
2385,New iPhone  same old salty  snide  and hateful comments.  You can be pro-repair while also having some humility and being level-headed about the problem at hand. Wishing for the death of Apples employees  and berating its customers as stupid  is not going to convince anyone to take you seriously.   Furthermore  its also worth remembering that most OEMs are going the route of anti-repair; which manifests in many different ways (e.g.  parts simply not being available). Constantly bashing Apple while being a loyalist to another OEM adopting anti-repair tactics  again  prevents you from being taken seriously.
2386,New mustangs  new Porsches  the current Challenger  C7 Corvette  ND Miata  MK7 GTI  current gen Accord  Ford Maverick  new BRZ/86  and the current generation F150 are all gonna age insanely well.   I think many new electric cars will not age well. The Hyundai ioniq 5 is a cyberpunk abomination and will probably be way too radical looking once EVs become the norm.
2387,New OP for new continent  I guess?  And I thought the whole episode's gonna be spent on naked Rudeus stuck in his cell in the beast race village. (Turns out Rudi could have easily escaped if he wanted to all this time  but chose to wait it out and resolve the misunderstanding before Gisu came along. )  Thankfully  they jumped straight into the action with the slavers' attack on the village  with Rudeus and Gisu (what a bro) stopping them. And that's where the animation goes into crazy mode.  I think Rudi has used other magic besides water  but this is probably the first time he's used magic to kill someone.  RIP Eris' grandpa  falling victim to ruthless political machinations Game of Thrones-style. No doubt there will be people who want to use the magic disaster as a pretext to grab power  much like how people in the past would use natural disasters as an excuse to blame those in power for losing the grace of God and overthrow them.
2388,"Next year's headline - paizo declares bankruptcy.  We saw very clearly when the whole story of the ""Harassment at Paizocon"" came out  filling in the blanks certain rpg sites left out  that Paizo has problems with bad actors.  They need the ability to fire them  and as we all know with Unions  they just lost that.  Their products are going to go downhill fast now that Paizo can't handle problem employees."
2389,Nice that there's a manual. Anyone got an idea which engine (@0:14) is that exhaust note from? Is it the Si or the CTR motor?  There's a lot of disappointment brewing in the [spy shot post](https://www.reddit.com/r/cars/comments/q7r2bc/spied_2023_acura_integra_drops_heavy_suit/). Now that it'll be unveiled soon  I think it's safe to say that most are hoping (with pessimism) that Acura can get this right  On the topic of transmissions  most are probably wondering what auto the base engine would get since the new Si was confirmed to be manual-only. If the base is the 1.5 turbo  my bet is that the ILX's 8-speed DCT might return  like the [Chinese-market CDX](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acura_CDX) that paired them together
2390,Nioh 2  maybe? Or is it too action-y? It has great customization options and [pretty big skill trees](https://www.destructoid.com/ul/583252-nioh-2-tip-use-onmyo-and-ninjutsu-abilities-to-get-skill-points/Nioh-2-Sloth-Talisman-Onmyo-Magic-Skill-Tree-noscale.jpg).
2391,Nissan 370Z the shape and lines of that car are just timeless. Yes its been over do for a refresh  but my god does it still look good. Not to mention the brand new 400z is utilizing the exact same shape and unibody as well as suspension of the 370z.
2392,No  but it is VERY boring/tedious. Its essentially doing the same thing over and over and over again for... no reason. Wouldn't recommend it unless you're hardcore into JRPGs  because the story isn't good enough to carry the completely tedious game overall.
2393,No  I've settled on 3 systems for 3 different type of settings (fantasy  cyberpunk and space opera) as GM and I'm not really interested in learning another system to GM mostly because I don't have the time to do it anymore. I know those systems and I have the books. If my players want to play a different system  they can be the GM for once.
2394,No clue if it got a lot of loot  but Horizon Zero Dawn got a 60 fps patch recently.  Also not a RPG  but Monster Hunter World runs at 60 fps + 4k and consists of nothing else but loot  I second Tales of Arise - not a huge ton of loot  but an amazing experience on PS5.
2395,No homo  but Will's design looks really pretty lmao  especially with the ponytail.        Really good episode! Time's passing by pretty fast  Will is not 13 years old. As much as I like the 3 undead parents  it's pretty exciting to think what happens once Will starts his adventure. Gus definitely sus  but I don't think he's hiding anything evil? The gambling scene was pretty funny  Mary is great.         That spear is pretty sick  if that's gonna be Will's weapon then I am down. The pacing so far seems a little fast  but it's not bad  it's good enough. It would have been nice to slow down a little. Really curious what Gus is hiding though  looking forward to the next episode.
2396,"No idea why I enjoying this  cause by all accounts this seems like really typical ""card game anime where card game is so important it's deciding fate of the universe""  MC is edgelord  new introduced character Hiyori is annoying (especially her voice  which isn't because her seiyuu is bad  she's actually quite great and voiced lots of characters I like  just here she's too shrill)  Banka isn't too interesting either and duels are far from the most interesting out there  and yet there is something to it. Maybe it's all designs  while visuals and animation quality are pretty average  I dig the designs and its edginess makes me smile. And at least so far tactics in the show aren't all ""I'm playing strong high level monster  I'm so tactical""."
2397,No More Robots is 4 years old  so it's time for a thread of *LOVELY NUMBERS*:  - $12m in revenue during last 12 months - More than 800 000 units sold - More than 4 million people played our games - Split pretty dang evenly across PC + all console platforms  Look at this graph   ***  posted by [@RaveofRavendale](https://twitter.com/RaveofRavendale)  Photos in tweet |  [Photo 1](http://pbs.twimg.com/media/E8rejAsWUAc-rwd.jpg)   ^[(Github)](https://github.com/username) ^| ^[(What'snew)](https://github.com/username)
2398,No one has expressed their annoyance (though I'm sure they are sometimes) but I regularly change systems/settings  but despite also currently running a lvl 1 - 20 DnD campaign. I've been able to balance the two by running my ongoing campaign for 12-ish sessions (or until there's a natural pausing point) then switching to another game for no more than 6 sessions  then coming right back. As far as I can tell  everyone seems real happy with the arrangement.
2399,"No one is the ""rpg guy""  peoples tastes are far more varied than that. It's like saying I'm the ""bread guy""  sure bread is nice  and there are a lot of different types of bread  but if I eat nothing but bread I'm gonna get sick of it. Play some other stuff  enjoy some mobas or roguelikes or shooters. Just don't ever forget the golden rule of gaming.   If you're not having fun  stop playing."
2400,No one really considers the Honda accord euro which came with a k20a engine stock (in ausdm and nzdm that is). I tried searching some builds up but I couldn't find anything interesting. Is there a reason for this or is it genuinely just slept on?
2401,No one's mentioned Elder Scrolls yet. Skyrim can be played on both Xbox and Switch and Oblivion/Morrowind can be played on Xbox....hell Morrowind can be played on your Android phone if you want something to play on the shitter.
2402,No post beeps so guessing the motherboard doesn't have a built-in speaker. Ideally you want to get a Mobo speaker and plug it in to see what beep code your getting.  What is the make and model of the Mobo?
2403,no spoilers but imo dalish elf origin is the one that yields the best overall narrative  witch hunt is the last dlc you're supposed to play (has the highest level enemies) and there are certain plot threads introduced only in the dalish elf origin which are then brought a full circle in witch hunt  someone else mentioned that you should play mage  and while i fully agree with them - that mages play a more important role overall in dragon age universe  you can't play as a mage if you wanna pick dalish elf origin - which imo is a worth-it tradeoff
2404,No such thing as too much grip preventing you from putting power down. If anything the more grip you have the better your power goes down. We put 200 tw tires  r comps  and slicks on everything from super cars to miatas.
2405,"No tips  but I do have a GM voice apparently.  I was a player in a game and the two other players were discussing what we should do and kept going around in circles.  The GM was just sitting there listening. I was getting bored and suddenly I heard myself say ""That is enough  move along...""  One of the other players said  ""That is his GM voice  we better move along."""
2406,No way this lasted 25 minutes. I felt like I was watching 3 episodes in 1 with how the story flowed so well.  Eugene's death was just brutal and out of the blue. Like a real war  things move quickly with no warning. Really enjoy seeing Giad's military training and R&D scenes. Shows how much more competent they are compared to San Magnolia.
2407,"No.  Actually you are probably seeing their social side. Try asking them about board games  miniatures painting  modeling  or computers. It probably is that ""D&D"" is attractive to new players and dispels the myths regarding ""satanic panic""  after all roleplaying is still a fairly novel pastime compared to youths with motorised scooters. They probably are just trying to put their best foot forward is all.  Ask them what kind of Star Wars / Star Trek they like. You'll find science fiction RPGs are just as common  same with superhero  horror  vampire  etc.  But  they are probably just as apprehensive about roleplaying with others as you.  Join an online group  there are plenty during Covid  and attend conventions  everyone at a convention games  you just need an introduction.  Hope that helps  D&D is a niche  but  compared to any other RPG it is the "" coca cola"" of brand names.  Tyvm"
2408,No. I liked Kingdom Hearts 1 because it was exactly what I wanted in a Disney / Final Fantasy crossover. We have Disney branded adventures in Disney themed worlds and that's it. When it started adding convoluted backstory in the sequels  it lost me. Kingdom Hearts 1 and 2 were fine. KH2 was written with the idea that no one played Chain of Memories and took the time to fill the players in on the relevant back story elements of it. Everything else assumes that you were rich enough to own all the various consoles that they were on and played them.
2409,No. In fact  they don't need to log into a computer at all to know if the hardware is working properly.  Of course  they won't be able to check if the OS detects the hardware changes. But a fan is a simple repair  compared to say  replacing a cpu or installing  some other device.
2410,No. Look at Dragonball. Americanising Japanese made media never works out well.   I'd like them to make another film like Advent Children though. That was a fun ride. Also  Kingsglaive was arguably better than FFXV.
2411,"No. The Kingdom Management is how I roleplay the kind of Kingdom my PC would rule. Is it ideal? No. But it's an acceptable abstraction.     And historical note  most feudal Kings (or even Dukes) did not stay at their capital all the time and rule from a central bureaucracy. Their court traveled. And they would spend months  even years sometimes  in parts of the country far removed from the ancestral seat of power. Why? Well  in part  to deal with significant issues in areas needing attention more effectively. So in that regard  Rulers Who Did Things is a more accurate trope than the standard fantasy  ""King at his Ivory Throne.""   And that's established kingdoms with decades or even centuries of history. How much more a fledgling realm expanding rapidly in a land that knows absolutely nothing but anarchy and banditry? Facing threats that no  not every sword-swinger or peasant can deal with. And even if they could  the danger of not dealing with such threats would undermine the Ruler's credibility  and the realm's stability as a result.      As any Crusader Kings player can tell you  bureaucracies were smaller and standing armies MUCH smaller than we know today in the Medieval era. The Feudal Contract was built on the idea that smaller nobles would pay taxes and give service to a liege who could protect them. And the liege would protect them at need and honor their service. To NOT attend to these issues  in a real sense  would be a betrayal of the feudal contract."
2412,No. Used motor oil carries dirt and tiny metal particulates which harm your engine. Flushing those out with a complete oil change is what preserves the engine. Topping off old oil with new immediately contaminates the new oil rendering it useless.
2413,"None  since I separate the art from the artist. A famous example that had big real-world consequences is the toxic portrayal of sharks in the movie Jaws  which have caused tons of unnecessary hunting. Despite this portrayal making sharks out to be ""evil killer animals""  I don't think Steven Spielberg is a bad person for creating it.  Even propaganda anime from the war  doesn't necessarily make the artists bad people  as many are simply interesting in chasing the craft of animation  which didn't really have a real platform back then  so they decided to chase their passion despite the content of these stories (not saying that none of the pe. Even if a sensitive theme is handled badly  it doesn't make the artist a bad person  but it can certainly make them a bad writer when it comes to handling sensitive topics. Even today  there is some writers that deliberately put certain sketchy topics in their works  to make said work sell better.  Similarly there are lots of authors out there that are bad people (despite their works not ""hinting"" at it in any way)  but I don't think this affects the quality of a work either (or makes their work offensive in any way)  especially when so many other animators and staff members have worked on the same anime (example: Rurouni Kenshin). I find that similar to if ""Alexandre Gustave Eiffel"" had a horrible past that was discovered  this wouldn't mean the Eiffel Tower (or the Statue of Liberty which he also worked on) suddenly become less impressive structure or ""offensive""  just because his company designed it."
2414,"None of the ""deep learning"" systems are deep  and none of them involve learning.  It's repetitive tuning  at best.  You end up with a black box system that might be good at categorizing data similar to data you fed it and manually trained it on.  You don't know why it works when it works or why it doesn't when it doesn't  and you have no confidence on its ability to deal with new input.  You're basically just brute forcing a problem and attempting to mimic a human's output  with no insight as to the human's actual thinking or what meaning the may be in the input data.  Back in the day  we called them ""expert systems"".  Not a great name  but still better than ""deep learning"".  Such systems are still useful  just not generally so."
2415,None of them are turn based combat. They are all real-time with pause. Icewind Dale is mostly combat with a little story. Torment is mostly story with a little combat. BG is a mix. All great games. I love BG personally the most and I think it is a great start. If you just want a story get Torment. You cant go wrong with any of them but from your interests I would say get Torment.
2416,"Nope  this is normal in the western hemisphere  Due to the ""Satanic Panic"" of the 80s  media like stranger things  online big names like critical role  D&D is basically the most famous RPG on the market  Pair that with the fact that 5th edition has been around for the better part of a decade  and that it's an extremely welcoming system for new players  it's understandable why it's the big one  That aside  D&D also a bit more welcoming in terms of theme & genre. ""Heroism"" is a pretty universal  easy to swallow moral. And everyone can comprehend high fantasy as a concept  because it's effectively ripped straight out of most of our fairytales.   Unlike  say Vampire  where you're trying to grapple with your hold on ""what it means to be human"" and how to deal with being a monster. Or Call of Cthulhu which deals with the mind boggling entities of cosmic horror.   That aside  AGAIN  D&D is an RPG in the classic sense. Tactical combat  turned combat  resource management  and exploration are the majority of mechanics. One need not be a roleplayer to play and fully enjoy this game.   - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -   Tldr: D&D is   - Famous  - Easy to play  - Easy to understand  And  - Inclusive of many types of players   As a result  it's fanbase has very much oversaturated the rpg market  But  ""oversaturated"" doesn't mean it's the only groups. In fact  D&D has brought a lot of new life into the table gaming sphere in general.   So keep looking! Eventually you will be able to find a group. That's a promise! Reddit & discord are great resources.   Any system you're looking into in particular?"
2417,Nope. Anything that I'm exceptionally good at I've taught myself. When I was very young I taught myself drums from a book  guitar from a book  piano from a book  violin from VHS/DVDs  banjo from just listening to banjo players and emulating through watching  music production through books and experimenting and other producers and as of 2 years ago been teaching myself coding and calculus.   Anything that anyone's tried to teach me was way too structured for me to experiment   discover and grow. I did poorly in math in school  but now doing very well teaching myself through text books I can only imagine it'd be the same with coding. Worrying about what the test would accept as a definition as opposed to actually understanding the definition and experimenting. As they say  if you want o get laid go to college  if you want an education go to the library. But that's me  your milage may vary
2418,Nope. I have the stuff Im diehard about (mostly JDM Toyotas and nissans  some BMW) and then everything else  which Im not diehard about but which I still like.  Its either great or good for me if its in the automotive world.
2419,Nostalgia. In the 80s and 90s most regular fwd cars handled like shit. The fwd coupes handled slightly better and had slightly better power while still being cheap. Their purpose was cheap  fun car.  Now  pretty much everything needs to be 'sporty.' Every car has decent power and decent handling. So there is no room in the market for a regular car with slightly better handling / looks. Hence the FWD coupe is dead.  Bringing back the FWD coupe won't make it 1995 again  there is no point.
2420,Not a fan of this latest trend to put everything behind cladding  especially the back i/o panel where it interferes with the clearance for the CPU cooler. Is there really a benefit  apart from the VRMs?
2421,Not a lot of identical games to New Vegas  but if youre looking for exploration  heres a few titles that I assume are on console:  Theres your obvious titles; Fallout 3  4  and 76  and the Elder Scrolls games. Elder Scrolls Online; its an MMO  but you can explore and play by yourself for free  except for paying to play online on console.  Kingdom Come: Deliverance  Not as much of an RPG  but Metro Exodus. Chernobylite might be another contender and actually has RPG mechanics. The Stalker franchise  but thats for PC.  The Outer Worlds might hit that wicket  too.  Kingdoms of Amalur has some pretty good environments to take it  but is fairly linear.  Biomutant. Some people dont care for it  but I really enjoyed the exploration and loot.
2422,Not a part but I was actually very shocked at the limited info out there on changing the taillight on my sister's Elantra hatchback. All videos and articles were for the sedan and it was much more involved than the hatchback. Ended up using a video of a different make and model as a guide. I'm very new to working on cars so I haven't really had to order parts myself that were hard to find...yet.
2423,Not a problem I've noticed. Im mid-50s  not a fan of the current iteration of the worlds most popular role-playing game and have not had much trouble finding players. Im playing or running with four different groups right now. In three of them  Im noticeably older than the other players  and the in the fourth Im right in the middle of the age spread.  in general  I find that the whole question of age never really comes up  nor does my preference for playing other games - although some of the games I play are relatively new (just not new D&D).
2424,Not a tech  but I'm in parts. We love warranty work. Because it means we make more money than non warranty work. Any time a job comes in for warranty  it means more parts get billed out  because it's required or the manufacturer won't cover the claim. There's a given amount of hours for each job  and techs who can finish in less time make more hours because if a job pays 5 hours and they do it in 3  they can move on to another job. So if they do two jobs  one warranty that pays 5 hours and another job that they get paid say 3 hours for. They get 8 hours of pay for 6 hours of work.
2425,Not an RPG  but Civilization games once you learn all the mechanics.  I've wasted far too much time playing Civ V while listening to music or watching TV shows because I just go through the motions.  Something I've been trying to ween myself off of.  Same goes for exploring deep space in Elite Dangerous.  For RPGs  I'd say games with low story and high leveling.  Like Final Fantasy III and V or Dragon Quest III and IX.  For most RPGs though  I don't do this.  Because the major appeal to me is NPC interaction and music.  If the game isn't keeping my attention enough that I need to turn on other music/videos  it's kind of a sign I need to play some other RPG.
2426,Not an RPG  generally. MMOs are usually the sort of game you can play while zoning out. Can also go old-school with games like Diablo I/II  even III (blech)  or the spiritual successors in the Torchlight series  but they do still require attention on higher difficulties  or during boss encounters  that sorta thing.
2427,Not at all. Firstly it's not a complete kingdom but a barony with almost nothing of value. Secondary it's a prize with a catch because barony is located in a very strategically disadvantageous place with greedy Pitax as a neighbor  swamps  trolls  barbarian invasions. It's like giving away a house near active volcano.
2428,Not bad. Definitely a sizable bump in screen. It's bigger  more lights  and adjustable warmth. The latter two is definitely noticable on my Oasis. I specifically went with the Oasis over some non Kindle options because of how many LEDs it has. The lighting is extremely even on the device and I am excited to see it make it down to the lower models. Warm light adjustment is also a much needed addition.   I am not sure how much the signature addition is worth though. The adjustable light senor on my Oasis is just okay  I don't really use it though. And while wireless charging is nice  I am not sure those two features is a $60 upgrade.  I am really interested to see what they do with the Oasis now though as they brought several of it's features down.
2429,Not defending this or anything  but couldn't you just create a private room and play solo that way if you wanted to?  My friends and I played the beta with it set to private and had a bot for our 4th slot every time.  Unless they removed bots in co-op  or removed the ability to create a private game completely  this shouldn't be a big deal.  It's still stupid  but shouldn't impact anyone that knows how to avoid it.  Plus  who wants to play this game solo anyway?
2430,Not everyone wants to be that person who's giving everyone rides  so for their situation they just want a sporty coupe to get from A to B. If they're just daily driving and not doing any stunts  what's really the point of RWD? If you got a FWD with some power  torque steer off a traffic light can be incredibly fun. Winter driving feels safer and trunk space with rear seats folded down is plenty. The differences between FWD and RWD are highly exaggerated for cars that are purely street driven.   Now to play devil's advocate  I think price is the biggest reason for FWD coupes or else I don't see why you can't replace it with AWD. I only got my car because it was the best 6-cylindar manual for the money (really didn't care what car it was). It speaks for itself with FWD coupes being dead for sometime now but there are some positives to a FWD coupe.
2431,Not gonna lie; any one who truly  without a doubt in their logical mind  can honestly convince themselves that the sound mixing to create these two specific sounds to happen together is random is an absolute moron. I envy that ignorance I sometimes wish I could have.
2432,Not in general  no.  Assuming you keep the wheel diameter the same  you can increase or decrease your rim size  as long as it still fits on your car.  If you increase your rim size so far  that you increase your total wheel diameter  you do in fact need to get your car re-calibrated  to show the right speed  and the right distance driven.  Depending on make and model you might have a certain margin that is considered acceptable  due to different stock wheel sizes  as well as tire wear.  And just to make it clear  as it reads like you did confuse something there:  Rim size + tire size = wheel size  e.g.  165/60R14 and 155/70R13 have only a 1.2% speed difference.  165/16R14 and 155770R14 (!) have a 3.3% speed difference.   This might even be within margin  but might be enough to warrant a re-calibration.
2433,Not me but my father owned at one point or another most of the cool classic cars you could have. He had a bronco  blazer  68 camaro 69 charger  a couple mustangs probably 66-73? 240zs  69 510  67 gto. Probably others that I cant recall. He always told me he was embarrassed to drive a mustang when he went to university because it looked a little beat up.
2434,Not me but my grandfather had a 57 Chevy 4 Door Hard top that he bought in 59 drove it until 65 and sold it. He still regrets selling it and has looked at buying one but they are one of the more rare models since most people got coupe or regular 4 doors so they command a premium. Also have a family friend that had some shit SAAB in college with some race package (honestly dont remember what year or model it was) but he has now spent 30 years trying to find another like it because his died and he got rid of it since he was a broke college student turns out that the version he had only 4k were make with less than 1k ever coming to the US they are not super valuable but they are just impossible to find.
2435,Not me but my uncle. He bought 2 new BMW Z8s like 20 years ago. One was an on the lot unit that hadn't sold  and one he ordered due to a color spec.   Both have very crazy low usage (under 3k km) but are started regularly and really taken care of.   Hes back in London so idk what he paid in GBP  but assuming the car marketing back home is comparable to the US  they are probably double the value of their original SRP.  Hes got some other cool/rare cars but idk the values on them in relation to their original selling prices. Notable second place (I'm assuming its appreciated) is a Lotus 340r. That's my fav car he owns.
2436,Not necessarily shows that are bad or dont have an ending  but where the conclusion of the initial arc (or even just first couple of episodes) is so satisfying/of such higher quality that youd be better off with it ending things there. Some of the ones I thought of dont have an actual conclusion in these episodes but just have such a drastic cut off in quality in later episodes.   Higehiro   OreSuki  Pet Girl of Sakurasou   Masamune-kuns Revenge  OsaMake (Childhood Friend Wont Lose)  Kokoro Connect (yes I know everyone digs the later romance routes)  Bunny Girl Senpai  Nisekoi Season 2 (after Chitoge mom arc)
2437,Not one mention of the Veloster N despite it being much more similar than the cars he compared the GR Yaris to. Didn't even include it on the dougscore. He compared it to a Mustang rather than a similarly souped up bad economy hatchback that is a high strung weird car from an untraditional brand for performance. Veloster N secretly did something horrible to Doug.
2438,Not particularly good cars I love the looks of:  2nd generation Mazda Mx-6   Suzuki Kizashi   90s Land Rover Discovery  ~1993 Nissan Maxima  1st gen Acura TSX (these are actually pretty good)  And most embarrassingly1st gen Toyota solara.
2439,Not quite as rare as some  but my low mileage 96 bronco is a survivor and pretty rare as far as nice obs fords go. Its my daily :) no mods though  as I like to just enjoy its factory form. Life is too short to drive boring cars. Gonna be worth less and less as I add miles but Ill take the years of smiles over a few extra bucks as it rots in a garage somewhere
2440,"Not really  though part of me always wants to!  When anyone starts a game in our group we say how long it'll last. Two sessions? Six months? It's a really different mindset in the two situations. I think a lot of people are perfectly happy to try something if it's pitched as trying it. Also  use pregens in that case.  If that's all you do it leaves the ""campaign"" itch unscratched  but if you're the only one willing to GM then there's room for someone else to step up if they want."
2441,Not really a collector car  but I had a Saab 9-5 Aero wagon. They are pretty rare though. I got a more modern car and was driving it daily and I let the Saab sit for almost 2 months because I lost the key. Long story short the calipers seized and I rear ended someone who came to an abrupt stop. So I say you have to drive it  preferably once a week.
2442,"Not really a question  but I often have to deal with people saying ""Keep watching  it gets better."" Harmless statement  but usually people that say this don't really take into consideration that they probably enjoyed the show up until the ""gets good"" areas and a person pausing or dropping the show didn't enjoy it enough to continue."
2443,"Not really an Evil Hat Fan (not a story game fan  and I'll never trust anything involving a fedora)  but I do hope this success will put to rest the persistent whinging about a lack of market viability for queer or ""woke"" RPG product."
2444,Not so much a feature as an entire drivetrain technology:  Diesel/electric hybrids. Like freight trains. Electric traction motor(s) at the wheels  big battery in the middle  and a little ~1.0L ~80hp diesel engine that constantly runs at a consistent RPM/load to keep the batteries topped off as much as possible/range extender. A little diesel engine running in such a way could hit 500 000 miles no problem and burn less fuel than a motorcycle. I realize this would add a few hundred pounds to the car's curb weight  but if a car had this technology  it probably wouldn't need as big of a battery so I'd bet you could compensate for that added weight with a smaller  lighter battery (Model 3 battery is just over a THOUSAND pounds).
2445,Not so much an accident as it was that it just happened to be the last era of true SL(if you want to call anything after the gullwing a true SL) . It was driven (not my car specifically but the model) by some pretty influential people in period both of which died in period( Princess Diana   and Tupac) . Luckily it has been pretty overlooked for some time and really affordable  however that's sure to change   just like the pagoda did.
2446,Not sure how well the game runs on PS5  but Cyberpunk 2077 sounds right up your alley.  It plays pretty similarly to a Bethesda title  with a lot of loot to be gathered and used.  It runs at 60 fps on PS5 and I'd have to imagine the patches have improved stability.  But I only played the PC version of it so can't say for certain.
2447,"Not sure how you came to this conclusion  if I'm honest.  Ultimately  ""roleplaying"" is entirely subjective and abstract and isn't a trait that can be used to describe a genre. It's no different than ""immersion"" or ""fun"". To figure out what RPGs really are as video games  yes  you really do need to be looking at the shared features of these game's core gameplay loops. Game design is what defines genres of games.  If I were to take a stab at it  games where the **primary goal** of the player is designed to be progression (leveling  getting stronger  and similar mechanics) are what I've found to be the most common trait of all RPGs (Western and Japanese).  And as others have said  genres aren't so black and white  either. There will be grey areas and games that could be argued either way (Yakuza games  certain Zelda games  many modern WRPGs  etc.). That's just the nature of genres  which are often applied in hindsight and are somewhat arbitrarily defined groupings based on trends. You don't get very strict definitions that way.  Note also that tabletop games very well might differ from what RPGs ended up being in video games - a separate medium. This can muddy the water for some."
2448,Not sure if anyone has mentioned it already but I always jump on the chance to recommend Outward to anyone who wants an RPG to play. It's fantastic  clunky at first but after get used to it it's a gem. It can feel unpolished at times (small development team) but it just has a charm I haven't gotten anywhere else.
2449,Not sure if folks around here have come across Missa Reviews  but it's a new YouTube channel where the host tries to shed light on lesser known RPG supplements and games to give smaller creators a bit of spotlight they have a hard time getting otherwise. Her latest (and second) video cover [100 Witches and 100 Dangerous Plants](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XAQlewzoT34&t=1s) by Alice Liddell  and since I think they're solid additions to any fantasy game I figured I'd share the review in hopes other folks would check them out.
2450,"Not sure of the year of your s2k  but added this to my 06 and its been great.   Crux BTS-HN2 Bluetooth Music Streaming for Select Honda Vehicles  5"" X 1.5"" X 8.25"" https://smile.amazon.com/dp/B01JODG4EE/ref=cm_sw_r_cp_api_glt_fabc_7BHQHME33TMR9447681Z?_encoding=UTF8&psc=1"
2451,Not sure what you mean about there being no worldbuilding or character development. Because there is a lot of it.  But without spoiling anything  the current season is giving focus on the Villain group  including giving origin information and setting up the big issue of All For One's successor.
2452,Not sure whether it has been asked already  but what engine are you trying to develop with (assuming you aren't trying to build a game from the ground up)?  I personally began learning game development with GMS2  but I probably would have been much better off if I knew how accessible Unity is before I jumped into it. Not that I dislike GameMaker specifically  but I've found the visual aspects  marketplace  and logical UI of Unity much easier to work with  personally.
2453,Not surprised  Teslas look and have the quality of a 25k car but you pay an insane premium for a badge and some performance. No sane person buys the Model S over the Porsche.  Edit: Tesla fans mad  Id be mad too if Id just spent six figures for my car to be built like shit.
2454,"Not that I know of. For your own purposes  you could use ""d+"" or or ""d"" or ""d"" to indicate stepping-up the dice size  and ""d-"" or ""d"" or ""d"" to indicate stepping-down the dice size.  **Edit:** in hindsight  the ""step up/down"" phrasing that /u/ArcanistCheshire and /u/GrokMonkey pointed out are probably better solutions (unless you're limited to two characters or something)."
2455,Not that Im biased but  the Lexus F cars.   It sits in such a weird niche  and the ISF has held onto its value like mad. If you want a sporty V8 sedan/coupe thats Japanese  the compass only really points to Lexus.
2456,Not that one should take these leaked results as anything substantial but having checked some of the recent 6600 reviews that used a 5950x. The performance of the 12900k in R6 and Tomb raider seems like its generaly in the ballpark of the 5950x.  Ofc we really need to wait for actual reviews aswell as DDR5 testing to see if the platform will gain much from it.
2457,Not to dissuade you   but this is why I eventually gave up  sold everything  and just started doing 2D terrain.   Prior to that however  lots of magnets  lots of tackleboxes  lots of Rubbermaid containers  and lots and lots of home made wooden boxes.  If I were to restart now  I'd probably make sure that it was all one system that stacked and attached to each other and fit together well.  Lots of milkcrates and maybe the Dewalt Tough System.
2458,Not wanting to play armchair psychiatrist  OP  but as someone with ADHD and bipolar who often does this exact same thing - this to me is indicative of perhaps some underlying executive dysfunction. That is  these cognitive/ruminative loops we can find ourselves on due to any number of factors - depression  anxiety  stress or another similar condition.   Highly worth checking in with a psychologist or other professional around this. For me  exploring this behaviour in therapy led my psychologist and I to doing schema therapy interventions for the rumination and some psychological factors alongside that.   Definitely consider seeking some support  it will be helpful. I know exactly where you're coming from though  and it's certainly when my mental health is at its most challenged that this exact behaviour worsens.
2459,Nothing is above a remake. Nothing is perfect and was never intended to be perfect. Some games were just good enough and were barely held together with hope.   Seriously  some of the classic games really do need a fresh coat of paint  have all of the bugs ironed out  and given better translations. Xenogears needs a major overhaul. There is a point in the first disc where the game ran out of something. Ambition  money  I don't know. Everything from that point onward was rushed  made no sense  and gave us a confusing mess of a game. That game needs a modern remake that basically completes the game. Also  while we are wishing  the dialog needs to be cut by about 75 percent. It was verbal diarrhea like Eternal Sonata. The only thing that made it bearable was the fact that it was completely silent.
2460,"Now dont get me wrong. I dont just play any RPG i cant stand dragon age inquisition  MMO rpgs  Looter based RPGs and so on. But i find myself enjoying CRPGs more like wasteland 3 baldurs gate  divinity. Still love bethesda  I liked outer worlds were not the best game ever but it was okay.  &#x200B;  Like i get less and less free time BUT i just like having one [game.](https://game.One) One game you keep playing everyday that you slowly make progress in take your time watch some NPCs idle  listen too the ambience sounds  Stay and just enjoy the music. Like been playing wasteland 3 now for a week only stopping too play battlegrounds with 2 friends.  &#x200B;  Like i dont care that i could play 10 shorter games if i stopped playing wasteland. But why should i? Buyng 10 shorter games is not good for the pocket. And should i just play them just too have them played?  &#x200B;  Like for a example  Little nightmares is great but i honestly just see it as a youtube game. Same with most short games (Barring Journey  Abzu  Flower) I just like having those on in the background while i go about my day.  &#x200B;  And also you would be suprised on how much time you save when you are in college and saving time means time for more RPGs. If you dont drink alcohol and party. You sleep better which means less hours spent laying in bed feeling like you wanna die and jump out your window. You got more energy. YOU SAVE MONEY. You get more in shape!  Trust me the ""College life"" Is not that special.  &#x200B;  What will benefit your life more? Short time pleasure and partying one night stands? Or playing an amazing RPG  Eating healthy  Learning music  And studying. Also one night stands are  awkward as all hell when you wake up the next morning.  &#x200B;  Oh it was about RPGs yes sorry about getting carried away. Play longer games and stick too that dam game it will pay off in the end. Also you kinda reset your dopamin receptors which makes it so that you can enjoy even longer games  Hey win win guys!  &#x200B;  Thats all from me hope you have a good day! And play wasteland 3."
2461,Now i am checking my phone for this effect and it has it on landscape orientation  but it's very very very slight  practically unnoticeable. In the new ipad mini the jelly scrolling looks noticeable as hell even in youtube reviewer videos  to the point where it's probably annoying to some users
2462,Nowadays  any type of warrior mage is an interesting character to me. Be it a Pathfinder Magus  D&D Spellblade or just the typical Bard  that's what I'm all about. In Final Fantasy that would be the Red Mage.
2463,Numbers mean nothing when your processor is being cooked at 95'C+ all the time. I'll be going back to intel once they figure out thermals. Hopefully  10nm or beyond rectifies this issue.  I like a quiet computer.
2464,Nvidia will have to enable 4 GPCs of the GA104 and that means the ROP count would be bumped-up to 64 because the GA104 has only eight SMs per GPC compared to GA106's ten  and each GPC has 16 ROPs.   Either that  or Nvidia will simply enable half of the GA104 which will bring down the core count to 3072 at same 48 ROPs.  Let's see.
2465,O ya ive seen that before. You need to shave them down. Make them smooth. Theyll ride a lot better then /s  You are absolutely right. Thats fishy and theres an issue. As many have said it sounds like a balance issue. That mechanic is a real dick
2466,OAT coolant definitely doesn't need to be changed until its defined interval or if it's been mixed and started making deposits. Mopar coolant is 10yr  150 000 mile.   Brake fluid can be done whenever. I've never seen brake fluid less than 50k that I've recommended without something serious. I had a 20 year old car for 5years and the brakes never got squishier  but it's quite arid where I live
2467,"Obligatory ""don't play it without the unofficial patch"" comment.  And honestly  I'm not sure what to tell you. I don't know what you consider to be a steep learning curve. All of the games that you mentioned are all so painfully similar that it's hard to get a gauge of what you like outside of mainstream ""man on the ground""  scenarios.  I think it's a great experience and I enjoyed it even when it was riddled with bugs before any patches came around. There's no way for us to tell you how janky *you're* going to find it."
2468,Octopath traveler has the story broken into 4 chapters per character. and you can do them at your own pace. It's not entirely episodic  but each characters stories are not really related to one another so you can do a chapter of one and relax before moving on to the next chapter - or just starting the first chapter of another character. The chapters aren't terribly long individually.
2469,Odd taxi and Horimiya where the highlights of this year for me. Shiguang Dailiren  86 and Nomad were also fun to watch. i haven't watched whole lot from the summer season but i heard that sunny boy was really good.
2470,Odyssey has basically nothing to do with the story of the previous games so it is a good place to jump into the series for the first time. I like the Shadow of Mordor games better but if you never played this type of game you will really enjoy it I think. Not to mention it is inspired by the Witcher games in a few ways too
2471,Odyssey has some RPG mechanics (skill trees  gear and weapons you have to constantly replace or upgrade  etc.) but at its heart it's an action game.   It's fun as hell  and has an absolutely beautiful world  but holy hell is it ever bloated. It is a LONG game if you want to see and do even most things. (Which I did  because it was one of my favorite video game worlds to exist in.)  Origin and Odyssey were dramatic reworks of the AC formula  so it's hard to really recommend earlier games in the series; they're even less like RPGs  and have much stiffer controls. Long time fans of the series prefer some of the earlier games  but Origins and Odyssey tend to appeal to people who never really played AC games before.
2472,"Of course it's good to have Fido back  but not too happy that they pull the ""oh they were not really dead"" card  especially after that tragic scene seeing snapshots of his life from his pov.  Otherwise  great episode  I especially liked the snap transition from Eugene's death flag to his arm with the necklace  skipping the battle."
2473,Of course! Theyre rare  but not unheard of. The Audi RS3 uses an inline-5. That engine has been used in a few vw/audi products over the years. Volvo used a few 5-bangers back in the day and Acura even put a 5-cylinder in the old 2.5 tl.  I think they sound really cool  totally unique growl.
2474,"Of course! We should have known to set the laptop in the ""semi-hypoxic incapacitation"" mode. Obviously not ""unihemispheric slumber "" ""psuedocoma "" ""postprandial dilatory metabolic state "" or  you know  ""sleep."" Because computer interfaces get more and more intuitive over time  and as we all know  passengers have a tendency to spontaneously combust during ""sleep"" on planes."
2475,Off topic a bit but if you like survival style games without bugs try the long dark.  It has a great story and very challenging.  I used to play rpg religiously now I dont have patience for it all so I found survival games. Open world. No stupid quests and very few of any npc.  If not AC Valhalla turned out really well.
2476,Often people who analyze things aren't the people who make those things. Food critics aren't chefs  wine reviewers don't make wine  building inspectors aren't architects. This is very normal for someone to analyze something without also building that thing. It gives an outside perspective which is often more valuable than a biased perspective from someone who also builds the things they critique.
2477,"Oh  I actually know of one  but it's more of an anomaly than anything I'd really want to see replicated.  There's an odd JRPG from 2008 called *The Last Remnant* and the leveling system is... strange.  The more you fight  the more your combat level goes up for each of the squads that you command based on battle frequency... but that just changes the enemies  not you.  Stat gains are separate from that level  and have different requirements as well as troop moral  number and types of units and skills you can learn.  What's sort of odd about this is grinding is not only penalized  there's actually a few real possibilities to soft lock your entire save by encountering a boss that you've inadvertently leveled up too much making the encounter essentially impossible.  If you play the game ""right"" the game does get easier near the end  but only because you have more options in battle and you've gotten the squad system down."
2478,Oh  nice! I played it! Got it on sale some years ago...  I finished a single run  I think. But it was not quite what I expected. Maybe that's my fault for not reading the description well enough/looking at reviews.. I liked the idea and the art but not the roguelike elements and the dice combat .  But hey  it was cheap  so... I hope every little bit helps :)
2479,oh man! since I was a kid  about 5 years old of not younger. I remember making race tracks on the living room floor with my older brother out of a box of pencil crayons. We would build entire cities  visit the pretend gas station and each others houses. I still have my white Ferrari F40 that my daughter now plays with. With real cars  when my Dad got a 1989 Fox Body Mustang  I can still pick out the sound of those old 5.0's from blocks away!
2480,Oh no  Im liking this show way too much. Sometimes Im even playing scenes back  so I can catch all the little details in the background.  This was such a good episode. Chief is a real bro. Im digging how Natsumi teases Futaba. Kazama expressions are hilarious: first we had him having (inner)fun with the earth vs. sun-thingy. Only a little while later we saw him shocked and confused by Futabas  ehm  enlargement. Him and Sakurai were very adorable together as well. And Takeda just slam dunked a pervert to protect Futaba.  Gawd  I love this show so far. For the upcoming ten weeks  every Saturday  Ill be like a junkie who needs his fix.
2481,"Oh wow what a commercial SYMMETRICAL AWD. Like it's some crazy thing only found on WRX.  Let's clarify. Symmetrical only means equal length axles  NOTHING ELSE. And quite frankly there is no proven benefit in doing so  Symmetrical AWD is just result of engine being longitudinal. Audi has it  Hyundai has it and any car that has AWD platform with longitudinal engine layout. So aside from that Subaru is hyping us into ""NEW"" WRX which seems not much different than current WRX. Subaru is great in advertising. After owning few Subaru's I have some suggestions to the brand.   1. Make equal length exhaust manifolds on all your performance cars. Fuck the sound  most people buy these for performance. Keeping unequal length manifolds just for sound is same as Harley Davidson and their V2 with broken sound  just because some people are used to it. 2. Use modern version of your boxer engine and fix issues on it. After so many years of building these you could have reliable engine  capable of increased power output without massive amount of money needed to be invested. Porsche somehow makes reliable and powerful boxer engines and if you need advice on reliability ask Mitsubishi about their 4G63. 3. Don't be a bitch and make your STI models twin turbo  Legacy in Japan was sold like this ages ago and it was an awesome setup. If somebody desires massive power they can always convert it to single turbo. 4. Forget about paddle shifters. Nobody who buys WRX or STI wants god damn paddle shifter. MANUAL TRANSMISSION. 5. Stop BS people into this ""boxer is better because has low center of gravity"" bullshit. Sure boxer in WRX or STI is 1"" lower than for example 4G63 in EVO but at the same time is 6"" more forward. Which at the end makes no difference when driving  actually making Subaru platform more prone to understeer. Guess how I know? I owned both.  6. Forget about electronics diffs and all this computer nonsense. People want good old ""driver car"". Nobody gives a fuck at the race track if they can have drift mode and 6 different settings in the center diff. Put mechanical diffs in it and make it drive like proper performance car. The only ""setting"" option that I need is to switch my drive by wire throttle to 1:1 ratio  so I am in charge  not the computer."
2482,Oh yeah. I find that I can generally get my players on board for a one shot here and there to try out new things.    They don't usually go in for a full game changeover  but it helps keep things fresh.
2483,"Ok  I've read that Steam review and it looks like your ""toxic fans"" are probably only that one person. That review is seriously bonkers  I reported it and the user. I don't have much advices to give you as I never had to deal with this level of crazy/toxic :S  If you have enough evidences of the harassment you could eventually go to the authorities with it  That sucks but don't give up gamedev for this if you like creating games.  I hope it will get better for you :)"
2484,Ok so have you or have you not taken the car to the dealership?  I can tell you as someone that owns a dealership if you let a battery go totally dead and it cant be revived because of that then it generally wont be covered by warranty.   Generally (I do not own an Acura store though) we have to run a test  if the battery fails the test warranty will cover it for a certain period of time depending on the manufacturer. Of the battery failed because it was allowed to stay discharged for an extended period of time thats on you Im afraid. The manufacturer wont allow us to cover it.   Understand that dealers generally dont make the call  the manufacturer tells us what they will and will not cover.
2485,Ok so hear me out because it will make sense once I explain. So Persona 1 was a pretty flawed game with some interesting ideas. The dungeon designs were pretty bland  combat was decent  and the story was pretty interesting. It also had it's flaws  but it was still a decent game overall  with the best aspect being it's story imo.   Then Persona 2 comes along and the story is like really fucking good. The characters are great  the combat is better  the music is amazing  and we have ourselves an all-around amazing (if dated) JRPG. Sure there's still random encounters and some clunky mechanics  but damn is Persona 2 a gem. This refers to both Innocent Sin and Eternal Punishment.  Then we have Caligula Effect. Very fitting because it was directed by the same guy who directed Persona 1. The dungeons are bland and one of the weaker aspects of the game  rhe story is mixed for some people  but it has some interesting ideas and heavy themes  the combat is excellent  the music is amazing  and the game overall is very flawed and mixed  but there's some really strong and interesting ideas that make the game enjoyable overall.   Then Caligula Effect 2 comes out and BAM. Everything is better. The dungeons are so much better  with tons of variety and even some interactivity  the story is better  the characters are better and are actually really good (according to the reviews I've seen)  the themes are even more interesting and are expressed in much better ways with much better execution  the combat is just as fantastic  and the music is just as amazing  if not better than the first game.   In both of these instances we have flawed games with interesting ideas that have sequels that vastly improve on everything and make for fantastic JRPGs overall. In just saying  Noisy Pixel gave Caligula Effect: Overdose a 7 and Caligula Effect 2 a 9.5. I haven't received the game yet  as basically no one has  but damn do those reviews  gameplay  and trailers have me convinced. This is what sequels should be for a series! I just thought it was interesting how similar this situation is for moving from Persona 1 to 2.
2486,Ok so I know I'm throwing a stone to the sky but maybe you guys can help me.    So.. there was this anime I used to love watching during 5th grade I think. After all this time and I've almost forgot everything but little fragments.     1. There was a scene where mysterious cards started falling fr the sky (start of the plot)    2. Strange robo-balls  when thrown on the cards  the grow into a giant monster and stuff. (The MC had a white  ball I think)     Can you guess with this little information I provided?
2487,Okay  cross country race in an older car  here's what i'd do:  Stripped out interior  moderately tuned engine with extra cooling (Personally  i'd avoid forced induction if you're going to be running at high RPM for long periods of time.)  Big fuel cell  Full sized spare  A tiny bit more suspension travel if possible via aftermarket springs/shocks. You're going to be traveling at high speeds so you don't want loose suspension  but you need extra travel because you'll be on roads that are much bumpier than a race track.   An alignment setup for stability over maneuverability.  &#x200B;  If the person racing has a bunch of money to spend on the engine  a supercharger or a turbocharger would make sense  but you're really increasing the risk factor with those power adders  which is the opposite of what you'd want in an endurance race.
2488,"Okay  first post here. Been learning game programming for a week now. Slow process but im kindda getting the hand of it. I need help with a certain code. Im trying to figure out how it's working overall.  Im using Unity as my game engine and Visual studio code as my IDE. (C#)   The code (variable) being :  float lane  = Input.getAxis(""Horizontal"");   What I know :   1. FLOAT is the type of variable  in that case number with up to 6 decimals.  2. LANE is the name of my variable  3. I Believe INPUT is my class  4. GETAXIS is a method alrighty made by unity   Now  what im wondering is why i can put the data of the variable as a string? I read online that the method GETAXIS is basically numbers that goes from -1 to 1 wich make sens. But how is it that i can put words as the data?  Thank you for responding on hitting me up.  Edit : thank you for the answers guys it really helped me :D"
2489,Okay  I will be blunt: It looks boring.  There are a bazillion survival base builders and I have no idea why yours should be any better  but I don't even see the survival part in your trailer. Are there even enemies? Is there combat? It looks like you just run around and mine scrap/rocks(which is generally a boring thing to do) to build some things.   The landscape also looks fairly boring  which is especially an issue for something that looks basically like a walking sim with base building.  From an influencer point of view  I wouldn't touch it. Like what should I show the viewers? How I just mine resources  walk through an empty monotonous world and build a few buildings? Look at the other popular survival builders  how would you compete with them? What makes your game stand out? Some give you an ridiculous amount of creative freedom  have giant trolls attack your base  hordes of zombies or giant insects that just pop out or are simulation heavy.   Without playing your game  just judging by the trailer and description  it looks like an unfinished Satisfactory with less content and a depressing/dull world.  > We have tried to make a fucking epic game here   This is usually a bad idea when you lack resources. A fucking epic game needs a fucking epic team with a fucking epic budget  or the game quality suffers.
2490,"Okay  so  I've been watching AoT  we finished it (at least what's available to us) and now I'm looking for something akin to AoT.  I've tried watching:  \- Death Note (too slow for her)  \- Parasite/Parasyte (can't remember how to spell it  she seemed to like it but we haven't watched it in a while)  She's looking for anime that is gory  has a lot of action and good story like AoT. I was personally thinking either ""K"" or FMA or FMA:B.   We usually watch one or two episodes on a weekday and \~3-5 episodes on each day of the weekend.  I'm sorry if this isn't the right place to ask for help  if it isn't  please direct me to the sub that's appropriate for this question.  Thanks!"
2491,Okay  so mine is when anime girls compare bust and one is jealous of the other  or when like the bras dont fit or something. Its weird I know  but dont judge Any anime/anime scenes to recommend that have that? What fetish has anime got you into?
2492,Okay it's only episode 2 and I'm already loving this show. I did check out some of the manga. And Man  Doga Kobo is really putting in the works for such a small series (sorry Igarashi).   Really rooting for Igarashi's adventures and for the side ship of Sakurai (OL Anju) and Kazama. Also her Grandpa is a Fucking Absolute Unit holy shit
2493,Okay so if you have 2 players both rolling 1 that is same probability of  1 person rolling 2 charters at 7. If you have two players rolling all really shit gear  that is less probability than 1 player rolling really good gear. Idk what dice are used in these rolls  but given you mentioned 7 being almost maximum its probably a d8 or d10? Its really not hard to roll hot or cold on dice that small over a couple of rolls.
2494,Okay so the responses to this are quite varied  but still very interesting to hear everyone's thoughts.  The thing is that I'm considering to write a book  the topic is to find a way that you can make appealing art as soon as possible with mostly the skills you already have. For programmers and artists that want to find a smarter path.  I just started recently  the thing is I really need to find some people who feel like they could use this type of book. But then I need to understand those people first. Feel free to DM me  reply or find my email address on my website (link in bio) if you would like to get involved.  I would be very grateful!
2495,okay. but wtf was that politician though. idk whether the tears were real or not. also wtf was that trying to listen gesture? i thought gintoki was over reacting but the politician was just as comical.
2496,"OMG I was thinking ""Eugene don't death flag yourself"" and within a minute...   Good and emotive reunion scene with Fido though; of only they can swap the 2 in sequence then we don't have to end the episode in a depression... But then that wouldn't be 86 huh...  Looks like discrimination and rejection takes many forms huh; even here they are still referred to as 86-ers by some; although good to see not all are like that. I hope we can cut to Lena soon.   We're sucker's for self inflicted punishment I tell us :)"
2497,On a recent podcast  Linus  who switched most of his screens to OLEDs some time ago  and actively used them  claimed that burn-in is absolutely a thing. The video might be coming out in the near future.
2498,On both and Wrath of the Righteous you can build a party as you see fit. Either you take your followers and level them up with whatever class you like (you can multiclass) or you hire mercenaries which you build from scratch. If you enjoyed the first one go ahead and get the new one  you should have a blast.
2499,On paper they are comparable and very cheap.  I've not driven one but resale is atrocious and only tradies I see using them are either one man outfits or the entry level workers. They tend to drive them into the ground.     A friend bought an ldv van (saic motor corporation) and it was replaced under warranty at 3yrs for rust.   If I needed a ute and money was no object I'd get the Toyota   on a budget the mitsi looks pretty good.
2500,On the flip side  you made money and it's a vehicle you should be able to hunt down again when life allows for it. At least it wasn't something with more sentimental value and less cash value that you where forced to part ways with for a loss.
2501,On the indie hobbyist side  dev largely under estimate the amount of work required to take a game from concept to finished product and get hit with bunout. On the large studio side  a proof of concept test may fail to get decent reaction of the target audience in marketing tests  new release in the same genre might have terrible sales  or major shift in the popularity of genre.
2502,On the plus side this is the best time for this type of thing to happen since the car market is insane. In any other year you would probably still be paying off the loan even after selling the car.   Also  since they are going to keep making the Miata you can always buy another one when your financial situation stabilizes and the market cools off.
2503,One approach is to work backwards. How much damage can a player deal? Figure out their average damage per round of combat (don't forget to account for accuracy and crits if those are factors in your system)  then multiply that by the number of rounds you want the monster to survive.  Example: each player has a 50% chance to hit and deal 2d6 damage  so on average they'll each deal 7 damage on a hit  for 3.5 damage per round. 3.5 damage times 3 players = 10.5 damage. Times 6 rounds of combat = 63 HP.
2504,One benefit is shorter stroke means you can use longer rods  which reduces the angle of the rods and allows them to push the crank more efficiently.   Sometimes engines are destroked to meet displacement rules in racing  outside of that it's usually valve train that limits max rpm.
2505,One big thing to add to the list of what defines an RPG is having NPCs you can walk up to and converse with at will. It seems every game defined as an RPG has this element. Without that the game will always fall into another genre.
2506,One glance at another system I almost already to jump ship.   Played savage worlds a few times & it threw me off d&d 5E forever.   D&D is an average system at best with a huge budget. Once I realised the game is designed to sell  not to ease play as much as possible  I cant look at it the same way.
2507,One habit that might work for you - I know some creators watch/read stuff twice  once to experience the work  the second time to look at the moments and take notes.  But! OP  I agree with comments that suggest counseling on this  first. The interference in your enjoyment (of both media and rpgs) feels more serious than just needing the right coping mechanisms.
2508,One idea:      Inventories are arrays of Stacks     Stacks are an Item Type plus a Current Quantity and Max Quantity         Stacks also have other metadata  e.g. Owner ID     Item Type is an ID {sword|knife|etc.}     Item has an Item Type  One layer up        The thief moves a stack from the target to their inventory     Viewing the inventory  current inventory owner ID is compared against Stack inventory owner ID     If they match  show stack normally     If they don't match show stack as stolen  And another use-case:      The thief finds a stack in a treasure chest and adds it to their inventory     The stack has no owner id  so the thief assigns their ID  This would also facilitate showing more than one stack in the UI -- e.g. ammo in RE8.
2509,"One mechanic I usually find interesting is the ability to learn skills from enemies.  In an old flash RPG series  MARDEK  there's a robot character named Legion. When attacked by specific monster moves  it'll learn it and be able to use it itself. Legion becomes a very flexible attacker once the skills list is built up. Notably  one of the skills allows it to attack with 2 elements no other characters have access to (Fig & Thauma). There are also a select few bosses with a ""nuke"" attack dealing high damage to all enemies  which Legion can also learn when hit by it. This system allows Legion to have a variety of semi-unique moves that otherwise wouldn't fit thematically in the other characters' kits.   Breath of Fire 3 has an examine mechanic where you observe an enemy  hope they perform a particular attack  and hope the character learns it. Learning things is pretty tedious but I still found it interesting how you can pick up a good variety of skills from it. And back then  I couldn't really use walkthroughs so I had some fun seeing an enemy perform a new move and wondering if I could learn that.   Besides those  I haven't really played any more recent RPGs that have this kind of mechanic. I know a lot of roguelikes have it ""reversed"" where monsters are pretty much just player characters  using the same attacks but with their stats and other numbers adjusted depending on the monster."
2510,One moment hes smiling and raising death flags  and the next moment hes lying in a pool of blood asking for his sister. In a series full of incredibly well-executed death scenes  this one does not miss.
2511,One of my favorite JRPGs ever. Loved the story and characters. I played the first SH and it was ok  so I didn't have many expectations for SHC  and boy was I pleasantly surprised! SH3 was enjoyable but never came close to SHC's awesomeness.
2512,One of my favorite parts of TCG anime is being able to understand the actual gameplay and the strategies to their real-word equivalent. It's especially fun because no matter how not meta a build is  TCG anime try to treat most decks with a level of similar power. This episode introduced some more mechanics  like Buster cards (I'm assuming these are just a general trait a certain % of cards have and there are a lot of effects based off of triggering them) and Life Shot  at least I think that is what its called. While I wished they explained these mechanics more  I was able to follow along. They also didn't mention that a monster dies from taking damage equal to its attack  meaning something with 2000 attack could kill something 120000 attack if there was enough damage already taken. I guess then even reducing a monster's attack could lead to death  which is a neat idea and gives emphasis to stat reduction and stat management. They also never mentioned it  but apparently if a monster's attack goes down to 0 it instantly dies. Anyways  I enjoyed the fight and it was fun to see these two decks fight. I thought the new girl was okay  but the final minutes where she completely changed to the sweet  innocent  and devoted kouhai archetype really killed her for me.
2513,One of my favourites is a crystalline city bordering the desert and the sea. There was fractal dust  characters of myth and everyday  complex politics  and a lot of drama from the embassy.  This was in **i'm sorry  did you say street magic**  so it was very much a collaborative creation process. I did a sketch of it  actually; [you can see it here](https://twitter.com/KurtRefling/status/1283095029477777408/photo/2).
2514,One of the few vehicles I can think of that had narrow- and wide-body variants that were actually wider *in the body*  not just widened with fender flares. The Elgrand was widened 120mm to give us the Quest in America.
2515,One Piece  because when you're at the beginning it's what you're looking for I think  but by the time you start to progress you realize it's too good to stop watching just because it's not 90s anymore.
2516,One rental DLC and some 20+ year old games? For $50?  It's like they saw PS Plus and said we can do that too  but only looked at the pricepoint and didn't want to offer up anything nearly as good in exchange.
2517,One suggestion I haven't seen (JIC the others don't pan out) if the car has AWD and you only put on two new tires then you might be binding up  although that's a super extreme case and xDrive probably splits the power only when losing traction. Just a guess.
2518,One thing I do is spread some rumors and wait to hear player theories on the truth. If the players come up with a better idea than what I had  I just steal their idea. Not only does it mean the player feels like they actually figured something important out  but you also you also have a plot point you know your players like. The players write their own game world and don't know it.
2519,One thing I've found as I play RPGs is that I really enjoy learning new RPG systems. Whether it's an interesting take on leveling  mechanics  stats  etc. I enjoy learning the intricacies of RPG systems.   Sometimes I'll play an RPG and it doesn't wow me story-wise  the gameplay is okay  and the RPG systems are just the standard run of the mill systems. I usually don't play those games for very long.
2520,One thing that helps imo is making slices/mechanics of your game in isolation. So rather than just dive in making it all at once (which a lot of people do) like chiselling a single sculpture from one piece of stone  try to make each without the others and then integrate them together. (this also often makes your systems more reusable and flexible).   Like let's say you want to make a 2d jrpg with turn based battles. You could make a simple stats system which describes the kind of attacks  damage types  health etc. Then you can use this to drive a battle between entities with sets of stats  and have it play out in a turn based manner. Notice I have not mentioned rendering at all here  you can do this as a console app or whatever  as long as you can prove the underlying combat/stat mechanics work in isolation.  Then you could make a sort of graphical 2d menu system which exposes your stat system and drives the battle system you made.  Then look at another part  like the notion of items and inventories  then tie that in so a battle can yield items  then make a front end for it which will take the item data etc and give them to an entity.  Finally you can look at making a character with stats and have them animate based on whatever drives it (movement  triggers  status effects etc) then look at making the notion of a 2d level and link it all together.  I appreciate this is super high level but the more you can break down stuff the more manageable things will end up being for you  and also the easier it is to farm out work to others in the team as you can quantify what each slice needs to do and then when it's done look at integrating it.
2521,One thing that helps me quite a bit is slowing down and enunciating strongly and clearly. I find it's more dramatic  and it also allows the players to digest the information you're presenting more easily.  Since I've put effort into this for my games  it's actually translated into a clearer and more authoritative voice at work as well.  Also  if you didn't do much reading aloud as a child  I suggest you give that a shot! Spend 10 or 15 minutes doing it every other day and I'm sure you'll see an improvement. Even better  you could practice using read-aloud boxes from published adventures.
2522,One thing that web does have that the vast majority of games are terrible at? UI.  I mean  right now I'm using absolutely horrendous UI at work  so it certainly varies  but the technology available to make those UI is so much more powerful on the web...
2523,One way to practice narration is to read books out loud  like you would read a story to someone. First you just need to have it feel smooth and natural  then you can try experimenting with shifting intonation  using silences and facial expressions for dramatic effect. You may even incorporate voices for characters if you wish.
2524,Online/play-by-post play and the way failed rolls work!   I find grids  maps  and some of the other things necessary for DnD combat to be unwieldy in Discord text games and online voice chat. (I know you don't necessarily *need* them for DnD combat  but it is hard without them). I've found that PbtA games like Monster of the Week work better online; I still love DnD in person  but I'd rather play something more freeform online.  Additionally  I've found that games built with mixed successes in mind seem to be more my cup of tea - I dislike the binary success/fail rolls of DnD and like systems with good guidelines for interesting failures like Dungeon World.
2525,Only 4800+ MHz DDR4? That's a bit low  did they only certify compatibility with B-die?  EDIT: To give some context to my comment: the [MSI X570S Unify-X MAX is specified for 5300+ MHz](https://www.msi.com/Motherboard/MEG-X570S-UNIFY-X-MAX/Specification)  granted it's limited to 5100 for Matisse/Vermeer  but it's still quite a bit higher. The [Gigabyte X570S Aorus Master](https://www.gigabyte.com/Motherboard/X570S-AORUS-MASTER-rev-10/support#support-doc) is specified for 5400 MHz (APUs)  while it's listed a 5100 MHz kit for Vermeer/Matisse.  The reason I suspect they only certified compatibility with B-die is because there are no commercial B-die kits specified above 4800 MHz. This is the only kit I know of from G.Skill: https://www.gskill.com/product/165/184/1620121714/F4-4800C17D-16GVK
2526,Only complaint I have is the lack of an original system. Something like Pokemon  Avatar  or even Danny Phantom might work better with a custom set of rules than trying to shove it into a pre-existing game.  > knowing all or most of the answers to key elements of the world  Depends on the players. If I'm doing Star Wars or other popular settings there's a session zero about not trying to intentionally interact with famous main characters. That goes double for trying to meta-game major world changing events. Having a player try to remove Johannes Gutenberg from history  to delay the invention of the printing press a decade  isn't going to be fun for the GM.
2527,"Only if the wheel ends up with a different diameter because of the height of the rims and the tires.   There are calculators that let you track the change  and you can get it close enough that the effect is negligible. And if you are making a major alteration  you can install devices that correct for that.  As an example  I'm looking for a set of 16"" rims for my Infiniti G20. The stock tire size is 185/65R14. The size I plan to run is 205/50R16. With that difference  the diameter goes from 23.5"" to 24.1""  an increase of 2.6%. Not high enough for me to care about the discrepancy  especially when the car is hardly an example worthy of meme prices on BaT. It's a beater that I plan on autocrossing a lot."
2528,Only if you think you won't like starting with any other show.  Cowboy Bebop is a very 'westernized' anime  it has both visual and storytelling elements that are more typical of western media rather than japanese media. This makes it more appealing to many people who dislike japanese styles  but it also means it's not very representative of what anime consists of. Therefore  while it can serve as an 'entry point' for people who wouldn't otherwise get into anime at all  if you really want to experience anime as its own medium then I recommend starting with something more firmly embedded in the japanese tradition.
2529,Oof   I know I said Eugene was a walking death flag lightning rod last week  but he got killed off in the most nonchalant way possible.   In one scene  he and Shin were still happily chatting away in the mess hall when the battle stations siren rang  and then boom  cut to the next scene where he's already fatally wounded (with his arm blown off a few meters away).  RIP Eugene  we barely knew you. Shin recovered his Grim Reaper handgun just in time to do his duty again.  Still no Lena for the second consecutive episode. :( And in-universe wise  it's been nearly 9 months since they left San Magnolia and last heard Lena's voice. Though next episode's title seems to hint at the reunion? I could be wrong.  BTW  where are Shin's friends? Have they been assigned to other theaters in the war? At least he's got his own loli mascot Frederica to constantly cheer him up.  And finally: FIDO LIVES! (And good on the Federacy on making a stone tablet to commemorate the fallen 86 from Spear Head  the name list retrieved from the former Fido's remains)
2530,Oooo  this makes me happy to read. I've tried playing 1 a couple of times and I can see it's potential and I was really digging it but the constant random encounters made it feel like I wasn't really getting anywhere.    I wanted to play out 1 before 2 but I think I may just leave it and try 2 on its own when it comes.
2531,OP  have you tried to make a game from an actual engine or how do you approach to make games ?  Coming from web dev  there are plenty of Html5 engines you could choose:  * three.js (editor is behind official build  very common among websites that use realtime 3d  a lot of tutorial resources) * babylon.js (community editor  very similar to three.js) * playcanvas (decent online editor but online ide => hard to git) * cocos creator (i strongly suggest this because it has usable editor like Unity  though severely lack of good tutorial on youtube).  there are still plenty more you could view from this [https://html5gameengine.com/](https://html5gameengine.com/) But i would recommend you to look at the above 4 first  because they all have editor and are all open-source engines
2532,OP  I think that this just means you're a creative person  liking to analyse how things are put together. In another context you might be/have been using those interests to analyse a play for an English literature essay  work in advertising. It's quite normal to be compulsive and critical-analytical about doing Arts creative activities  like practicing a musical instrument  sketching everywhere  or whatever. Of *course* you don't need some behavioural psychologist who doesn't 'get' that to stick some labels on you. RPG may be 'just a game'  throwaway  and plagiaristic  but it can be very creative. It's like the Bill Shankly quote about football. Roleplaying isn't life and death. It's far more important than that! ;-)   For when you want to switch it off  here are some thoughts: Turn off the lights when you watch the film or TV show in the evening so you can't see to write. Tell yourself that you can always re-watch this some time  should you need to. Remember that when you're looking down at your notebook you're not looking at the screen and so missing things. There are some shows and films where there's a hell of a lot going on in the background and details the whole time. One film example of that is the St. Trinians film re-makes  where there are constant examples of the crazyness at a pace. A TV show example of that would be the UK's 'The Hustle'  where elements of the con and back-up plan are going on the whole time. It could be that the thing you thought might inspire doesn't really offer anything fresh and useful and inspiration may strike when you're least expecting it. The film was dull  but the view from the bus window gave you an idea.   Get the urge out of your system by following through. Tell the group you'll be running a game and the inspiration is ..let's say 'The Godfather'. Now you won't be worrying about any media that isn't relevant to your thing of the moment. You can happily watch other things as a break from it. The tendency will be put to good use  checking specifics as you prep. I've run games based on films and TV shows before now and did a lot of re-watching. A lot of times someone will have already done the work for you with some online fan website wiki  saving you a lot of time trying to find 'that bit'. They'll be really useful when there are a too many series and episodes to wade through (Star Trek)  or where there are many useful one episode characters. In other words  instead of hoping the inspiration will give you an idea of something to run  have the idea of what you want to run and then the research is immediately relevant  used and supplying answers to your specific prep questions. How old is Jean Luc Picard? What are Andy's outfits in the Devil Wears Prada? Let's look at that Star Wars cantina interior again to describe it well.
2533,OP  why is this so hard   Call up your auto insurance  change your deductible to the lowest amount (lets say $100 for Comp/coll). Wait a week... have a rock find its way to the glass.  When asked how it happened...  I was driving and it happened  strange as hell
2534,OP I applaud you. Being a husband first and foremost is not easy. This does mean you have to make sacrifices as a marriage is not 50/50 . A marriage is 100/100. I cannot say I have been in the same situation as you however  I do know what it feels like to get go of something you love and that brought you tons of happiness. I had to sell a few cars once I moved from rural Pennsylvania to the larger city of Philadelphia for work. This ranged from parts cars  ongoing projects and my fully restored air cooled beetle :( For me  working on cars was something I did with my son and that I did to unplug from reality. A car such as the miata really helps you unplug from the world just by going on a drive. I know youll miss the thing but there will be plenty of time for cars in the future. You made the right choice dude hang in there!
2535,OP is fun and ED is cute. I'm usually bad at noticing these things  but I really like the backgrounds in this anime. It stands out more to me for some reason and makes it feel more alive. The staff at Doga Kobo did a great job.  Chief is also a bro.
2536,OpenEmu on Mac makes emulators tidy and fun and usable.  It has Mednafen core for PS1 emulation.  RetroArch is maddening if youre new and trying to use the menus  but its pretty good when you get used to it.  Both work great for PS1 even on my old computer from 2009.
2537,Or  you could have a single array of all items  and each item has a set of flags like sword  armor  enchanted  and when  for example  the player clicks the enchanted item button  the game iterates through the array and shows only items with the enchanted flag.
2538,Or you could just set up your own website for the game. That's a bit of work and costs you the equivalent of a Starbucks coffee each month  but it means that you get 100% of the revenue.  The discoverability on most of those platforms is not that good anyway  unless you already do a lot of promotion by yourself.
2539,Organize your project in a way that you notice when you are about 5% through whether or not the idea is working. By doing those parts first which give you the strongest data about your core game idea and showing it to an audience.
2540,Other fire emblem games.  If you liked awakening I reccomend you play **Path of radiance ** Easy enough for a newcomer to the series  yet it still packs a punch and it has more than enough player expression/ funny builds to make. The story is also very good.
2541,Other rumors indicate 4GB/min. Either way thats over a gigabit per second. These bitrates are ludicrous.  EDIT: I am stupid. Byte = 8 bits for some reason I thought it was 16. 4GB/min is half a gigabit per second. 6GB/min would be 0.8 gigabit. Still ludicrous but not as much as I had initially suggested.
2542,Other systems I use are better than D&D for a specific thing I want to achieve.  &#x200B;  Example: Traveller and BRP (d100/Mythras/Stormbringer/etc.) has a very low power curve  players don't level up  don't have any bonuses against NPCs. These are great if you are looking for noir flavor: violence is much less frequent  but more brutal. (also  fights end very fast  especially in Traveller)  Example 2: theoretically  you could hack D&D until it resembles King Arthur and the knights of the round table  but it will never be as flavorful as Pendragon.
2543,"Our group wanted to try out different systems and genres of game. D&D does not support all campaign concepts or styles of play so if you want to do things other than heroic fantasy  you gotta branch out.  But I think the way this question is framed creates a binary that doesn't exist. We didn't ""move away from D&D "" we tried some new things  and periodically we *return* to D&D because the concept we want to play fits that system well... or (and I'm entering blasphemous territory for r/rpg now) we simply want to play it again because D&D is fun!"
2544,"Our regular player group if full of GMs  so we're regularly switching back and forth from one person's game to another  so I'm kind of used to it by now after \~25+ years of playing RPGs. Some of us have gravitated towards certain types of games  like I tend to prefer investigative/Lovecraftian stuff  but I might switch between different systems (I try to do self-contained stories  so it's not so much an issue). Another guy likes more OSR D&D sort of ""heavy metal"" fantasy games  he also bounces around systems. I don't think he ever runs more than a half-dozen sessions of a game system before he moves on. Another guy tends to gravitate towards mostly pulpy Savage Worlds stuff and tries to keep his campaigns running for awhile (we just wrapped up something like a 10 yr continuous campaign a few months back). And so on with some others. We tend to move between stuff all the time with people coming and going into our regular game sessions (sometimes without a word  they just stop showing after awhile  sometimes dramatically). I've never particularly felt much attachment towards any of my characters for awhile. I think I used to  but those were back in the days when we would play for like 8hr stretches or something  before we all had spouses  kids  and jobs to deal with."
2545,Outlander is not compact suv  it's definitely bigger than compact SUV. It competes with Subaru Outback  Mazda CX9  etc.  Eclipse Cross is Mitsubishi's compact SUV.  Mitsubishi is great bang for the bucks due to the fact that all their current models are quite new because they literally stopped making sedan excepts the small little sedan mira miren something.  Glad you like the the Outlander  i almost bought it due to the fact it was so cheap compared with other cars  ended up buying a Subaru Outback instead because i didn't like the Outlander that much after the test drive.
2546,Outside of SWN  the closest I've seen are the Mongoose Traveller 1e books [Supplement 9: Campaign Guide](https://www.drivethrurpg.com/product/99707/Supplement-9-Campaign-Guide)  [Supplement 15: Powers and Principalities](https://www.drivethrurpg.com/product/125503/Supplement-15-Powers-and-Principalities?src=also_purchased)  and [Supplement 16: Adventure Seeds](https://www.drivethrurpg.com/product/126543/Supplement-16-Adventure-Seeds). Additional tools are scattered among other Traveller and Cepheus Engine publications (such as the world generation tools in Mindjammer Fate/Traveller).
2547,Over the past year I've been reading a ton of different systems. I've brought 3 to the table.  Gurps  Dungeon crawl classics  Pathfinder 2e.  Currently running a scifi campaign in gurps but group interest is waning because half the group isn't really into the system.   Seriously  considering porting it over to Stars without Number.   I was already using its faction system in the background.    My  groups adores DCC. I plan on doing a one shot in that every 4 sessions or so.
2548,"Overall circumference is the only metric of measurement that affects your speedo. For instance  my vehicle came with 16"" rims and 225/65/16"" tires. I've gone up to 17"" rims with 225/55/17"" tires. The overall circumference is within 3% so the speedo isn't affected too much. Rim diameter doesn't matter as long as the circumference of the tire on it is close to what came factory.  Edit: https://tire-calc.com/  This link is fairly good at not only allowing you to visualize compared wheel and tire combos  but also calculates the effect on your speedometer."
2549,"Paladin or Arcane Knight; whichever is available and/or more fun and tankier in a game.  >! Like for instance  in CRPGs like Baldur's Gate or Pillars of Eternity  Paladins and Arcane Knights (Fighter/Mage) are separate classes  but Arcane Knights have much more access to crowd control and are much more able to tank through attacks using superior spells while still being able to sling fireballs at enemies so I find them more fun. I find the Western RPGs  like the two listed above  tend to make Paladins a bit too narrow in what they can do. !<  >! In most JRPGs however  Paladins are usually much more fun and are usually the class that has those cool shield spells that are usually given to the magic knights in WRPGs. In fact  Arcane Knights as I see them aren't usually a thing in JRPGs and seem to have a tendancy to make the ""melee/magic"" class be kind of a squishy and/or agile spellsword  like Red Mage from Final Fantasy or Alphen from the recent Tales of Arise (in which I prefer Kisara  who is basically a Paladin). !<  >! However  I should note that Pillars of Eternity's Arcane Knight is literally a Paladin/Wizard mix. And to be fair  in DnD-based games my ideal class is Paladin/Sorcerer. !<  So I think the more I write  the more I feel more partial to Paladins."
2550,Paladins are usually my go to. I love being able to outlast anyone else in a fight (hence my penchant for tanking in general). But if I'm not tanking I'll usually be playing a ranger/bard type. And a lot of times in cRPGs  i don't like my main character to be the tank so I end up as that secondary class.
2551,Panoramic hardtop  you can't find one and the only way to get one would probably be through Mercedes classic. Wait it gets worse   you may find yourself waiting upwards of a year for it's arrival if you can swing it's price.
2552,Panty and Stocking with Garterbelt; one of the few times I recommend the the dub. Show is inspired by western cartoons (specifically 'Drawn Together') so is a little different from other anime.  Cybersix; Japanese animation based on an Argentinian for Canadian TV.  Arete Hime  The Mysterious Cities of Gold; French-Japanese coproduction. Not aged the best and certainly aimed at children. But not an awful show.  The Big O (apparently); haven't seen it myself but heard it described the 90's batman cartoon with robots. Apparently it did poorly in Japan but well enough in America to get a second season.
2553,"Part of what makes RPGs addicting is how you are rewarded with XP and money for killing enemies  completing quests  and even just discovering locations. This can be fun  but the reasons behind these mechanics in so many games is dark and cynical.  The concept of a Skinner box is that  if rewarded  we will do repetitive tasks for a lot longer. The issue  however  is that the ""rewards"" I mentioned are not substantial or fulfilling  but base and mechanical. The point is that all it takes to get addicted to repetitive tasks is to get simple rewards.  Which brings us to RPG mechanics. Getting loot and XP and gold for every little task is a part of most RPGs. I have noticed  particularly in modern game design  that these mechanics are used in a cynical way.  I brought this topic up because the last 2 games I have been playing have had exaggerated Skinner box mechanics: Fallout 4 and Assassin's Creed Odyssey.   In Fallout 4  you get XP for almost anything you do (killing enemies  disarming traps  discovering locations  crafting). This game is often labeled ""addicting""  and that is because you get base  mechanical rewards for almost every action you take in the game.  In Assassin's Creed  you get XP for killing enemies  discovering locations  and ""completing"" locations  which rewards you for combing over every land mass in the game. Unlike Fallout 4  you are forced to do ""side content"" because areas are level locked. And both games have randomized loot  which is another game mechanic added for addiction.  Narrative  as opposed to XP and loot  is one reward that is fulfilling. That's why people can  for example  read books and feverishly turn the pages in anticipation of what happens next. The problem with video games is that video game narratives are typically a lot worse than literature narratives.   Is it any wonder that RPG mechanics are being added to almost every game nowadays? Not really  because creating a well-paced narrative is harder and sells less microtransactions and DLC than a padded  repetitive game like Assassin's Creed. Are people playing these games because they are good  or because the Skinner box mechanics have them addicted to repetitive gameplay?  **Tldr** There is a time and place for RPG mechanics. I like dungeon crawling games  too. But many games nowadays are using them to mask lackluster gameplay and to pad out game length. I enjoy the narratives in Fallout 4 and Odyssey  but would I have played them for as long if they didn't have Skinner box mechanics? Interesting to think about."
2554,Path of Exile 2 looks a million times better and they proved themselves better for years.  No idea why anyone gives a shit about Diablo these days. Blizzard may have defined many genres of gaming but their superiority is dead. Stop worshiping them.
2555,Pathfinder games. You can spend *hours* on the character creation screen. For Wrath of the Righteous itsa little ridiculous. (the vast number of options)  Not much handholding in the game itself and it seems to be a solid story.
2556,"Pathfinder has been a miserable experience. Its a combat first game  which isn't a problem but the combat experience in the game is awful. There are basically 2 options  high difficulty where you have to meta build every character  spam f5/f8  waste 2 minutes prebuffing or low difficulty where the entire system is a waste of space.   Assuming you want to engage in the combat system  turn base mode is basically unplayable because the underlying system + stat tuning means 80% of your time is spent watching characters miss and turn base mode bloats game time. There are a lot of options in the difficulty menu but even if the options were accurate and informative  it still results in the scenario where you're picking between ""faceroll waste of screen time"" vs ""meta 8x bites per attack spam grease 24/7"" gameplay. There is no provided configuration that gives a baseline meaningful value to the character build and combat system. There is also no ai scripts for real time with pause mode. Players shouldn't have to pull up the difficulty menu so many times in a game because the developers tuned all encounters to mess with meta cheese builds.  Outside of combat  its just loading screens after loading screens.  Game is incredibly buggy  either in broken story paths or respec system literally breaking your save in later acts.  Gameplay experience has essentially been the polar opposite of Divinity OS2 and BG3. Compared to Larian studios  Owlcat appears to be allergic to quality of life changes to make the user experience suck less.  Reviews are positive because anybody who tried and hated kingmaker would not bother looking at this.  Try kingmaker first  Wrath is a less polished and buggier version of Kingmaker since its newly released. Last thing you want to do is spend 80 hours and have your save be broken."
2557,Pathfinder is awesome  I think people overstate the bugs  I had 500hrs in kingmaker without issues  Wrath has had some minor bugs  but nothing that affects my game.   I enjoy how sandboxy these games are  how you can do encounters 40 different ways  and the absolute wealth of classes and hybrid classes (I think 15-20 classes w 3-6 subclasses a piece.)  I wanted to like solastra  but it felt very slow to me. The actual tabletop battles are def pure dnd tabletop  but the experience felt ok at best for me  and didnt wow me as much as Pathfinder did.
2558,Pathfinder Kingmaker isn't too bad  it's as close to a table top rpg as I've seen so there is a ton of customization on your character and a host of companions. You can also hire mercenaries that can be built from the ground up but don't have the companion quests that the others do. Console version is a little buggy but i'm still enjoying it.
2559,Pathfinder: Kingmaker and Pathfinder: Wrath of the Righteous are the games you want.  Just remember to switch it to turn based combat.  Most of the other recent CRPGs will give you something similar.   Playing Persona 5 Royal is well worth it even if you've played the base game as well.  If you have a Switch  FE: Three Houses and Octopath are worth getting.   I've heard amazing things about Yakuza: Like a Dragon  but have played that one myself.
2560,Pathologic 2 is pretty versatile in terms if designing your own play through  although there are a couple of key story events that you cant change and are forced down a certain path. You have a lot of control over the outcome of the game and most events in it  though
2561,"Paying $2600 is the **ONLY** option to get 32GB of RAM. Seriously? Also it's funny marking the 11th gen CPU as an ""i7"" where it only has 4 cores and 8 threads like the i3 10100. Guess I'll be looking someplace else to upgrade my Surface Pro 6."
2562,Pendragon (as a DM)  I wanted a game that mechanized roleplaying and encouraged character behaviour.  Also love the dynastic element  really builds in a character history that lasts for several generations
2563,People  love the 1980s as a setting. It's not so much the era or nostalgia (although that does play a part)  but many players and GMs feel that the internet and pervasive smart-phone usage are too much to deal with  and would somehow ruin the game. the 1980s are close enough to be familiar  and yet far enough from cellphones to keep them out of the game.  I think the concern about cellphones / internet reflects more of a lack of imagination than a real problem  but I'm fighting against the river here.
2564,People always think they want voice changers but in practice it usually sucks.   You still have to know how to talk  the cadence and the lingo. Or it sounds silly. Like putting an elaborate effect chain on a guitar and then playing the wrong way to make use of it.
2565,People don't realize it  but unions are bad for workers now.   Back in the 60's  companies were stuck with the labor pools they had  so unions had power.   Now in 2021  companies can simply change labor pools when costs get too high. They can get contractors or outsource to other nations.  People don't realize that employment is renting people and people are fungible. If a company can get a similar product for cheaper  they will.
2566,People don't realize there are already speed limits on the autobahn near cities  too. It ain't all unlimited all the time.  Also like  you don't really wind up flooring it 24/7 anyway  you just kinda settle in to whatever speed is comfortable. For me  that was usually around 80mph in my speed3  90-100mph in the E32 750i I had  and 60 in my old FB RX7 since it was slow as all fuck  lmao   The real secret is the semi-unrestricted backroads anyway ;)
2567,People forget iOS is a free software and Apple can decide to disable its feature on a modified device. As long as there software is a free license the user doesnt own  they can choose what features to allow under what circumstances. Dont buy iPhones if you want to self-repair your device when you break it. They want only authorized repairs only  simple. Right to repair is not right to own iOS.   Oh  I forgot this argument isnt really being made by actual users who break their stuffs. Its made by people who want to profit from third-party repairs (both shops and parts makers).   Apple can get away with this because they have the data that most new phone buyers get AppleCare for 2 years- the typical length of time most people upgrade. The cost of AppleCare is temptingly cheaper than OOW repairs or even some third-party. More and more AppleCare buyers also use the iPhone upgrade program. They turn in the old phone  apple refurbs and resells it.   Everyone is in it for the money. Apple just found a way to cut others off.
2568,"People have different definitions of a ""simple basic game"". I've heard people calling RPGs simple. I've heard people calling Super Mario Bros simple.   What do you mean when you say ""simple""? Pong? Because that's about where anyone should start."
2569,People have mentioned quite a few but are missing the sequels which to me make up the majority of the top anime:  Fruits Basket the Final  Attack on Titan 4  Re: Zero 2   Kingdom 3  Slime 2  Quints 2  Beastars 2  Zombieland Saga 2  Non Non Biyori Nonstop  Dr. Stone 2  SSSS.Dynazenon  Yuru Camp 2  Dragon Maid 2  Also  nobody has mentioned Mushoku Tensei or Tokyo Revengers yet  but quite a few people really like them.
2570,People in here are getting real pedantic about wheel vs tire. For the question youre actually asking  yes  distance and speed are calculated by rotations of the wheels. Changing tire size changes how many rotations occur in a set amount of distance and time.   My truck originally came with 31 tires and I fitted oversized 33 tires. Now the speedometer and odometer reads low. My speedo will read 60mph and my gps will show my actual speed at ~65mph.   My Miata has slightly undersized tires so my speedo and odo read high. If my speedo reads 60mph  my gps will read closer to 57mph.  In both cases  Im running 15 wheels.
2571,People make tabletop games from many motivations. Some professionals and corporations just keep making them because that is their profession. Others use the medium as artistic expression. These are not always the same.
2572,Personally  even though I can see the benefits of the former (getting more people into the hobby with worlds they're familiar with)  I prefer new stuff when running or playing a game. I like every player to experience the same sense of novelty when diving into a new setting/world. Some of them knowing all or most of the answers to key elements of the world is a big hindrance to exploring the world naturally imo.  What do you think?
2573,Personally  I think Odyssey is the worst of the three new ACs. I liked Origins very much but Odyssey was just a boring slog and I dropped it after half of the story. Too bad you started with this entry  Origins would have been better imo.
2574,Personally  if I was into track days but didn't want a dedicated track day car  just tracking my daily driver  Id get something like Civic Type R with FWD  - FWD is safer to drive at the limit at the track. Too much throttle and you plow  which is fixed by reducing throttle. For lift off oversteer  once you get used to just hammering the throttle to fix it  you stop being scared of it and you can drive fast safely. More confidence = faster lap times  if those mean anything to you.   - Tire management is easier. Rear tires on FWD car really don't do much  even under braking. When your fronts are worn  you can do the rotation and basically get a fresh set of rubber for driving and cornering with slightly less rear grip  which is a plus cause it helps the car rotate. With RWD  a) some cars don't run square setups  and b) those that do end up getting less traction overall since a worn rear isn't as good at braking on the front.   - At a certain speed/power level  if you are not breaking traction  you don't really get any advantage of RWD.   That being said  for street driving purely  I would not touch FWD with a 10 foot pole. Wet or snow handling is abysmal  and random things like accelerating hard from a 90 degree right at a stop light just feels so bad.
2575,Personally I loved  Monochrome city from koikimo(love is an understatement)  Gotoubun no kimochi from 5toubun no hanayome  Ai no supreme(kobayashi-san)  And the ops/ ed from boku no hero season 5  Horimiya op.  (Ill edit this when I remember them xD)
2576,Personally I loved it.  My tastes in RPGs tend to be Skyrim  Witcher 3  Divinity  that sort of thing.  Odyssey is not at all like most of the other AC games  which I was glad about.  I've played some of Origins  but honestly  for me so much of a good RPG is about the setting and the places you visit and I just found Egypt to be mostly boring desolate ruins.  Greece  though  was beautiful and vibrant and interesting.  The story was well told and I was never bored which is amazing for an rpg of that length.
2577,Personally waiting for the non-notch screen. No reason to upgrade from a 12pro right now. S models in general have become moot the last couple of years. Hope they keep the current square design for model 14
2578,Personal-only is a great away to get rid of potential reach  because people don't want their timeline filled with nonsense.  I unfollowed many interesting devs/games because they spammed my timeline with political  gender  cartoon porn or representation crap.  There is not a single reason against having both  a personal and a branded account. Tools nowadays let you manage them with ease(no need to log out) and you can even schedule tweets/automate retweets(like your personal account retweeting your branded one).  Just don't
2579,Peugeot 406 coupe by pininfarina. Still is a stunning piece of design on humble underpinnings  if you want a comparison just look at the awkward and ungainly 407 coupe that replaced it. Available in the UK for a few hundred quid. I doubt the best ones in the country break 3k. I would have added the fiat coupe but its an interesting design and cool  especially 20 years later but it's not beautiful.
2580,Pfft  web development is nothing compared to game development! Trust me when I say I have done both and I even co-developed ERP systems which are one of the most complex software as people say.  As a developer  when jumping to game development you'd find yourself in square one all over again. The good news is that it is always the same as you've been through before  overwhelming at first then it will get easier with time and patience.
2581,Phantasy Star 4 is not episodic  but it's short  and has a brisk-paced story with clear navigation.  If at any point you forgot what's going on  you can talk to your party members in the menu to get specific directions. The game does a good job of making it feel like something actually happens each hour of playing  since the main plot has no downtime for errands or fetchquests  and your next destination is never far off.    Just make sure to keep a wiki tab open for the spell descriptions.  Those aren't in-game.    Deltarune mostly fits.  The first chapter is about 4 hours.  The second is about 6.  The navigation is very linear  and the plots are simple. You don't have to bust out a spiderweb chart to figure out who's related to who  etc.    The first two chapters are being out now as a free demo  and chapters 3-5 will be paid releases.
2582,Planescape: Torment and Icewind Dale are pretty universally respected. Neverwinter Nights 1+2 and Gothic 1+2  but I don't know if that is personal bias.  Titles that probably shouldn't be included  but would be on my list  are Mount and Blade  S.T.A.L.K.E.R  Borderlands  but those are mostly other genres with RPG elements.
2583,"Play DQXI with the ""stronger monsters"" and ""exp limiter"" Draconian Quests enabled. Each time you think you've finally escaped the difficulty curve a new enemy or boss will show up to beat your ass and humble you. It does maybe get somewhat easier in the very very lategame  but it's not like enemies turn into complete pushovers either.  One of the reasons I recommend everyone play the game this way is that it actually addresses that obsolete crafting problem you mention. On normal  there's almost no reason to actually bother with all the alchemy and upgrading and treasure-hunting because even without all that gear you still completely faceroll the game. But on hard mode  you are combing every square inch of every map and town  going for perfect upgrades on the forge  doing absolutely everything you can just to try and get some kind of edge and even the odds against the brutal enemies you're facing. And the world design being so rich and detailed goes perfectly with this  the player is now heavily incentivized to engage with it but engaging with it is itself a highly enjoyable experience."
2584,Play Path of Exile.  It's free and it's really the best ARPG experience you're going to get right now.  There are others  but on the whole  PoE beats the field unless you're looking for something very specific that another game does.  To illustrate  they run quarterly leagues and each serves as an expansion adding new content to the game while keeping old content that players liked and axing stuff players didn't enjoy.  To illustrate the scope  they've hit the point where they have to start excluding mechanics from leagues purely because of how many they have.
2585,Play Shin Megami Tensei  Jrpg where you build a team of monsters and fight with them  battle system is based heavily around buffs  you have to learn how to use the battle system properly to progress  but thats not as limiting as it sounds  it actually makes it a real fun challenge. Do yourself the faaaaavooooour
2586,Played a ton of 2e AD&D  played some WOTC D&D and just do not like them. Way too warm and fuzzy   not enough crunch   not enough interesting options.     Play a lot of Hackmaster 5e  and DCC for quick pickup games.
2587,Played it alot back then on pc when there was 5 discs. Finally finished it this week. Everything in this game is a 10 except for gameplay. It aged badly. Limited ways to heal  having to rest to recover hp/spells  getting disrupted during said sleep by strong enemies  quick loading 50 times an hour.  I'd recommend it on easy. The game is beautiful and deserves to be seen.
2588,Players knowing key elements of the world can be an advantage too. After all  their characters would know about the world they live in - players having some of that knowledge too can make everything a lot smoother and more believable. I don't want a worldbuilding detail to be a shock twist out-of-character if it would be everyday knowledge in-character - but likewise it works the other direction where if something is a shock revelation to my character  I want it to be a bit of a surprise to me too. There are pros and cons to any playstyle. I pretty much exclusively GM in homebrew or at least semi-homebrew settings but I can understand the appeal of playing in a world you know and love from media.
2589,Playing Morrowind rented from the video store during school holidays was absolutely incredible but ultimately getting FFVII off my cousin to play on the PS1 fully got me into gaming generally. FF 7-10 has to be my favourite run of games  then Witcher 1-2  I couldn't really get into 3 which still feels bizarre because I was so excited to play. Then Fallout 3  New Vegas  Oblivion and then Skyrim got me into modding and I genuinely can't believe how much Fallout 4 sucked. But if anyone can explain why I hated Fallout 4 and the Witcher 3 so much after being a huge fan of preceding games I would love some answers.
2590,Playing need for speed and I saw this really crazy looking car with amazing proportions  the SLS AMG so I began googling it and came across a show called top gear for the first time where Jeremy Clarkson reviewed the sls and called it a perfect car.   From there my interest in cars took off and now here I am working for Audi  Mazda and Kia. I also keep a model of a SLS AMG at my desk at work to remind myself where it all started.
2591,Please help. Bought a car almost two years ago and shortly after I realized the [decal](https://www.etsy.com/listing/830339185/stick-figure-family-car-decal-sticker) on the back windshield wasn't a sticker  but is actually etched into the glass... after almost 2 years of buying stickers to cover it I'm becoming more and more frustrated.   Is there any way to get this decal removed without having to replace the entire back windshield? Thank you in advance...

2595,Post game. NG+ usually sucks. I liked it in CT but usually its just playing the exact same game with powered up characters. It can be a little boring for most games.  I like it in stuff like Dark Souls where the challenge is retained but thats not usually how its handled.
2596,"Post starts ""the older I get"" then mentions ""college life"" - age is relative  I have to re examine my own preconceptions here.      As a guy who is old to some  young to others  I agree with you fully. I like long single games  but I diverge from you in that I do MMO more than singleplayer. I currently play 1 MMO almost all my gaming time. If it kills time and satisfies my craving for gaming and steady progress  why bother branching out  until it doesn't? Life is easy  when I'm easy to please."

2598,President Aria  President Maa  and President Hime from the Aria series. I don't know why  but I love these three. They're so goofy.   Pikachu from Pokemon is also a no-brainer for me.  Some of my other favourites:  * Black Hayate (and Den) from Fullmetal Alchemist  * Kirara from InuYasha  * Hamtaro
2599,Pretty common issue for 4Runners and a few other cars. The solution is to blow air through the lines connecting to the charcoal canister filter but the quick fix is to pull the pump nozzle out half an inch and angle the nozzle to let more air escape. Youll probably notice it only happens at certain gas stations as well
2600,"Pretty much anything from KOEI  especially the Warrior titles. Mindless hack n' slash but really fun  if you're into it. I used them for years as ""relaxation"" while watching or listening to stuff on YouTube."
2601,"Pretty much every Acura made in the last 15 years is mediocre  mid-luxury Japanese ""meh"" that's a step below anything the Germans or Toyota make so I'm not expecting much good to come out of this besides whatever good they can squeeze out of the Civic. Looking forward to being surprised."
2602,Pretty much nobody wants a 2-door FWD coupe. Thats why the entire market has pretty much dried up. In the 90s  everyone had a couple now theyre gone. The last holdout was the Honda Civic but even that has gotten the axe.
2603,Pretty much rn is a great time for cars to increase in value. Bought a rough sc400 for 300 at beginning of covid  sold for 3000. Bought a 89 f150 for 1500  sold a week later for 4000. Bought a NA8 for 1400 non runner 3 or 3 months back and I have tons of people trying to buy or trade for it. People offering b swapped crxs  rsx type Ss. This market is prime real estate.
2604,Pretty standard episode 2 of a TCG anime. Give a full duel/fight while taking the training wheels off a tad and shows a little bit more in depth mechanics of the game.   Hiyori is gonna be a love or hate character I can already tell. Her whole character arc is gonna be taking risk and not caring about the outcome while she plays.   Also the opening slaps.
2605,"Pretty sure the three ""parents"" want to die and Gus took his turn this episode. I think Blood is going to take his turn during the trial battle  but Gus now knows if the kid wins it'll destroy him  so he's asking him to give up."
2606,Probably a good thing. We have plenty of open world games  Metroid can stay true to form. I love open world games such as fallout  Skyrim  and Far Cry  but I dont think we need a Metroid skinned version of those.
2607,Probably better off hiring professional actors for this. It's cheaper than you'd think it is.  Lots of professional actors pick up side work from Los Angeles craigslist postings. Might want to post there.
2608,Probably just a supercharger (plus requisite ECU tuning) and modern tires for the C4. Maybe not equal to something like a 720S in terms of specs  but certainly close enough for a skilled driver to believably show up a cocky opponent.
2609,Probably not as much as many but might get there one day. I got a 04 VW R32 11 years ago and it's been slowly going up for the last few years. It's mainly desirable in the VW community  people sell and rebuy them constantly because they loved it so much. Also interesting seeing people's garages with high end Porsches or Ferraris next to their R32s. The 08 are much cheaper and even the 2012 Rs are starting to get that way.  I don't have a ton of driving experience behind a lot of different cars but I always have a blast driving it so I don't see ever selling it. If I did I'd probably get 5k-8k more than I paid.
2610,Proportionality is justice. Igarashi could stand to be a bit bigger without going full #OppaiLoli. Sakurai looks just right. No one is ever going to look proportional next to Takeda. He deserves a break too  though. Imagine buying clothes in whatever size he is. That would suck.   Props to Sakurai for taking the initiative and inviting Kazama. That's refreshing.
2611,Put events in between the traveling that doesn't feel like interruptions. So something that feeds into the broader narrative.  If they don't feed into the narrative they can end up feeling like something that is meant to be dealt with quickly because its just a static roadblock that is keeping you from arriving at your destination.
2612,Put on some Adele. Sit in front of the title transfer office and cry for 30 mins. Then once you have no more tears  chuck your keys at the new owner  and climb into your new car and realize how many things arent broken. Its a silver lining.
2613,PWM controllers are cheaper  and although less efficient overall  they spread the waste heat all over the backlight instead of concentrating it in the voltage regulation circuitry  which would probably require some sort of heatsinking.
2614,QA / game tester does not require more than a high school diploma.  It can also be hard to switch from QA to other roles. Is QA what you really want? If you are thinking of QA as a stepping stone to some other job  reconsider.  >  I like to do only PC graphics/visual communication and I don't like drawing.  It sounds like you want to go into UX (User Experience). This is a whole field  and it exists both within the game industry and outside it. This means you have options to continue doing UX if you do not like working in the game industry. You dont necessarily need a college degree to do UX  but you will be expected to have solid foundations in communication (including writing skills  as well as in-person communication)  graphics design  and it helps if you can dabble in programming a little bit. College is a good place to pick up most of these skills.  I would be skeptical of getting a master's degree  at least for now. If you are thinking of grad school as a way to get into industry  I strongly suggest getting into industry first  and going to grad school later. This way  you have a much stronger context for grad school  clearer goals  and you have a better idea of what youre going to do once you leave grad school. Ask people in industry about grad school and see what they recommend.  This isnt universal advicesome fields more or less require a masters degree  or even a PhD  but game development doesn't have many jobs like that.
2615,Quite frankly  the G35 was a good car  and if I were to be blasphemous  the Infiniti Skylines (G35  G37  Q50/60) were the best Skylines ever at being an compact luxury car.   &#x200B;  Like  ignore the GTR for a minute - after all  the GTR was a vanishingly rare top trim that comprised of maybe 2% of all Skylines? The R33 and R34 Skylines were just mediocre cars - I've ridden in them in Hong Kong (the R34 I believe was somewhat popular there)  and those cars were far behind the BMWs of the time.  &#x200B;  As an actual family car  the R34 was probably closer to the Catera than the 3 series. The G35 was the first time when I think the Skyline actually brought the fight to the Germans. I can genuinely make a case that the G37 is as good as the E90.   &#x200B;  Of course  anything is better than the current Skyline. Nissan tried selling the Skyline with an Infiniti badge in Japan  which didn't work  since well  nobody knows Infiniti there. Because sales were so bad  Nissan grafted the Maxima front end to the q50  and created this unholy abomination as the current Skyline: [https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/e/e2/Nissan\_SKYLINE\_400R\_%285BA-RV37%29\_front.jpg/1280px-Nissan\_SKYLINE\_400R\_%285BA-RV37%29\_front.jpg](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/e/e2/Nissan_SKYLINE_400R_%285BA-RV37%29_front.jpg/1280px-Nissan_SKYLINE_400R_%285BA-RV37%29_front.jpg)
2616,r/overclocking noticed this issue back when Windows 11 was first leaked  evidenced in extremely bad Aida64 memory and cache latency benchmark scores that couldn't be explained by bad settings alone. Surprised Microsoft/AMD let it continue in the full release. Given Ryzen is already penalized in latency for many applications due to the chiplet design  this must hurt quite a bit. The whole point of the large L3 cache is to mitigate the memory access penalty of Infinity Fabric. I'm sure AMD and Microsoft are working to get this fixed ASAP.
2617,r/projectcar and r/cartalk are other car related subreddits that are pretty active and have a little bit more focus on personal projects. What Id recommend  if youre browsing through online car-related resources  is to find the owner forums for cars that you own or are interested in owning  theres usually a little bit more technical discourse on those.  As for getting into local car communities  there are a few avenues. Most of my friends who got into cars  developed the interest from car meets at their respective colleges. I dont really recommend this as your only exposure to car communities  because most of these people are pretty young and inexperienced. Every now and then I meet someone who knows what theyre doing and is absolutely brilliant  but for the most part theres a lot of regurgitated myths and misconceptions about cars that have been perpetuated by the internet. Where I usually end up taking my friends who wanna learn more about cars and get exposure  is the junk/salvage yards. I have them help me out while I take apart stuff  and theyll wander off and start pulling apart other things to see how everything fits together. Then Ill introduce them to some of the other regulars  which all have their personal projects that they enjoy talking about. Additionally  hanging around your local race tracks (if there are any) is a good way to meet people who are a little bit more serious about cars and proper driving. Theres probably a few local racing clubs you could try and infiltrate around you!  Best of luck!
2618,Random question  I want to start wtching this show in the background while im working on other things  but I can't find the english dub anymore. I swear season one was on crunchyroll  now its just gone
2619,Re: Kids on Bikes / Brooms  Tales From the Loop  etc - Games *about* kids are rarely good games *for* kids. Games about kids rely on perspective we have and they don't - because they're still *in* the state we're looking back on.  Play inSpectres: https://www.drivethrurpg.com/product/17891/InSpectres
2620,Re:Zero's first arc could be its own season.  Not saying that what happens is worse  the show as a whole is amazing and I highly recommend both seasons  but if you just watch that first arc  you save yourself from the emotional pain that occurs later on.
2621,Reading in-between the lines here and it looks like this is some sort of attempt at public relations and spin to hide the fact they are actually going to lose the license for FIFA. I guess putting out the same shoddy game each year is pissing off the suits at FIFA regardless of the sales and they want to protect the brand image.  Lets hope FIFA do not give it to someone worse like 2K thats the worst case scenario. Best case scenario is the Football Manger games published by SEGA get to use the FIFA name.
2622,Realizing that D&D  specifically 5e  really isn't all that good at most things  arguably even the thing it claims to be good at. It's a decent system that is punching way above its weight class because of a brilliant marketing team  a hefty advertising budget  and brand recognition.  If you strip away all that and just compare apples to apples on mechanical strengths of the system  it really doesn't offer much of anything. Poor customization options for characters  abysmal GM support  little to no content outside of combat  and top that off with incredibly uninspired combat. Once you realize there's a bunch of really great games out there that cost less on average and are just as easy or easier to learn  there's almost no reason to keep playing 5e.
2623,Really excited for these  because A78s in the Kompanio 1200 (or MT8195) should match the cache  clock speeds of the Dimensity 1200 - which scores nearly 1000 in a Geekbench 5 ST benchmark and hits 3Ghz  probably at no more than 3 watts (certainly no more than 3.5 I would think  and Im highballing deliberately).  Also included is AV1 codec support  Dolby 7.1  and a 5-core Mali GPU. If Acer nails the display and trackpad  latter of which has been an issue for my experience with Chromebooks exclusively these days (Synaptics? Google ought to work with OEMs like MS.) - then this is guaranteed to be a hit and the first really solid ARM Chromebook out there  and possibly the first *7-8/10* non-Apple ARM-based laptop in general.  I wonder how these A78s on TSMC 6NM compare to Gracemont cores on performance and power at 3Ghz. Im willing to bet Gracemont uses 1.5-2X as much power  but its probably also be able to draw even *more* power in exchange for higher absolute peak performance. Dunno but I love ARMs A7X series of cores for the PPA and PPW  and this should be an important test for the big leagues of PCs & ARM reference cores.
2624,Really glad that they managed to restore Fido. Can't forget how Episode 10 was...painful for him (and for most of us)  to put it that way. He's back to his old self it seems  his joyful self.  But at the same time...Eugene  I saw the locket  and I knew...I was just starting to like his character too. He seemed to be such a nice person having lunch with Shin and his imouto Frederica  forging some kind of bond. He also cared a lot about his own little sister. And now she'll have to face the harsh reality.
2625,Really interesting how the Wagon doesn't have any of the horrid plastic crap around the wheel arches  but the Sedan does.  Also  kind of odd how they showed the Sedan in a super dark color on that last shot of them together. It's almost like they're ashamed of their black plastic massacre they committed on the Sedan.
2626,Rec Room is a place to definitely consider - not just because of table bombs and putting daggers in other players backs  [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wekVrflUwSI](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wekVrflUwSI)  a very good analysis [https://youtu.be/\_WVqXcefLW8](https://youtu.be/_WVqXcefLW8)  &#x200B;  what a real online game looks like https://youtu.be/goLuN1eLK4k
2627,"Recently  I decided to try my hand at making smaller tech demos. Fire propagation is something that has always amused me  and it seemed like a good idea at the time.  After some research  I stumbled upon [this article](https://jflevesque.com/2012/12/06/far-cry-how-the-fire-burns-and-spreads/) by the developer of the fire propagation system for Far Cry 2. Their method does away with complex simulations  and relies on a 'simpler' system to keep the fire dynamic  performant and realistic enough for all practical purposes. However  after reading the article several times  I'm still confused by a few concepts.  The developer talks about a 2D grid that is dynamically generated for grass  and a system for tracking each cell's 'burnability' and lifetime. While I do understand the logic behind this  I'm pretty baffled by the rules for the grid generation. Let's say we have a patch  and I hit a clump of grass -- which is a 'burnable' entity -- with the flamethrower. I then generate a 2D grid around it. If that grid is evenly spaced as described in the article  it's impossible for every other clump to match it. Of course  I could always run through the grid and check which clumps it contains  but this poses extra problems.  * *Every single* clump of grass has to be a separate entity  carrying a Flammable component  which would probably be a hit in performance (although the developer outlines a few ways to mitigate that later on) * The dev talks about setting the cells *themselves* on fire  so I don't know if there's some kind of actual matching with the physical grass -- more like ""there's grass roughly around here  and the fire will encompass it"" * Whenever an entity is damaged by fire  a grid is generated on the fly. Cells that catch fire become damagers themselves. Following this system  every new cell that gets damaged will generate a new grid  I'm not sure I understand exactly what is happening here. I can appreciate the simplicity of the system  but I can't think of a way to translate this to actionable programming. I still think it's interesting enough to make  so it'd be great if I could get some insights on this."
2628,Recently  I had a kid at my work that also likes anime ask me about pairings in Naruto. I do have my preferences  but man  that's really not the type of thing that I care to talk about with other people  at least in person.
2629,Recently my laptop has been overheating even when using programs that are not very intensive  and that it used to handle just fine (i.e. the fan would barely need to start up). I've never cleaned out the fan because with the way my laptop is built  I have to remove more than a dozen tiny screws from the back cover  as well as disconnecting a bunch of things inside just so I can even *reach* the fan. I'm not a tech saavy person so I'm just not confident that I could do it without messing it up somehow. But the point is  I'm pretty sure the fan is caked in dust  leading to the overheating.  I went to a repair shop to ask about getting my laptop cleaned and possibly replacing the fan if necessary  and they said they'd need my administrator password. Is that really necessary? And how can I protect my privacy if I do have to give it? Like **what's a checklist of things you'd do before bringing it in** (deleting cookies  saving important files onto a flashdrive  etc)?
2630,re-check your front panel connectors (the ones for the power/reset switches and LEDS) .. those are easy to dislodge  and just as easy to connect to the wrong pins. so get in there with a flashlight and  mirror or whatever to make sure you have those plugged in correctly.  you only really need the power button to boot  so you can unplug the rest if you're not sure about them.     You can just leave the front panel audio/usb stuff unplugged  if you think messing with those ones is the problem.  it doesn't need those hooked up to boot.       if it was a problem with the graphics card  or connection to it  it would at least try to boot into BIOS  so i don't think that's your problem.    also check the 24-pin main power supply cable to the motherboard  make sure it's fully seated.  if it got bumped then it could cause a no-go   also make sure the switch on your power supply is on.  it's an easy thing to forget about
2631,Redo of Healer.   The obvious rape issue is the biggest. And Keyaru's harem is so obedient to him  iirc one was even his slave. That  going hand in hand with the revenge rape story  screams misogyny to me. Of course the princess was a bitch  but turns out she was actually really nice! She only needed to be completely obedient to this man!
2632,reduces mean piston speed per revolution so if that's an issue you should be able to get it to rev higher.  it also allows you to increase your rod ratio  which increases efficiency  not mpg though that too but power per fuel burned.  dwell is increased so that you maintain cylinder pressure longer into the first half of the power stroke which is where you make 80% of the power.  torque is a function of cylinder pressure times the angle at which the piston is acting on the crank.  for instance: at tdc  there's lots of pressure but you can't push the crank down because it can only go sideways so the torque is zero.  at 90 degrees you have the best angle for torque but you've lost half your pressure  so the game is to get the balance of the most pressure and the most advantageous angle on the crank.  the longer your rods are the more the pressure is front loaded in the sweep of the stroke.   but of course you get diminishing returns  so yes you could theoretically have 3 foot rods but it wouldn't be that much better than 2 foot rods  while 6 inch rods would be significantly better than 4 inch rods.  i suggest you get some technic legos to make yourself some models to illustrate the geometry in the most tangible way possible.  now the thing about this is you're not going to make more power from the gains in rod ratio while you reduce the displacement but if you are keeping your displacement the same and you reduce the stroke  you could also increase the bore  which would allow you to use bigger valves.  or you can also get a better rod ratio buy switching out the rotating assembly into a block with a taller deck.  though this does add mass to the car.  on a side note this:  >...the first half of the power stroke which is where you make 80% of the power.  torque is a function of cylinder pressure times the angle at which the piston is acting on the crank.  for instance: at tdc  there's lots of pressure but you can't push the crank down because it can only go sideways so the torque is zero.  at 90 degrees you have the best angle for torque but you've lost half your pressure   is why the oft parroted meme of a 4 cylinder being special because it always has a cylinder in its power stroke is malarkey;  the power output of a powerstroke is not flat  not even remotely!  you don't start getting smooth power delivery until you got 7 or 8 cylinders.
2633,"Released my C++ project a while back on GitHub and have been updating it since. It's for Unreal Engine 4 (and will be upgraded to UE5 eventually) and while it's not strictly a ""roguelike"" *yet* it does contain a load of useful C++ mechanics already including the less commonly found stuff like save games and multiplayer.  [https://github.com/tomlooman/ActionRoguelike](https://github.com/tomlooman/ActionRoguelike)  The project was created as a companion project for an Unreal C++ Course I built  but the source-code can be taken apart and analysed to learn from by itself too (that's how I learned most C++ when UE4 first came out...)  I intend to keep updating and adding more rogue-like style features (ideally some actual game loop  more enemies and procedural content which is super fun to build but requires more educating myself first...)  Hope you all find it useful and can learn some things from it!"

2648,Remember: it's just a car. There will always be other cars. I know how you feel. My current car evokes the same feeling  but if it were to get totalled tomorrow  I think I'd be able to move on knowing that if I really wanted to  I could buy the same car over again and do all the same stuff to it  but variety is the spice of life. Next time you're in a position to get a toy  try something else out. Nobody can take away the fun you had with your miata  but you can always make more memories is different vehicles.
2649,Reminds me of my old alienware laptop back in 2008 overheating when I put it to sleep and stuffed it in my bag. Motherboard got toast.   I don't remember if that was when dell bought them but I wonder if that issue existed since then.
2650,"Reminds me of the System-C initiative.  In reality  when you are in the corporate sector  HW teams and SW teams report into different organizations. Managing a ""co-design"" initiative is pretty much like attempting to pass the spending bill in Congress - the politics is more important than any noble engineering effort to help reduce cost of products by engineering the SW and HW in a single thread."
2651,Remove ram dimms till it works. If it doesn't replace the cost battery. If that doesn't work swap the ram out. If that doesn't remove the gpu and connect to integrated graphics. If that doesn't work swap out the cpu. Try and connect a buzzer/beeper to the speaker + - Porta on the motherboard to check for post codes.
2652,Repairable but no chance to upgrade to anything other than 4 core Intel cpus and no chance for dedicated gpus. I still dont understand why people hype this laptop so much. 80% of the stuff being advertised with this laptop can already be done/upgraded in other laptops.
2653,Replaying Gothic and Gothic 2. Has to be my favourite rpgs of all time. I played it 15 years ago on the old crt monitor and old aspect ratio  I got to the old camp and spent hours buying billets  making swords and selling them for 10ore profit just to buy the diggers pants. It has to be the most engaging and unique settings in an rpg Ive seen to date. The insane controls make it even more  immersive imo. The pacing of the story is great and the difficulty on point  that first scavenger kill fills you with joy. Yes you can cheese stuff by glitching ai etc but it's on the player to choose how to play and when you play it properly you feel that satisfaction. I have purchased at least 5modern rpgs to play  but I just can't stop playing gothic. I find my self thinking about wether I should do a mage run or paladin  strngth or dex.
2654,"Respect for canon is of great import to me. (This is somewhat ironic  as I've made immense changes to the canon of various published RPG settings--*Forgotten Realms* in particular--because I disliked where the published canon was going.)  Much like u/dsheroh  I prefer to keep my campaigns well away from firmly established characters. I'm rather more lax about events  however; for example  I wouldn't mind having the PCs participate in the Battle of Five Armies in a campaign of The One Ring  but I would have greater issue with the party running across Thorin and his group after their escape from the Woodland Realm.  That's the general rule. In a game specifically established to address questions of  ""What if...?"" then the situation is quite different  but I tend to view those as experimental or one-offs  not necessarily ""real"" campaigns that I want to follow for years."
2655,Reviewing a Taycan 4S right now for the Canadian car mag I write for. I am absolutely a purist  with just about everything else in my garage being rear-drive  manual  naturally aspirated  etc.   This thing absolutely ROCKS. It is a definite contender for an eventual daily driver  once the infrastructure thing has been sorted out more in my area.
2656,Rim size doesnt  overall diameter can though.  A 185-80-13 has about the same overall diameter as a 225-40-18 so changing 13 wheels with 18s in that case  as long as the overall diameter is about the same wont make a noticeable difference.  Now  take a truck and replace the  say  225-70-15s with 33-10.50-15s and there will be a difference.
2657,RIP  saw this coming when they were clearancing the old Paperwhite at historic low prices. I picked one up and I ain't even mad at the update  the firesale prices of the microUSB Paperwhite are half of the new Paperwhite price.    What I am waiting for is an update on their higher end Voyage/Oasis type device with physical page turn buttons. I can't believe they did an update on the Oasis and kept it at microUSB. Been putting off upgrading my Voyage waiting for USB-C on the series.
2658,"Rivian has ""delayed"" tank steer and I highly doubt it ever arrives like it was first shown. It's quite frankly more of a dangerous gimmick than anything.  I think systems like rear steering are useful. Reducing the turning radius of a truck has a lot of benefits. And rear steering systems can improve stability too. Crab walking on the Hummer EV has a pretty limited scope but it's more useful  and way less potentially dangerous  than tank steer."
2659,Role-playing is not exclusively a narrative term. It's mechanical  referring to a character's specific abilities and what they can do with them.  A stereotypical D&D party  for example  looks like this: A fighter  a cleric  a rogue  and a wizard. The fighter is a frontliner; someone to get behind if a fight breaks out. The cleric heals the party & keeps everyone alive. The rogue can pick locks & disarm traps  and maybe also resolve things through diplomacy. The wizard is a jack of all trades  solving any problems the rest of the party can't.  Those are all roles being played. Regardless of any narrative or character backstories written  everyone is fulfilling a role within the party. That's what makes it a role-playing *game*.  One of the most fundamental rules of a tabletop RPG is there's no wrong way to play one. That doesn't just mean you can tell any kind of story you want. It also means you don't need to include a narrative at all  and just play for the mechanics. I think that should apply to video games too: An RPG with in-depth world building  politics  & player choice is *just as valid* as an RPG that's nothing but combat encounters with no rhyme or reason.  I'm extremely biased on this subject because 99% of the time I only ever hear it used to gatekeep & invalidate people's opinions. But the bottom line is if it has objective  dynamic  and permanent improvement of a player's abilities over time  using raw numbers tied directly to their character(s)  it's an RPG.
2660,Roll20. You only really need audio... you can run over Skype (Skype of Cthulhu).  Its easy. Whats less easy is finding a group in a time zone you can play in.  Join roll20 and have a look at the games that have free slots.  There used to be a group on facebook that advertise games. Not bothered with facebook for a few years so not sure its still going.  There are subs on here that do similar.
2661,Rome is tricky because everything I can think of comes in a chunky system. Mythras Rome instantly comes to mind as a game that would be a no-brainer for any Romaphile TRPG fan - ***but*** which isn't good for a first time TRPG experience. You would need to know all of the mechanics really well and have premade characters for the game to go smoothly. The same applies to GURPS.  &#x200B;  **Ancient Greece is a lot easier.** There are a good few Ancient Greece TRPGs that are designed to be very lightweight and easy to pick up. One is [Mazes & Minotaurs](http://mazesandminotaurs.free.fr/revised.html) (as /u/Better_Equipment5283) mentions. Another is [Agon](https://www.drivethrurpg.com/product/328661/AGON?affiliate_id=1256684).  The former is free  while the latter has a much more professional presentation.
2662,Rpg games are for role playing a character  which in some cases fits what games that you sound like you enjoy such as Diablo Skyrim or dark souls. But remember most rpgs are about role playing a character in a specific story  these games are the most heavy story games that you can buy.
2663,Rudeus describing the prison was hilarious. No wonder he got drenched from that lady his eyes were certainly on the right thing. The immersion of the forest was so well done.  That fight was slick North Saint is no joke it's same fight style as his father so he's used to it and Fluffy boi with the assist too.  Rip Oji san just as Eris was happy remembering him gonna be sad state they gonna return to.
2664,Rudeus prison scene is pure gold  but damn seeing Sauros execution animated hits harder than in the Novel  and the way they show it right after Eris talks about him is just dirty.   Loved the episode  I'm really hyped for what's coming in the future.
2665,Rules Cyclopedia!  Unless you expect them to DMing  then no.  If you think about it  for just a minute  there weren't that many options in the early days of RP for kids  they had Bunnies and Burrows  which may intuit clearer understandings of rules (what can I do in Watership Down?)  but the rules are not actually any better presented for kids.  I'm not going to treat you like you don't have kids like everyone else  and everyone else probably started their kids on D&D. Later they probably went to Blacksand and Monster Horrorshow  but  those books often are gouged to a hundred times the cost on eBay.  Advanced Fighting Fantasy if D&D is too hard for them to DM  and they want to be in the driver's seat  not just a player in the game.  Tyvm
2666,Sadly  it's quite common  at least in the US.  I don't really recommend it as an entry point if you're not interested in the genre.  Actually  I'm not a big fan of it as an entry point even if you are  but I feel like it's a doubly bad choice if it's not a genre that appeals to you.
2667,Sadly most people have this same view  that somehow making games is easy and while it certainly can be the case with some games many games take multiple hundreds of people working full time for years to complete.  I cant tell you the number of times I've seen some utter noob come out with his idea to make an mmo all by himself or  remake gta5  or something similar.  Take 5 seconds to look at the credits and realize that's what it takes to make a game happen  and anytime you see some guy/girl solo dev a game they are usually buying assets to pad out the stuff they cant cover and just dont credit those people.  Sure there are exceptions where people do solo dev but those people are basically inhuman  godly beast with dozens of skillsets mastered to a level most people could never even hope to achieve.
2668,Safe yes.  Will it cause overtime damage? Well you are putting in Acetone  isopropanol  xylene and long-chain hydrocarbons into your engine system.  Your hoses might deteriorate at a slightly faster rate if they are not set up for high alcohol solutions.  You'll also can run more rich in your fuel systems until the cataclean lowers in concentration  but this changes based on the engine you run  often you won't see any effect.  As long as you do your regular maintenance  don't over use it; you won't see any detrimental effects that are out from ordinary wear and tear.
2669,"Same  the older I get (I'm 39)  the more I prefer long games. I'd rather spend months on a single game I _love_ than spend the same amount of time playing through 6 or 7 shorter games of varying quality. The quality/time ratio is much better with long games for however amount of time I'll spend in a year.  I also don't really like finishing games. If I love a game  and I beat it  that means it's over and there's nothing more to play. That's a bad thing. Yet another reason for longer games being my preference. Short games bug me because if I like it  I want as much as I can get  and if I don't  I won't be finishing it anyways so it doesn't matter.  It's also why I prefer difficult games. It means more time is spent with the game since you aren't blasting through it  and more time is spent really digging into the systems.  It's just always so strange seeing the common refrain of ""I'm getting older so prefer short easy games""  because for me it's the exact opposite and I have hard logic for it  where the only logic I can see for enjoying shorter games is ""more games can be beat""  but I also have hard logic for why beating games isn't a kinda negative thing  so it just leaves me flabberghasted why ""I'm older thus prefer short easy games"" is _sooooo_ common. Imo it's kind of illogical.   The only thing that makes sense to me is that people's backlogs and the pace of new releases all combined with social media have created a hostile FOMO atmosphere to where if people aren't playing _as many games as possible in as short amount of time as possible so as to experience more games_  than they feel left out and have a constant negative weight on them. That sounds like a terrible way to enjoy games tbh. Is missing out on some popular games  or not being able to play them until months later _really_ that much worse than having one game you're absolutely loving for months on end? I'd say ""no"" quite emphatically  but the gaming culture at large seems to have a very loud ""yes"" to the question. And I just don't get it."
2670,Saturday morning is the best time slot for me (the rest of the house is asleep  so I don't have to worry about interruptions  and I'm up anyway because I've always been a morning person). That's resulted in my players being from Ireland  England  and Australia. I've had fellow Americans before  but some of them literally started snoring on the voice chat...
2671,"Savage Worlds has a good number of what they call ""One Sheet"" adventures  which are free to download. Many  with a horror vibe. Even if you don't play SW they are good sources of quick adventure ideas  plots  and characters."
2672,Saw one of these on the street last weekend and was blown away. Weirdly enough  I could have sworn I heard a growl come from it as it drove away. Do these have a similar feature as the Tesla Plaid where you can load up and simulate engine noises?
2673,"Scarlet Nexus set the new bar for ARPG combat IMO. The battle system is so good  you essentially have 8 separate mini-devil triggers your party members give you that have special effects like fire/lightning  teleportation  slow-mo  invisibility  invincibility  shadow clones  and true sight that you're toggling on and off or combining with each other to fight all these different types of enemies with unique AI that require different strategies to beat. And then you've got a real devil trigger ""trance"" mode that pops automatically when the gauge fills  then *that* charges the game's Sin Devil Trigger equivalent which the player can save to activate on command. And then on top of that you've got double jump + airdash  this CRAZY psychokinesis system that lets you use physics objects as projectiles by holding down the right or left trigger  but then after you use a PK attack you can do a dashing followup attack to chase the projectile into the enemy in both ground and air so in practice you are just zipping around the battlefield swapping powers going wild. There's also a guard crush system that encourages using PK attacks and fancy moves in consecution and the crush animations are sooooo goddamn cool.   And the HIDEOUT my guy. It's the most legendary hideout of any RPG ever once you get all the party member accessories for it and see everyone doing the absolutely 10/10 special animations for them. There have to be like 200-300 unique animations between all the characters in the hideout and they just constantly shuffle creating a near-infinite variance of awesome. Also the game is extremely anime and the English VA absolutely cannot handle it so you definitely wanna play in JP because the original voices are actually all really good  every character is cast pretty much perfectly and they give some killer performances.  For an indie ARPG though I absolutely stan Anima: Gate of Memories. Game is the shit  it's like a fusion of Castlevania  Nier  Demon's Souls  and DMC. This was probably my favorite ARPG combat before Scarlet Nexus came out but the combat is still extremely unique because it involves transforming between two different characters actively during combos. And you build the characters out with their own equipment  skill tree  and fully customizable movesets. Like there is ""jump"" and ""attack"" and ""switch"" bound permanently to the controller and then all the other buttons Y  B  L1  L2  R2 can have whatever moves you unlock in the skill tree assigned to them  but they also have separate binds for whether the button is being pressed in neutral or during a combo chain  so you can have even more moves available to you at once. But then even that is actually x2 because of the two characters. You can build the guy as an aggressive melee fighter with close-range and distance-closing moves  then the girl as an extremely powerful projectile-spamming mage. And the game is actually pretty hard and requires you to master the switching mechanic. It's actu"
2674,Scotty Kilmer is a horrible rambling lunatic  anyway those fluids in your vehicle should be in excellent shape after such a short time. I may consider a brake fluid change when my pads are needing replacing just so I dont push old heat cycled fluid back into the lines from my calipers when I compress them to install new pads. I wouldnt even consider changing coolant for at least the first 5-7 years  even then I would only change it if I was bored and wanted to be nice to the car.
2675,Scum and Villainy is a Forged in the Dark game (Blades in the Dark hack) and the three types of Ship/Crew fit the archetypical Sci Fi travelers - Smuggers  Bounty Hunters and Rebels. It focuses more on Space Opera tropes which I think helps a lot with goofier Sci Fi  so its inspirations are Firefly  Cowboy Bebop and Star Wars.  It is my favorite RPG since I just love the style of improv to get past obstacles.
2676,Sea of stars and chained echoes are on my list too. Eyuden chronicle is gonna take more time unfortunately.  Rise of Third Power looks really cool  from Arafell developers.   Weird West  from ex Arkane devs.  Other than that  not sure.
2677,Seasonal campaigns. Aim for a good arc over 2-4 months or even shorter. Use zero sessions to lay ground rules and character progression. Thats how Ive been doing most of my games. I also typically run an unusual one shot for my birthday  like GUMSHOE or my Homebrew this year. I also have a large potential play group and players will run their own games on my discord. Youre not doing anything wrong  but if youre burning investment of players  there are steps to doing things better. If the players want something else  encourage them to run those games themselves  being supportive with resources and guidance along the way.
2678,Second episode  still awesome so far. Less interaction with the three undead  but more action and mystery.  The one about choosing one god reminds me of D&D setting. I wonder why the anime is called as paladin. Paladin is usually a warrior devoted to one god and use some divine power. But in this world  everyone is devoted to one god  even warrior like Blood.
2679,Seemed like the first G35 was everywhere during the 2000s. Certainly eclipsed the contemporary Lexus IS300 (which I had). That was probably the start of the Golden Age for the Infiniti brand  peaking with the second gen G35/37 then plunging downhill into the toilet when the whole Q debacle started.
2680,Seems like a practical and good value daily.  In terms of styling  especially front facia and trim  I somewhat prefer the CX-5  but it beat the RAV4 by a wide margin.    And wow  good thing you went with the third-gen.  I just looked at the [fourth-gen Outlander](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/9/92/2022_Mitsubishi_Outlander_SE_Launch_Edition_%28United_States%29_front_view_03.jpg) and I'm shocked by how bloated and garish it looks.
2681,"Seems like an opportunity to get something different in the future.  Yeah  this one's nice  but what's the next one going to be?   How many cars are out there  and how long are you going to live?   If you have one car forever  aren't you going to be missing out on a variety of experiences?  Time is right to sell and in the future there will be something different.  Reminds me of a song I heard recently:  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w2zswtxW5X4  ""Money cant buy back that 64 Falcon that you sold in your 20s and then regretted it was gone because you thought it contained some meaning or some answers to a life that you never bothered to question or even take a good close look at""    ""Why do you always feel so empty in spite of all you have were those feelings you remember even real and were they honestly about some junky old Falcon or any other thing that you could own """
2682,Seems like BS to me.  CrossClimate 2s are just a premium All-Season tire  they definitely don't grip so much that they'd cause problems. (not that this problem would happen from excess grip anyway)   The mechanic probably just trying cover for a botched/rushed install  or failure to balance & align the tires when they installed them. Worst part is  they think your friend will fall for it. Make them fix it at no cost to her.
2683,Seems like the gasket between the throttle and intake has failed. after 10 years  I wouldn't be surprised if it happened to be honest  since it is rubber. but given how fucking tight that engine bay is  those parts were almost surely removed when it was disassembled for the valve stem seals. Must have put the throttle body on wrong or not used a new gasket or whatever.  Do with this information what you will.
2684,Seems like the Tesla Stans and FanBoi's are slipping. I wonder what will happen to the TSLA stock if that continues   I'm sure the Tesla Service Center experience for warranty work has nothing to do with it?
2685,Seems really stupid to time their releases the be exactly behind cpu update schedules. They did it last year with Zen 3 and they're about to do it again with ADL. Wouldn't it make sense to just adjust their release schedule?
2686,"Self taught includes a huge range of developers  from ""did one Unity tutorial"" to the equivalent ability of an industry veteran. Rather than making a sweeping generalization  I'll list a few things that may show up in game development that a more traditional CS education would help with.  In very vague order of importance:  - **Data structures and algorithms ** especially when it comes to optimization. A CS background will give you better intuition for where performance bottlenecks will come from and how to fix them.  - **Object oriented programming.** Engines like Unity encourage OOP  but the tendency for new programmers is not to utilize it fully.  - **Version control and code styling.** CS courses usually cover version control and best practices that make working on teams smoother that a self-taught dev might not get.  - **Networking.** This is an absolute monster that is tough for multiplayer games. There are a lot of third-party packages that try to abstract out the hard stuff but a CS background definitely helps here.  Obviously none of these things are impossible to learn yourself  but having a formal education might give you a leg up and not require pausing development to do a bunch of research. Also  none of them are language/engine specific  to your questions original point.  Source: CE major"
2687,Self-learning game development here. I see a lot of discussion about if its possible and not much about strategy.  Define clearly what you are learning  and research deeply whether it is an appropriate tool for the task at hand. This is how you avoid getting stuck or wasting time. Look at everything as art  everyone as artists  and approach every tool as you would a simple pencil. If it's meant to be used as a tool by humans  ability is a more trivial factor than folks are willing to admit.  How do you learn? Some people like the videos  but personally I think it's best to get as close to source of the tool as possible. Manuals  documentation  and references must be what the pros use because who knows better than the people who built the tool? I just can't trust tutorial mindsets that think the contrary.    For me  it's cold reading documentation and API references  and staring at source code. I haven't found any shortcuts so far. If I don't understand a term or method  I either figure it out in context  reference another document  or table it until it trips me up in practice. *The table of contents and conclusion is often worth the entire document  because it *is* the entire document.*  I have two college degrees  and have never taken a CS course. I would definitely be better off if I had the above advice  and skipped school. My colleges in particular screwed me because I graduated with high GPAs and an empty portfolio. Do not let gatekeepers intimidate you. Push what you don't know  dream  and blow our minds by building the things we can't imagine you can build.   We don't know what you don't know.
2688,Sell it at a gain before things change. Focus on paying off your debts  the  save up a 3 month reserve of cash (you can park it in AAPL in a margin account but don't use margin).  Once you reach this level  then you can consider buying stuff again... if something bad happened with work you still have the stocks to fall back on and can even pull out some money to your account with margin if you know you can pay it back with in 2 weeks.
2689,Seriously can't go wrong here. Literally every game here is amazing. Radiant Historia and FFIV should be much shorter than the rest. Trails in the Sky FC is short as well  but you'll want to play SC immediately after. Also I heavily recommend to play Trails of Cold Steel only after finishing Trails in the Sky Trilogy  Trails from Zero and Trails to Azure. Dragon Quest  Persona and Cold Steel can take up to 80 Hours.
2690,Setting originality is not a factor for me when choosing games. What I'm interested in are mechanics that create the themes intended by the designers. I suspect Avatar Legends is such a game  and I know Blades in the Dark is.
2691,Settlements. No 3D fps here. You can pause game and set game speed and basically you are setting tasks for your people to get on and do. You passively upgrade your settlement(s) and your people by setting them these tasks. Some you will set as warriors to go out scouting looking for stuff and/or trouble. Either way you sit and wait whilst things are done. There is a growing threat in the game but some fair warning is given and you can offset it to a degree. Basic to look at but much going on under the hood.
2692,Shadowrun 2nd Edition turns into a vampire game - sure those are just elf ears.   Rifts has a whole book on Vampires get both versions  If any of the party is from Kaeramikos or Glantri  in BECMI / Rules Cyclopedia D&D then I guarantee they know a Vampire  Nosferatu  or a Litch.  Hell it most likely their cousin or uncle / aunt.   At least 2 Princes in Glantri are suspected of being undead of some type.   It could be worse.  Minrothad Islands they have Silver Purges so often the Elves make it a holiday.
2693,She's arguably the best CEO in tech right now. Under her guidance AMD went form being on the ropes to being a serious threat to Intel.  She's got both impressive technical and business skills. Generally when you have a CEO that understands the tech that's when the magic happens.
2694,Shin with his Reiginleif decimating Legion. His unit seems as flimsy as the repubblic one  but at least seems to have better sensors and better engine.  It seems an insanely difficult design to pull of in combat. One wrong move and the unit likely has enough momentum to break its own legs. The Giad's soldiers REALLY don't like the new direction of those unit of putting offense above pilot safety.
2695,Shin's infamous zero-point failure!  And FIDO being alive is probably not much of a surprise  considering the OP itself spoiled that fact (carrying Frederica on top too).  And Eugene. Man  that was much more gruesome than what I imagined reading the LNs
2696,Short answer: anything can be made to go as fast as anything else if you spend enough time  and enough compromise.   What you need to understand is a car is nothing more than a box of metal we give meaning to. With enough work you can put any sort of engine in that box  give it any sort of modification to make it handle better  or change anything in the interior to be whatever you need. The main question with a lot of it is whether its worth the effort - but to many people it absolutely is  because theres something about the shape  or the brand or the culture around the car  that inspires them like nothing else will.  Just to make you understand  Ive got a dream to one day take a car from the 80s and modify it until its got close to properly built racing car performance. Now this will require chopping off both ends and completely redoing the suspension  potentially replacing the engine if I feel the standard engine cant be tuned enough  and even then Ill be hindered by some of the basic engineering choices if I want to keep even a shred of what the car once was. But I 100% believe that its possible to take that car from the 80s and make it into something faster around most tracks than 99% of cars sold today.
2697,Should carbon tax the shit out of these companies and see if they want to wait until 2050. Sure they can pass on tax to the consumers  but sooner or later they will not be as competitive as another company that is carbon neutral.
2698,"Sigh  to inexperienced viewers who might search up ""Vetroo V5 review"" on YouTube  the lack of testing breadth might turn them away from an otherwise fantastic cooler. Since all GN has tested in the budget cooler space is this and the NH-U12S  it'll be on the bottom of every chart until they test more coolers.  Based on other reviewers  it should be a chart-topper when compared to the regular single towers like the H212 and the Deepcool Gammaxx variations."
2699,SighI thought Giad had a much better grip of the fightings against Legions than this. Poor Eugene. It looks like from this episode that Giad may have taken back certain territories but they seems to be mostly in retreat. At least their military seems more competent than those fools at San Magnolia where they rely on Eighty Six to clear up everything for them without even considering them as human.  Also them establishing a memorial for the Eighty Six is a nice touch  any military with the basic amount of respect to other things would have done so (and many do on this Earth). While Im still somewhat skeptical on the reason behind Giads premium treatment of the Eighty Six other than for them to help with their new weapons development  todays episode do clear up part of my suspicions on them. The appearance of cute little Frederica on the fronts further extent my positive feelings on them  although its controversial enough for a young girl like her to be sent (even voluntarily) to the front lines facing death every day. She really does enough to heal the psychological wounds on Shin and his mates for them to put themselves back on the front lines.    What a huge shame for Eugene to go out like that  even if he volunteered for this job. I wonder if Shin would meet Nina in the future  this is too much of a flesh opening for either to bear and the fact that Shin had to give out the final shot threatens to make this matter even worse. I sincerely hope that Nina would never know about the true final moments of her brother.  As always A-1 Pictures have been turning up first rate animations for this very well-received series  especially in the Legion battle today. Keep up the good work and I hope that our Eighty Six mates would ultimately meet back with Lena in the future  this is the least of which Shin and others should have gotten!
2700,Silhouette system that us used for the settings of Heavy Gear and Jovian Chronicles by Dream Pod 9.  There is a lot of sci fi rpgs out there though that dont use magic and are fun to play. Not sure what genre you want other than that though?
2701,Silverfall is... a game. You have companions with interesting personalities  a conflict where you have to take a side  and okay combat.   I didn't finish Silverfall  so I guess it wasn't that great  but I remember it fondly.
2702,Simpler way: Get familiar with one or more hardware-accelerated 3D APIs (Direct3D on Windows  Metal on MacOS  OpenGL and Vulkan are cross-platform  OpenGL ES on mobile).  Old school/unnecessarily complex way: Brush up on several areas of mathematics and write a software rasterizer. I've got a [1200 page book](https://www.amazon.com/Tricks-Programming-Gurus-Advanced-Graphics-Rasterization/dp/0672318350) that can teach you to do that.
2703,Simply put D&D never quite felt right for me. I enjoyed it and played some fun campaigns but I always wanted something less based on hitpoints and more based on anatomy. It sounds weird but my first system I created after DND meant a penalty if you lost 1/4 of your HP at once and was often fatal if you lost 1/2 at once.  Then I got rid of the HP and only focused on injuries occuring  each making it easier for you to be fatally injured.  These days I wanna play every RPG once and I have an RPG club. It is weird because I'm a system tourist and each system is people talking shit about D&D and how much better that system is but as somebody who hops around I appreciate 'em all. I honestly think no system does 'big monster encounter' as well as DND with its big hitpoints pool and stuff.
2704,Since Cyberpunk is complete garbage and Avowed/Starfield are still years away; I'm thinking about getting into some retro early 2000s RPGs but the problem is their steep learning curve and outright hostility towards newbies. I've already tried other RPGs of that era such as System Shock 2 and Deus Ex 2 (I think) but didn't like either because they feel so antiquated and downright unplayable compared to what I've been used to.  The thing is; I'm spoiled rotten by modern 'watered down' RPGs like Fallout 3/NV/4  Skyrim  The Outer Worlds  Mass Effect 2/3 etc. and the most difficult RPG that I actually managed to finish is the classic Mass Effect 1.  My question is; do you think it's worth the 'investment'? I'm thinking about getting the GOG version which I heard is pretty bug free but it costs $20 which seems kind of steep for what it is.   Thanks!
2705,Since I was a little kid. At a very young age I was pointing out cars whenever we were out driving. I remembered what they were when I saw them  and would then point out when I saw another one like it  and on and on.
2706,Since it sounds like your story will be Cannonball-related (whether intentionally or not)  a few things I thought I'd share:  The current cannonball record of a bit under 30 hours had the drivers averaging a bit over 100 mph.  You don't need a special car to roll at 100ish mph for a few thousand miles.  The cannonball really more comes down to planning/ logistics and luck more than the exact performance of the car being used.  Common techniques include:  * Car-- often a high performance trim of a large luxury sedan.  Nothing too flashy-- or  modified to make it look less flashy.  Large supplemental fuel tank in the trunk to minimize fuel stops. * Team: two drivers taking turns in the front seats  sometimes a third person in the back handling documentation and some logistical and communication support. * Planning: timing the attempt for minimal traffic  minimal road work  and clear weather. * Police avoidance: radar detectors  crowdsourced apps (Waze)   police scanners  scouts along route.  People are always getting creative with interesting methods here  with mixed levels of success.    Note that this is all highly controversial in the car community.  Cannonballing is fun to think about and interesting to read about  but it's hard to condone very sleep-deprived drivers street racing on public highways alongside other unsuspecting drivers.
2707,Since its a big investment for unity and unity works on basically all platforms  i hope we can see this software being used on all platforms in games etc  i just hope it wont go away as a working software as many people use it to work now with wfh situations
2708,Since Ive owned them  the bmws before the massive grille. Pretty much all of them look great. The E46 and E92 are both very good deals still even with low miles The E46 imo is starting to show some rise in price and may become a new classic.   I feel like I saw this on a yt video at some time in the past. Maybe donut media made a video on it ?
2709,Since March 22nd of this year I've been running a regular game of Pathfinder with very few completely missed weeks  and even a few extra sessions during the weekday. It's without a doubt the longest game I've ever run in my entire life. It might even be the longest game I've ever played  for that matter. Part of that is down to running the Iron Gods module  albeit in Pathfinder 2e. It gives me structure that lets me keep going without feeling like I have no idea what I'm going to do next.  But I'm starting to feel like I'm losing steam. Only one player is really *invested* in the game  and she absolutely hates Pathfinder 2e  and she hates the module as well. She's got good reasons  too  though most of what she hates I'm content ignoring or doesn't bother me. But she's at the end of her rope with the frustrations  and doesn't want to keep playing if the module continues to be a lot of dungeon crawling and enemies that can't or won't be reasoned with and no real engagement with the player characters or their personalities.   There are three other players  but none of them seem all that interested. They don't come up with elaborate backstory and setting for their characters (though one has written a few vignettes about his character)  they don't talk about the game when the game isn't on  unless they're prompted to  they don't really engage with the game other than taking their turns in combat or occasionally making sarcastic comments that tell me they are paying attention  even if they let the other player take the lead.   The tl;dr: I feel like I'm running a game for only one of my players  but that player doesn't really like the game. What should I do? Veering away from the module seems like it would break my rhythm  but starting a new game without a module might also do that.
2710,Since no one in comments reads the article:  >While Konami itself is apparently handlingnew games for Castlevania  Metal Gear Solid  and Silent Hill  this contest seems to allow some of its lesser-known or more cult favourite series to re-emerge through different means.  All I have to say is  Suikoden 6 when?
2711,Since no one is actually answering the question (since theyre so busy telling what OP should have at their table):  VoiceMod is what I use when I need a truly unique sounding voice. It has a free version with rotating voice selections to use. Getting the paid version allows for full access of the choices as well as a mixer I believe. It works with Discord  most importantly. Any of those selections (especially the more low-fi ones) would work perfectly.  I havent used it much  I only got it when I needed to voice a Magos Dominus for a Dark Heresy game or sounding like a guy doing a recording. But it works perfectly provided your equipment/Internet is stable.
2712,Since Remedy owns the IP  and not Microsoft this very well could be a multiplatform game  however if they made an exclusivity deal with XBOX  this could be the turning point for many-many PlayStation owners  including me..
2713,Since you said its a skyactive mazda  let me say  mine gets to operating temperature in less than 2km  Granted  its a turbo  but this is without letting it run for any sort of extended period of time or anything
2714,"Since you're playing as world leaders/countries  I'm not sure that the era is all that important (except that maybe you're trying to piggyback onto 1980s Cold-War mood). It's hard to tell what gameplay would even be like. Is the emphasis more on parallel play (developing your own country) or PVP (competing against other players) or cooperative (all players are aligned and working against the NPGs)? Please don't say ""you can do all three"" because if your system doesn't have a focus  you can't even adequately describe it to people  much less sell it to people.  But the point of your post was to ask about the era  so I'll just say I think it's a great era to mine  but if you're playing in an AU 80s  people are going to want to know what's different. Was the great war in the 1950s a nuclear exchange? Was it between countries we know  or was that world different too? What is it about the game that is specific to the 1980s  versus  say the 1970s or 1990s?"
2715,Single character  so not quite what you're after  but Geneforge still had one of the best pet/ summoning systems I've come across. The first game was recently remade as well.   Basically  you're the pet class / wizard and the summons will fill the other party roles.
2716,Slightly off topic  but literally the first time I stepped into a lobby waiting for the campaign to start  a guy just casually says on game chat: Ill be the n****r. It just blew me away how someone could talk like that so calmly to strangers. I immediately left.  Other than that the game was fun.
2717,Slightly off topic but try running 3-shot games soon if you can. One shots are a perfect start but a good skill to build is carrying a story and characters through a few sessions  to learn how to build hooks and grow a story.    3 sessions is not much harder than one but its a great way to have to think about the next session with minimal pressure.
2718,Slightly off-topic but for me the real question is how temporal technique like XeSS will work on non-specialised circuitry. If overhead penalty is small  that opens up the possibility of NV opening up DLSS.
2719,Small caveat:   AotS just got updated  [https://pbs.twimg.com/media/E\_yGho2VcBAsv0z.png](https://pbs.twimg.com/media/E_yGho2VcBAsv0z.png)  Now it supports up to 16 cores and 24 threads. 'Tinfoil hat on'
2720,Smaller ships that moves fast and hard to hit. Swarm like drones with low dmg but it takes time to kill them. Sniper ships that move fast  keep range then suddenly stop and shoot you. Some gravity based enemy that keep pushing you back or pull you. Enemy with some kind of device that make your ship harder to control  makes some effect on the screen  makes the enemy hard to see with a fog. Teleporting ship that jumps around before shooting. A slow ship with shields around its hull that you have to destroy first or shoot thru the holes of it.  AI wise i would say defensive  agressive  hit and run  sniper  stationary and a skilled one that imitates a real player.
2721,Smt3 is not unfair in its difficulty. I beat it in the early 2000s and used no guides. Its really about how well you use buffs/debuffs. I thought the combat was fun.  Its what made me go on to buy almost every Atlus game for the PS2. That said  its still a PS2 game. Gamers expect a lot more quality of life now than they did back in 2003  so Im not sure how it would hold up by your standards.
2722,So  I'm trying to design a car  (new to the concept for the most part.)  that focuses on having great handling and acceleration. I have been considering using an inline 5-cylinder engine because I think that the weight/size difference over the 6  and the smoother power over the 4 might make it a good choice  not to mention the beautiful sound. Can anyone more knowledgeable give some insight?  Note that this is intended for track use  and not every day street use.
2723,So  is it too soon to call the Big Plot Twist of this season will be that the British Illuminati is secretly run by Moriarty?   Looks like this season might do the 3 episode arc format that the last one did  so I'm kinda curious as to what tone the episodic Lupin eps will be this time
2724,So  my 1060 is probably dead  there is no display. This happened during my sister's new World session  so I have no idea if it's from old age or the software. Either way  I'll still need to know how to change the display from GPU to integrated so I can use the PC while I look for a new card.   Asking because simply moving the cable from GPU to the motherboard still leads to no display  and pretty much all the solutions that Google can find require me to have a display  which is just counter intuitive.
2725,"So  not ideal  but you could make tokens with clues written on them hiding on the GM layer of roll20. You reveal them as they are discovered  and make them moveable by all players through player permissions so players can move them about.   The ""twine"" is harder to pull off. You'll either have to draw it yourself as players discuss  or have various lengths of lines also editable as tokens by the players.  It may be more trouble than it's worth. It's definitely gonna cause a headache or two. Hopefully  only while everyone's learning the ropes."
2726,"So  not really *advice*  but one of my gaming groups has been doing nothing *but* small-shot games for a few years now. We wrapped up a *looong* campaign (which I just discovered our world-building Trello is [still up and public](https://trello.com/b/Ic8j0wvm/royal-pride-of-musketeers-microscope))  and then decided to do a rotating GM thing. Most games we run 3-6 sessions. We did a full run of Band of Blades  which was a pretty long one  but still just a few months of play (at roughly 14 hours of play a month). We do a lot of one-shot storygames. We're all *super* engaged in every game.  So instead of answering your question  I'm going to answer a question you didn't ask: how do you make short games satisfying and enjoyable?  And the real key is that  like any other story  it needs a beginning  middle and end. You can't run a sandboxy ""what do *you* want to do next?"" type campaign  you have to present a clear narrative conflict. You have to get the characters to a satisfying conclusion by the time that conflict resolves. This means giving the players a lot of narrative control  but it also means having a sense of pacing and heightening. It goes from being some endless sprawling fantasy novel to a movie  basically.  Other things: simpler systems are better  especially when it comes to character building/advancement. Fate  FitD  PbtA  Kids on Bikes  these are the backbone of most of our games. I ran some Hillfolk  we do a fair bit of Fiasco."
2727,So  Part VI seems to be setting a similar style as the previous parts with some in series continuity. With Albert here as well  this is set sometime after Part V but it'll probably not continue anything from Part V. Whether it chooses to play a long arc or several short arcs with this longer arc interspersed in between is something that remains to be seen.   It had to happen someday but it's now finally here. Lupin's car (in a series) is now CG for a good amount of screentime including the opening credits. In the previous series  while the rest were CG  his car was still hand drawn for a lot of screentime. Here  the disparity between the CG parts and the parts where it's hand drawn were really easy to make out.   Coming back to the plot  this doesn't seem to be the first encounter between Lupin and Holmes. Lily is most probably Watson's daughter and in their previous encounter  Lupin might have a hand in Watson's death which is why Holmes is immediately hell bent on following Lupin as soon as he sees him and doesn't want Lily to follow him.  This Holmes is quite different from the book Holmes and the reasoning they seem to be going for is that this is a more caring Holmes following Watson's death. But  it's not the first time Japan has had a very different interpretation of this character. Nonetheless  it's sort of a watershed moment for both these characters to share the same space.  Overall a fun episode.
2728,So a couple years ago I was running an online game that covered four different timezones I think. We had two calling in from America (California and Alabama)  one from Australia (Perth) and the rest were UK based (London). It was an absolute nightmare trying to schedule it and it didn't last more than a couple sessions  but it was nice while it lasted. We also briefly had a Russian player and a Hungarian player in the mix  but they didn't gel to well with the group.  What's been your experience? What countries you guys playing from?
2729,So as much as it's annoying. I personally wouldn't worry because in actuality they are only shooting themselves in the foot. Part of the fun of roling is that it inherently effects your roleplay. With roleplay being the aim of the game some of the most creative and fun I have seen players act is when they role poorly. But whether you take heed of this or not number one aim is always players having fun so it's however you feel best achieves that.
2730,So basically as someone who has driven them very little at all. When Im highway driving in them just driving along minding my business I tend to speed significantly and unintentionally the way the cars so smoothly accelerate. Now I image that if it wasnt for the simulate shifting when driving around town I would be speeding terribly and very often. For me its the physical sensation of the shift that allows me to track my speed in town without constantly watching the speedo. During the first pull to 35mph or what ever you can count the shifts  then listen to the rpm. I then know 3rd gear 2500 rpm= 35mph. In a car that never really fluctuates in rpm much and has no shifts I wouldnt realize I was speeding until I noticed I was moving way too fast. Im not a regular cvt driver so the simulated shifting makes the transition much more natural and manageable for me. I have driven side by side cvts that dont shift however in that application the point is to speed and maintaining a consistent speed under a limit is almost never a goal
2731,So basically i haven't gotten around to watching the Mugen train movie  and now that I've heard the anime is re-airing it  i was wondering if it's still worth watching the movie  or just sticking to the anime?
2732,So being shy makes it difficult  but remember you can play the way you want to play.  Find a group that lets you play quietly.   In my game  I have no issue with shy players who don't talk much.  There is nothing wrong with not talking much.  Combat will allow you to talk some and you can ease into the rest of it as you feel comfortable.    The best solution is to just learn how to get over it by trial and error.  If it is an actual problem where you can't do it  then maybe talking to professional help might be a good way to go.  You'd be surprised that once you learn why you act the way you do it is easier to overcome.  If it an option for you  you might give it a try and see if it helps.
2733,"So could you recommend some RPG's? Preferebly bellow ar at 256mb vram.  Games like ""Baldur's gate"" feel too old for me. I would prefer these games to have a good story  that I could influence with my choices  I ABSOLUTELY adore good companions  my favorite games were the Mass Effect trilogy and Dragon age: origins. I'm somewhat open to JRPG'S. Though I don't like final fantasy or trails of the sky style games.  These are games that I have finnished or put a lot of hours in. Some of these I played on Geforce Now  The Witcher  The witcher 2: assassin of kings  The witcher 3: the wild hunt  Vampire the masquarade: bloodlines  Elder Scrolls: Oblivion  Fallout: New Vegas  Fallout 3  Neverwinter Nights 2  Deus Ex  Deus Ex: Human Revolution  Deus Ex: Mankind Divided  Pillars Of Eternity  Divinity 2: Ego Draconis  Fable  Persona 3: Portable  Persona 4  Dragon age: origins  Dragon age 2  Mass Effect  Mass Effect 2  Mass Effect 3  Stars wars: the old republic  Stars wars knights of the old republic II: The sith lords  Jade Empire  Disco Elysium"
2734,"So did anyone else see [the OP](https://streamable.com/dwr66l) get posted on the sub over an hour ago and listen to it on loop the whole time waiting for the episode to release? Because I totally did that. It's no Gurenge  but it's still a great song and the visuals are *wonderful*. [I love this group shot of the Hashira specifically.](https://i.imgur.com/9F4e3M5.png) Also  the fact that they cut right from the best exaggerated ***UMAI!!!*** into the OP is fantastic lol.   I love Rengoku's energy *so fucking much* haha  the comedic bits with him looking off-screen and Tanjiro just being all ""Where are you looking???"" work perfectly for me. This episode also covers the first demon fights seen in the movie  and *boy* does it sure show off how strong he is if last week's episode didn't. My fellow Rengoku fans might love [this wallpaper of him I made](https://i.imgur.com/tqNoMY2.png) based off of when he drew his sword.  [Eyecatch 1](https://i.imgur.com/Qo3Eh3l.png) and [Eyecatch 2](https://i.imgur.com/IaLg5jl.png)  I always love the coloring in these.  [The ED](https://streamable.com/81evia) (which I just made a clip of myself hence the edit on this comment) is even *more* of a banger though holy shit  I didn't get a preview of *that* before watching the episode. I love it so much.  ~~Also I wouldn't be Shimmering-Sky if I didn't point out [Tanjiro had a ""sore demo"" here](https://files.catbox.moe/36tlrp.mp4) so there's that.~~"
2735,So do the VR aps run on the phone  or is it just for controls? I can't imagine that for $500 you can get a build PC that's capable of running very demanding aps. And if it streams from the phone  how is it doing that?  EDIT: It's apparently running a Qualcomms Snapdragon XR1.
2736,"So essentially what your feeling is  this is the first module you've used that gave you the right balance of guidance and creative freedom to make you enjoy DMing but the style isn't engaging your players  right?  One idea  if you and your players would want to  is consider stitching modules together. Instead of continuing with this module  find a new one or storyline that still provides the structure that helps make DMing fun for you but gives some variety and more freedom to your players and tie it in to your current storyline. That way you dont break your stride on this campaign but the players get to switch it up. And the stitch could be a gradual (introducing a couple neutral or friendly NPCs that are influenced and developed by the PCs) or sudden (teleported from a dungeon to a city by whatever trap or scroll or etc etc) as you like.   As for engaging your players  it sounds like you know one of them like characters and RP - consider adding some more ""decision tree"" npc interactions where their choices with the NPC affects their story (either in minor or major ways). For the other players  what do they like? Snarky villains? Cool battle scenes? Rolling dice? Do they not develop their characters cause they arent as in to RP  or because the character decisions dont play a role in the game? If they're new players  maybe encourage smaller RP moments to get them comfortable. Otherwise  try to consider what moments in the last few months keeps bringing them back to the table and give them a little more of that.   It might be worth considering if your experiencing some burnout as well that might be contributing to the vibe (since this is the longest and most regular game you've DMed).   Hope this is good food for thought! Good luck with your campaign! 6 months is an awesome streak for regular sessions!"
2737,So for Morrowind portion of your request: Morrowind is like the other Bethesda games  what puts it apart  is that the guilds are better handled to their individual contexts(setting them more apart)  and stats are a higher focus for combat. What I mean by guilds are better handled  the mage guild is a good example  as it's an political one  where the primary focus of it is interal politics. Almost every quest you get in the mage guild  will have political undertones.  For narrative choice  you have very  very little actual choice in Morrowind. The main quest will have you go in a fairly straight-line(though you 'can' decide to ignore it and\\or kill quest NPCs etc  there's not an actual ending towards doing so).  So  other RPGs caputing the essence you're looking for  answer is; It depends  to not make this much longer than it already is  I'll try to keep it short(List is not ordered in anyway!):  * Pathfinder: Kingmaker - This is like the lovechild between Baldurs Gate and Temple of Elemental Evil. You're somewhat restricted to your alignment choice(which can change during the course of the campaign) and you 'will' have to 'roleplay' within the confines of the campaign(being a baron). BUt 'what' kind of baron you are  is up for grabs. Your choices feel like they have at least 'some' weight into them. * Tyranny: As above  you're confined within the campaign setting(to what dictates your characters primary back-story)  but you're given a lot of flexibility to outline exactly what events you had a hand in prior to the games start(which do matter). * Fallout 1: While I love Fallout 2 more  1 is better for what you're asking. There is some forced combat  but overall  you can theoretically make it through as a non-combatant(by employing companions). XP \\ Leveling is so plentiful  that you can easily pick and choose what quests to do without gimping your character(early game is of course  a bit challenging). * Planescape: Torment - While a pre-defined character  you have complete choice of how  or what you do in the narrative. Most fights for insance  are optional. * Expedition: Viking.  This one  IMO provides more meaningful choices than that of Tyranny  bonus on companions having far more narrative weight as well(if a companion hates someone  they'll punch\\kill them irregardless of what you think or want). Outside of having to do the main-quest   most quests(mainquest or otherwise) provide alternative solutions  including killing everyone. Do however note  it's more linear(it 'is' technically open world  but it follows a very clear linear path and is more focused on the narrative).  Game also features a 'non lethal' toggle that removes criticals  but gurantees you don't kill anyone in the encounter(if you're the type that don't want to kill anyone  even if forced to fight).  Fighthing is however  rarely optional. * Divinity: Original Sin 2 - Ditto to the above somewhat. You can kill absolutely everyone and still finish the game. Many side-quests are
2738,So frustrating as the wagon has normal body colored wheel arches (though personally i way prefer the sedans front and rear  much more sporty looking and unique).      I really hope they give an option to mimic that  or perhaps some other cheap fix because with normal wheel arches I think it looks really good
2739,"So I am looking for games that give you levels of freedom that constantly surprise me. Its a feeling I get every time I play Morrowind. There are so many times in that game where I will think to myself ""Theres no way I can complete this objective in this roundabout crazy way..."" And then HOLY SHIT it worked! I also find similar experiences in older CRPGs and Roguelikes. I will often play some of my favorite Roguelikes like Brogue  and run into situations like ""I cant beat this guy directly  but what if I use this staff to crumble that wall behind him  revealing the group of goblins behind it  then use my other staff to cast a spell on the goblins that will cause them to kill this guy for me?"" Those situations actually work  and are part of the games design. I really have a hard time enjoying games where the goal is clearly meant to be completed in one way that the developer intended. I feel as though the Elder Scrolls games became more and more like this over time for example...  So what are some games  in any genre really  that reward and allow freedom of playing? I know immersive sims  CRPGs  and Roguelikes are generally going to be the genres that shine in this regard of course  but I am interested in pretty much anything. I want to have more of those WOW moments when I play a game... where I cannot believe the game is allowing me to do something in a crazy way that I want to."
2740,So I did not start with D&D and came to play D&D later in my RPG career. My next game will not be D&D because it would be bad at doing what I want to try to do. I love D&D and will probably run it again at some point but I have had my fill of Fantasy Heroes and want to run something else.
2741,So I had something like this come up in my game.  The trick is to make sure that you don't bog down the game with this player's internal drama.  It can be very interesting for both the GM and the player  but can totally suck for the other players if the GM and player take a lot of time dealing with it.  The way I got around it was to write up documents for the player in advance and then send them to her at the correct time in the game.  She would quickly read them and react live.  Yes  it wasn't interactive  she couldn't talk to and get answers to her visions because that is a huge issue with time management for the GM and the game in general.  This method worked really well.  The player had an amazing arc and the other players knew something was up because she was acting a bit weird and kept saying things that didn't make any sense  but zero minutes of game time were wasted on her drama.  In the end  she spilled to the other players what had happened in a very condensed form.  It was amazing for her  amazing for me as the GM and the player really saw some depth in her role-playing without having to see it play out (While they sat there wondering when it was going to be over so they could play).  On the flip side  I was a player in a game with a player who could see an invisible character.  About 30-40% of the game time was spent with the GM and that one player playing out her interactions with the being.  The rest of the players were extremely bored and hated it.  The player involved was very self-conscious of the time she was taking away from the game.  It eventually lead to the players revolting and kicking the GM out of the game! So  that is how you do it badly.
2742,So I had this same exact thing happen to my computer. I got stuck in a boot loop. I ended up taking all the components out of the computer to inspect and reinstall. It turns out that the previous owner of the computer got a little over zealous with the thermal paste on the cpu fan  which resulted in some of it bleeding onto the cpu pins. I carefully cleaned all the compound off  reinstalled everything  and its worked fine ever since.
2743,So I just saw that Witcher 3 is on sale in PS Store for like 300 rupees (4 USD)  which is pretty much the most inexpensive game I found in PS Store. Does t mean it has lost it's relevance  or should I buy it?  Side Question: The GOTY costs around 5 times the amount for the standard edition... It is worth the price?
2744,So I live in NJ there was flooding due to  Ida my computer got wet like it was floating in the water I was only able to save my graphics card and processor.  My motherboard and ram were fried does anyone know where I can take them to get recycled? I heard there is also a place where I could take them and they pay me I bet it's not much but still anything is good especially since I'm in a tight spot so if anyone know where I could take it doesn't matter just so I can recycle it cause I don't want to throw it away in regular garbage. I don't know if this is where I would post this if it's not anyone can tell me where I post it? I'd really appreciate it thanks to anyone
2745,So I own a FWD coupe and I'm going to tell you reasons why I considered it. A insurance much cheaper than a RWD v8 or v6  turbo i4 don't care as much. Next much more unique. After that I don't need a big rear seat and still have plenty of room. It's a wierd but different experience
2746,So I recently got two laptops as birthday gifts  I don't need both of them and when I asked my grandparents if they could return it and get me something else they just told me to sell it and not worry about it. The problem is that it's worth more than $500 and that's the limit FB marketplace and Ebay have on my accounts  I don't know where I'm supposed to sell it and would like any tips or advice.
2747,So if Im understanding this correctly  the pi is enabling the ~30GB movie files (that are already downloaded) to be streamed to your TV via local network (using a trusty wired Ethernet connection)?  If this is the case  I think it makes sense that the pi wont require much internal resources  as:  1. Its not facilitating a download 2. Its not transcoding/processing video data in any way  When the Pi is independently running 4K content  I can confirm that it struggles.  I have an overclocked RPi 4 with 8GB ram running a 4k Dell screen in my workshop  and its unable to run 4k YouTube content without skips/loading issues  despite the purported ability to run up to two 4k displays from the marketing material maybe they meant two 4K still-images 
2748,So I'm a student in computer science and recently started my first real game project. I chose JavaScript since I wanted a browser-based 2d turn-based game. I started developing my game in pure vanilla js  organized my code into different parts (main scripts  classes  images  ...) and got some basic stuff going on (moving the player  shooting  even some basic animations).  The problem is that I am now overwhelmed by how I should organize and design my game. At the moment it is quite messy  I only have classes for game entities / tiles and all the rest (logic  graphics and user inputs) are in one same file (even though my graphics do not interfere with the logic  but they are still in the same place).  I read the whole day about using specific design patterns such as the Model-View-Controller. Even though I understand the idea  I have no clue how to design it. The only examples of MVC that I found in JavaScript were for basic apps like to-do lists (and my game uses mainly a canvas).  I am also lost with how I should do the whole game loop thing with animations  since it is turn-based.  And whenever I look up other people's JavaScript game codes  they always seem super complicated compared to what I am doing.  TLDR: lost in organizing / designing my JavaScript turn-based game and need help!
2749,So i'm deciding on what rpg to buy next  and i've been interested in nocturne since the trailer dropped on the nintendo direct.  However I have heard that the game is pretty difficult  and tedious at times  and that you need to use internet guides for some dungeons.   What is your opinion on this? I dont like needlesly difficult games  also interested in dragon quest 11 and persona 5.
2750,So Im fairly new to RPG gaming in the sense that Ive mainly played the assassins creed games  god of war  stuff like that which has rpg aspects but isnt necessarily full on make a custom character and grind it out type of game. I just started Skyrim for the first time today but I actually dislike how much freedom there is. I was hoping I could get recommendations on some other solo games that have heavy character customization but are also more class based so I can make multiple characters and have completely different skills and maybe even different story. For example  Ive tried out guild wars 2 and I liked how in the character customization each class had their own lore based on upbringing etc. I just really dont wanna play an mmo and would rather play a solo game. I also love finding secret spots or finding that rare piece of op gear because Im an explore every inch type of player. Lastly to help narrow it down  I only have a laptop so I can only play low endish games. For context  I got the original skyrim  oldest version  and it runs fairly smooth  just a tiny bit choppy.
2751,So I'm looking to get a computer(desktop or laptop). To be honest  I mostly just wanna play league of legends and diablo 2 on it. Nothing too crazy. I wouldn't mind higher end  but it's not necessary. Skyrim might be nice.    I have no idea much about computers and figured this sub would be a good place to ask about performance to price ratio  and find what computer might be ideal and a good deal within my budget.    So what/where would be the cheapest you think I could get a decent pc or laptop for? And what details/specs/etc would you recommend paying attention to and looking for?
2752,So Im planning to decorate my Setup Bunny-themed and i noticed there aren't that many ones.  As the Title suggests: Do you know any Bunny-inspired Characters from any Anime or else?  Thanks in Advance! \^\^
2753,So Im playing Final Fantasy Tactics Advance  and I am having fun but also getting a little discouraged because Im not exactly wise in the ways of planning ahead. Theres weapons  classes  stats  etc. that have always made my head spin when Ive tried jumping into other games like Makai Kingdom  Fire Emblem: Awakening  and Eternal Poison  none of which Ive ever played for over an hour  The only game thats similar that Ive ever beaten was ZoE: Fist of Mars  because I love the series.   I guess what Im trying to ask is  are their games that are easier to get into tactic rpgs without being overwhelming? I really want to enjoy the aspect of these chess-like games  but its been difficult. And maybe these games arent for me.   Id like to experience more stories that revolve around these strategy games  just without the disheartening reminder that Im not that smart or clever.
2754,So I've been hitting a bit of a rut lately in terms of what games to play  so I'm looking for something kinda like one of my favorite games  Fallout New Vegas. Namely I'm just looking for some kinda RPG with a focus on character creation and world exploration as a central focus  Edit: also I should say I'm limited to what's available on Xbox One
2755,So I've been thinking a lot lately about what is holding artists back. I find that often you don't need to improve your technical ability  like drawing or sculpting to make more appealing art. It boils down very much to things like picking better colors and learning about composition.  &#x200B;  Are you an artist feeling stuck or a programmer that want to be able to make art for your own projects?  &#x200B;  I would be really curious to hear what you have found hard. What you did to improve. Or what you're still struggling with. What is it that you want to achieve?
2756,So I've had my eye on these games for a while  and right now both of the editions are on sale on Xbox. I was wondering as a new player what should I play first. There are a few things you should know  I play games mostly for the story and then the adventure. I dislike turn based combat. Like I've played Pillars of Eternity and I liked the fact that I was given the option between turn based combat or real time action with pause. I'm asking because I heard one of those games is mandatory turn based combat and I don't wanna waste my last $20 on a game I'm never gonna play.
2757,So looking at this: this is likely either then RAM or a problem with the CPU.   For RAM  find your manual and figure out the RAM banks order. Place one stick in the primary slot  or the first pair  and try each one. Chances are it will only do that on one of the sticks specifically. Seems like you have a bad stick. I usually take the last stick out and put it in the first slot  and then switch everything up one slot  sometimes that can clear this.   Also check the thermal paste on the CPU  it will shut off if the CPU temp climbs too high. If you have old or not enough thermal paste it will do this.
2758,So many complaining about subscriptions.   Yet the market as a whole has repeatedly shown businesses that this is what we want - low monthly payments for things we technically never get to own.   Steam  game passes  streaming services  cell phone plans  financing for *everything*.   My company has worked with some of the major car companies on developing a lot of these programs youll see rolled out in the next decade. Short of some kind of monumental change  nothing is going to stop cars from becoming subscription services on many features.   Again  the buying public is repeatedly showing that this is what will sell and work.
2759,So many edge lords in this comment section. When y'all get much older you'll have a bad time if you don't realize how important contracts are and the shit you can get into from breaching them. Doesn't matter what the context os or how innocent y'all niave little kiddos think it is. Breaching an NDA is serious stuff.
2760,So many good responses here  someone might have already said this:  Stick with what you know - build for web.   Using Unity means learning C#  but it also means learning Unity  which is a pretty alien way to work coming from web dev.  If your game can be kept simple - 2d - I'd wager it's easier to learn game Dev concepts rather than unity specific concepts in another language.  In any case  if you felt like giving a web game a shot I'd be happy to help! Good luck with it
2761,So me and a couple friends of mine decided that we are going to make a Metroidvania game  and my friend said since your the one that came up with the story and pretty much everything else  you should be the moderator. What exactly does he mean by that? He also told me to work more on the story because only like half of it is done.
2762,So much to talk about. From Fido  to Eugene  to the beefy amazingness of the improved juggernauts  and of course to the possible discrimination the 86 are gonna face again.  I don't know how they do it but they never cease to amaze when new episodes come out. Every single episode so far has been a solid 10/10.  I'm so happy Fido is back  and seeing the emotion on Shin during the reunion  him knowing instantly that it's Fido while the others thought it was a new pet. It's moments like that that make me love Shin more.  Obviously Eugene's death was bound to happen. As sad as it is to have Shin's first friend die by his hand yet again  the sadness is definitely getting to him in that last shot of his face.  But GOD DAMN. THOSE NEW JUGGERNAUTS (I forget the real name). Ever sine the opening I've been wanting more of them. They are fucking amazing. Beefy in the right places  more advanced. It's just *French kiss*. Having Shin show up and make the rest jealous or awestruck is so good. (and that scene in the 2-man pilot vangandr or whatever they're called  that flip was insane. I'll learn the names soon)  2 episodes in a row without any Lena  I wasn't expecting this week to not have her either. I'm okay with it since the 86 story is what I wanted more of  and they continue giving exactly what I want. I do hope we get more Lena soon though  but I'm assuming now that we've seen the 86 settle into their true roles we're gonna get more switching again.  Overall  I could talk more about 86 but this is already too long. Its still my top anime of all time and it continues to reinforce its spot at number 1. I love it.
2763,So my car has a 10k km oil change interval  but it burns through an oil changes worth of oil every 10k km  about 5 litres. I just top it off every thousand km or so.   Can I keep doing this while changing the filter every 10k km? Im thinking it would be the same as doing a normal oil change since Im adding in new oil constantly.
2764,So only [battle.net](https://battle.net) matchmaking? Presumably this is to make it harder for anyone to make a non-blizzard master server  &#x200B;  Well  might as well cram as much anti-consumer bullshit in while people are more focused on the systemic abuse.
2765,So sorry you're dealing with this. I think you should be really proud of your accomplishment and I hope you're able to take some of the advice of the commenters here and get through this.  Also  that batshit steam review was written by someone completely unhinged. I hope this teaches everyone to never listen to the opinion of someone crazy enough to only have 6 games in their steam account.
2766,So the enhanced edition for 1 and 2 have gone on sale for switch  and I'm pretty on the fence about getting them. I don't really know shit about these games  but think they just seem really cool. From what I have seen on reviews  the world in them seems pretty cool  and they get brought up a bit on this sub  and people always talk very highly of them. I know they are 20 odd year old games. The age doesn't bother me  just the fact I've never really played any CRPGS  before  and I know absolutely nothing about dungeons  and dragons. A lot of the reviews I've seen are mixed  with people either absolutely loving it  or hating it  because the games don't hold your hand  and they didn't grow up with the games. I've definitely played more jrpg's that western ones. So just really unsure about it? Anyway  would love to hear people's opinions on them  for someone new to this style of RPG. Cheers.
2767,"So the important question(s) when designing travel  travel encounters  and making it ""interesting"" is:   Is this a game about travelling and exploring?   Or is this a game about doing stuff when you get where you're going?   If it's the first kind  then any old exploration mechanics or stories could be great sources of inspiration: don't let fantasy settings throw you off. IF there's a cool idea in there  the orcs & goblins & wizards can easily be repainted to be aliens and robots with lasers  because what they are is less important than what they're doing  and how your players are going to interact with them. I genuinely find that I get my best fantasy ideas reading sci-fi books  and my best sci-fi ideas from fantasy. Why? Because I'm stripping out the setting and looking at what the characters are *doing.*   If it's the latter  and the travel is just vignettes while you're going from interesting bit to interesting bit  maybe have one or two lines describing some interesting sight they might see  describe the ship a little  and then they *Just get where they're going.* Unless it has some significance to the adventure  the most interesting part of travel is going to be reaching the destination  and making everything a three-session-distraction is pretty much impossible to make fun because it only exists to stop people getting to the fun. I try to keep most of my travel sections down to some brief  evocative  descriptions of the things seen on the journey unless I have good reason to expand on it."
2768,So the new Levorg wagon will be renamed the WRX wagon? That kind of partially answers the question many have been asking for.  Have to say the Levorg (or now WRX wagon) looks SO MUCH BETTER without those silly black plastic body cladding and the massive black bumper doesn't stand out as much on a wagon.
2769,So the other week my power went out and my pc got surged and i changed out the motherboard and the power supply but now every time i got up my computer and log in the monitors just randomly go to sleep. Can someone help me with this or explain what i can do to fix it
2770,So they made something that looks like a large phone  and are surprised when people use it like a large phone (portrait mode)  If this is indeed a standard issue of LCD screens then this is a clear case of Apple detetmined to push its user base to use their devices in a way they don't want to. Apple's strength is in user experience  so this is embarrassing.
2771,So this Gyes guy (the main beastman swordfighter  not the monkey dude) is 100% Ghilaine's brother/cousin or whatever  right? They look *very* related.  Please don't confirm LN readers  I'm a simple anime-only.
2772,So what is Intel releasing a new line of CPUs every few months now? And are we going to keep acting like its a big deal it outperforms zen 3 when its a year old? Just take a sip of water  zen 4 will smack Intel around  Edit: Sheeeesh I made some Intel kiddies mad overnight!
2773,So when I run  I don't get excited to use specific mechanics. I get excited for how those mechanics help me produce the experience I want the players to have.   Beyond that  it's about the NPCs  the events I have in mind  and finding ways to provoke reactions from my players.
2774,So you saw that FC that recently sold for $60k as well  huh?  I drive all of my collector cars because I want to enjoy them. I have a S5 FC that I paid $400 for in 2005 that has seen 3 different drivetrain combinations and I'll probably never get rid of it.
2775,So... due to the high demand of GPUs Nvidia is mostly pumping out GA102s and GA104s and not enough GA106s because higher end video cards have better margins and this is the reason why these cards exist?
2776,Socket 775 was soo fun. A $49 2.5Ghz e3300 celeron cpu could be overckocked to over 3.8 Ghz that competed with the mighty core 2 duo E8400. It made me fall in love with hardware. As of late I don't even bother to overclock due to the deminishing returns on power draw.  It sucks. Good luck to them. I'll be hoping for a comeback.
2777,Solar Blades & Cosmic Spells has a lot of useful tables that could work with SWN tables too.  SB&CS has some serious Heavy Metal feeling to it.  I forgot to add The Metamorphica is a system agnostic set of random tables for mutations plus lots of other thematically useful things.  Again useful with the other assets out there.
2778,Solasta has no story  characters  even mildly interesting npcs. It is 100% combat only and there are limited interesting combat encounters.   Pathfinder for me were the closest to replicating the baldur's gate experience
2779,Solasta is DnD 5e at its best (even better than BG3) but the story line is pretty linear so your choices don't have much impact. Pathfinder is much more immersive and similar to D&D 3.5 (but Pathfinder is an entirely different game system). At the moment it is still a bit buggy but there's constantly coming new patches out. As A player and Beta Tester of both  I would recommend Pathfinder. You can play Wrath of the Righteous without needing to play the 1st game Kingmaker  as they don't directly follow up on each other. Pathfinder also has Heroes of M&M 3 style Crusade battles and effectively takes your party up to level 30 and gameplay is strongly based on your choices.
2780,Sold Activision blizzard at their peak. Flipped it over to AMC and GME a year ago.   As long as their share price holds  these clowns won't change a damn thing. What AA is doing with AMC is ground breaking. He has a stronger relationship with retail shareholders than blizzard does with it's players.
2781,Sold it. It was a Chevy Silverado with the 5.3 during a time when gas was 3.50/gallon (not too far off here on Maryland now). And it blew a head gasket and I didn't have the skill to fix it when I was 17. So I got a Mitsubishi Galant in it's place.
2782,"Solid first episode.   I think the movement of the CG cars is quite good and has weight behind it. But I wish they would draw over it more to make it fit better into the general style of the series.  Same for the photographs they use as reference for the backgrounds. There was one cut shortly after the roof of the car got blown off (the one with ""not McDonalds"") that looked more like 2D animation on top of live action footage  rather than 2D animation on top of a drawing. Recently I feel like noticing this trend of some backgrounds just looking like reference photos with filters on them  rather than drawings  more and more. Is that a thing? But besides that one cut I really enjoyed the background art."
2783,Some anime are harmlessly bad  but then you have these.  What anime was that for you?  *Your Lie In April:* I've never seen a series that actively hated people with trauma this badly.  Kousei gets bullied and beaten into going back to playing piano  which is tied to him getting violently abused by his mother.  The narrative paints this as good for him because Naoshi Arakawa can't write.  They will play abuse for drama and then for comedy sometimes in the same scene.  Is abuse bad or hilarious?  Pick a lane or get off the road  Arakawa.  The worst part is that the fandom defends this shit and victim blames Kousei.  I'm so glad Arakawa's soccer anime died in obscurity.  He doesn't deserve another hit after that shit.
2784,Some great suggestions here - I'll throw in Terraria.  &#x200B;  You've probably heard of it as Minecraft but 2D  and while it that on the face of things  it's more of a sidescrolling rpg that just so happens to take place in a pixellated world made of blocks you can break and replace.  The main way it suits your criteria is mainly to do with boss fights  and how you prep for them - building arenas or platforms  there's even some strats where you can make life-leech farms to constantly heal you
2785,Some manufacturers are extra picky about battery warranties on vehicles that arent driven much. Get a trickle charger to maintain your battery going forward.   I have worked for a few companies that monitor usage and drive cycles (BMW is one). So yes  they can deny the warranty but Id advise you to push back. If they deny it under regular warranty  they could probably replace it as a goodwill gesture for customer satisfaction.
2786,Some of the details didnt sit super well with me.  An extremely young child is allowed on the frontlines of a war? Not just that but shes apparently Shins handler (command/info)? (Which is doubly amusing given how the federacy cant go 5 minutes without reminding the 86 how good and moral they are because they dont send kids to war). I know the show mentions the mascot thing is a dying custom  but still.   Fido is brought back for no reason completely rendering part 1s emotional wrecking at his death useless. So why even include that part? It completely negates any emotional consequence of that entire scene and messaging. I mean Im happy hes back  of course  but to me  it cheapens his death in the first place.   All the characters already have omega plot armor  now Fido does too  literally being resurrected.   The 1 dimensional hate for 86 for. Being good at their job? The 1 dimensional constant moral aggrandizing about how good the federacy is because they (86) dont need to fight and can live a normal life   Then last episode we had the whole speech about how not letting child soldiers return to war is literally as bad as committing genocide.   I love the atmosphere and plot of this episode  but some of the elements really dont land for me.   Season 1 part 1 was amazing  but some of this parts writing (so far) are really making me question whether or not it can keep up that momentum. (Thats not even mentioning the barely disguised flag  tho I actually kinda liked that direction/hard cut)  Please dont mistake me  I still think that its an 8 or 9/10 show   Im only pointing out what I dont like  I do love *a lot* else about the show  Edit: some autocorrect
2787,Some of these scores still don't make any sense to me. 12900k has double the score of a 11900k? Lets pretend like you disabled the 8 small cores  and only ran the large ones for core parity with the 11900k. And lets assume it's overall 25% faster per core. Feel like I'm being generous here.  15514 x 1.25 = 19393 for the new 8 cores.  So that is still over 11 100 points missing to get to 30549. Are you telling me those small cores are doing more work than a 9700k OC'd to 5GHz?
2788,"Some of you may remember this previous thread: https://www.reddit.com/r/gamernews/comments/osl5vi/dell_wont_ship_energyhungry_gaming_pcs_to/  From the Tom's Hardware article:  > Acer and Lenovo  however  have no issues. Acer told Tom's Hardware that ""Acer desktops shipped after July 1  2021 are fully compliant with the new power consumption regulations.""  > Lenovo's statement is that ""We dont face any restrictions for where we can ship and sell our Legion desktop products. We are compliant with our Legion desktops that will be on the market and ones to come to the market moving forward.""  ...  > ""Just the motherboard itself can resolve 80% of the 690-point system "" MSI's Chun said. Obviously the power supply and all this other minor stuff will contribute the rest of the points. He also pointed out that BIOS tweaks adjusting standby power are also a big part.  ...  > Spokespeople for HP and Asus all said they would look into the matter  but did not answer by press time. But based on the answers we do have  it seems that most major pre-built vendors will be over this hurdle soon.  > ""These regulations were developed in 2016 to address energy use when computers are idle  wasting energy and millions of dollars "" CEC executive director Drew Bohan said in a statement to Tom's Hardware. ""They were designed with input and involvement from industry  including Dell  to be flexible.  Dell engaged in some 4D chess strategy: https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2016/12/california-adopts-first-energy-efficiency-standards-for-pcs-in-us/  > Despite the more stringent rules  the Information Technology Industry Councilwhich includes HP  Intel  Dell  and Lenovo among many otherssupported the CEC's new rules. ""The tech industrys support for these historic guidelines follows a collective effort by the CEC with technology companies and environmental leaders to achieve the highest energy efficiency standards that will save consumers money without stifling innovation or the economic growth being driven by the tech sector "" the council wrote in a press release.  1. Publicly support (or at least stay quiet) about the new regulations that were coming up.  2. Do nothing for ~5 years after the new regulations were agreed upon by the entire industry when they could have used that time to mobilize their lobbyists and lawyers to attack the new regulations.  3. Act surprised when computers with low quality power supply units don't meet the new standards that everyone else had adopted."
2789,Some people are just soo stupid. Do they not know what NDA stands for?? To be frank  they got off lightly  They are well within their rights to sue for breach of contract if they wanted. The only thing protecting the players is anonymity. Bloody lucky.
2790,Somehow I aint optimistic about intels venture into GPU  of course more competitors will be good for the consumers. But knowing Intel  very likely the GPU investment wont be able to meet the shareholders expectations and will be abandoned  thus intel dedicated gpu segment will be transfer to focus more on embedded IoT devices in the future. At the current stage and phase they are still far away from Nvidia or AMD. The rate at which Intel release driver when compared to Nvidia and AMD  will leave many gamers frustrated.
2791,Someone already mentioned Kenshi. Amazing game.   Kingdom Come: Deliverance sometimes can really surprise you with how you can solve some quests. KCD is a spiritual successor to Morrowind in many ways. So you should check it out.
2792,"Someone told me ""take the car completely stock then decide what you wanna mod later""    Well nobody told me to check the manufacturer date on the tires. They looked good to me  tread depth was fine  no dry rotting. Third lap in my front tires gave out and I binned it into the dirt and got black flagged. They told me to check my car over so I looked and realized the tires were 11 years old.     Before your first track day  do tires  brakes  brake fluid and make sure your suspension is up to the task of any upgraded tires you add. Blew a strut on my frs adding 255/40 r17 200tw tires."
2793,Someone was on here just the other day complaining about day.  Her and her husband were trying to start a game at their house  and all the people who showed up just kinda acted like they were trying to swing.    I'm in my early 40s  and I notice this is happening more and more.  It wasn't an issue in my 30s.  The younger elements of our hobby seem far more exclusive.
2794,something i've learned about game development is that you have to be able to use one thing for multiple other things. i assume when you say dead end  you mean problems. the first step to solving them is finding out the root of the problem; what it is. then try to use it to your advantage  or find a way around them. searching for solutions online is extremely helpful  or if you dont find what you're looking for  just **ask.** you can use websites like stackoverflow  or reddit. and try to keep your code as short and understandable as possible. give it a second chance.  good luck.  also  i see you're a cicada 3301 connaisseur.
2795,Something similar albeit not toxic happens to me because when I have enough material from media I have a session ready. And when I need inspiration I watch a movie or three and then I have enough for planning a session. When I have enough material I don't feel like watching anything else.
2796,"Sometimes random chance goes in your favor  sometimes over multiple rolls.   If your suspicions really amount to ""she rolled too well"" I think you should drop it. Unless you have some actual reason to believe she cheated  or some reason to believe this character will be disruptive for your game  just leave it be. It's just a game. You say everyone else always rolls poorly  and somehow that didn't seem weird to you. That's just as unlikely as her rolling well a couple of times in a row."
2797,"Sometimes we do that [in our podcast](https://sponsoredbynobody.podbean.com/) - we start a game  run it for a bit  and then switch to something else and never come back to the old one. It can be a bit frustrating.  I think the best way to handle that would be to anticipate it. Commit yourself to a short game with a satisfying conclusion and run it for that long. No grand games that plan on going forever  but a tight story that you wrap up in like 4-5 sessions.  If the players are into that  great  you can have some good time  try different systems  see what works. Maybe you'll even find a longer-term system for yourself that way that you'll come back to.  If they are not  you should probably discuss how to proceed. Maybe someone else should GM for a bit  maybe you should settle for a ""good-enough-system""  etc.  Sometimes it could also be the fault of the system you're playing. I've found that PbtAs have a bit of a finite run time in comparison to other types of games - https://tpsrpg.blogspot.com/2017/12/finite-vs-infinite-games.html . It could be a factor in what makes you want to play a game for longer."
2798,Sometimes you are offered default archetypes - for example in Pathfinder. You can take those 'established' characters and roll with it! I also like sometimes to start the game and see what happens in the beginning - if there is any background lore established for my protagonist. One example: Shadowrun Hong-Kong had surprisingly personal story and witnessing that really helped me interpretate the character better.  Worst case scenario - base your character on yourself (are you stronger  more agile  smarter  charming? Whichever is the case  find class that fits - never can go badly with default Fighter - and go at it). That may sound boring  but it's just a starting point. Let the game events actually shape your character  grow it into it's own being.
2799,Soo noone is going to mention Legend of the dragoon? Ps1 or super mario and the legend of the 7 stars on snes?? Or borderlands every single last one of them...Bl3 was ok tho. Fallout 4. Skyrim.   Those are truly my favorite rpg games.
2800,Sorry for the broad question - I am super new to the idea. My game is entirely self-funded and I'll be completing it on my own by early-ish next year  so my only reason to get a publisher would be for marketing (I think).  Does anyone have any advice about what to look for in a publisher? For example:  * What kind of revenue split would be reasonable? * Do they typically attach their bank account to steamworks and send me payments as per contract  or vice versa? * Are there any red flags I should be watching for to tell if they're one of those scam publishers?  Honestly I'm not even sure what kinds of questions I should be asking or where to start  so any advice would be really appreciated.
2801,Sorry for the embarrassingly naive question. I have long been wanting to get into TTRPGs particularly after listening to a great Shadowrun and Stillfleet podcast ([Fun City/Float City](https://funcity.ventures/)). My issue is that every single person and group I've talked to locally plays good ol' 5e D&D and I'm just not into the sword-and-sorcery type setting. It's just struck me as odd that the only system/setting that people around me play is D&D.  (Maybe I should just try it anyway. I guess it's also possible that I've just not gotten into it enough to really get a feel for it. Hell  Stillfleet is as fantastic as it is sciencey. It (sword and sorcery/DnD) just doesn't excite me the way SciFi settings do.)
2802,Sorry if someone has this  but it is honestly the worst monitor i've ever seen.  &#x200B;  https://preview.redd.it/tmvlmaqxrbs71.jpg?width=1024&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=72c5f05beb6456b69b4d159dbebc7a86c397fcd5  What do you think about it?  &#x200B;  (This is not for offense  is just an opinion)
2803,Sorry to interrupt the anti-apple circlejerk  but yes  this has always been a thing. On my MBP I can clearly see the jelly scrolling horizontally using this test: https://www.testufo.com/scanskew#speed=1&direction=horiz&bounce=1&density=4&center=1  That said  it does seem like it's more noticeable for the mini  so people who find it distracting should just return it.
2804,Sounds like *Golden Sun*:  1. Good gameplay with unique mechanics. 2. Not a lot of grinding required that I remember. 3. Awesome graphics. The best in the GBA  I'd say. 4. Great music by Motoi Sakuraba  some of his best soundtracks in my opinion. 5. Yeah  they are fun. This is of course subjective. 6. There are 3 games in the series. They have to be played in order as the story continues from one game to the next. The second one starts right after the end of the first one. The third is set 30 years after the end of the second one.  The titles and play order is: *Golden Sun* \[GBA\] -> *Golden Sun: The Lost Age* \[GBA\] -> *Golden Sun: Dark Dawn* \[DS\].
2805,Sounds like a balancing issue.  I highly  HIGHLY recommend getting the wheels and tires road force balanced. Rotational balancing is terrible in comparison.  Any reputable shop with the ability to perform road force balancing should be able to determine if there is a defective tire.
2806,Sounds like action-adventure games might be more your speed. No stats to worry about  fun exploration in large environments  fun puzzles to solve  story that's not the main draw of the game. Zelda is always a great choice. If you want other choices there's Legacy of Kain  Darksiders  Horizon: Zero Dawn  Alundra 2  Landstalker  Dual Hearts  Ittle Dew  Reverie  Blossom Tales  Astral Chain  etc. These games all prioritize gameplay over story and complex systems. The stories are a nice bonus and add a lot  but the gameplay is the main draw.  I love RPGs but sometimes they can feel long-winded and repetitive. That's why the simplicity of action-adventure games can be a great alternative. That way I still get the stories and exploration that I love  minus all the grinding that I have to be in a certain mood to enjoy.
2807,"Sounds like bad bushings somewhere if it's only doing it during acceleration....probably control arms.  Tires don't cause these issues by ""being too grippy"".    Vibration all the time and gets worse with speed....that's a wheel balance issue."
2808,"Sounds like it's just not for you gets used all the time and is the most useless thing anyone could say at least 90% of the time. If someone's trolling or just not giving anything to go off of then sure whatever  but way too many people use this to try and completely shut down any discussion that isn't full on praise of an anime they like. It's especially bad when someone has provided a reasonably detailed discussion of what they didn't like  because they've just outlined why it ""just isn't for them"". Now they want to talk about it."
2809,Sounds like Karens of gaming. Garens?  Im nowhere near even releasing anything about my project  and i'm dreading that day already. It might be a few years away still. I'd say to ignore those as they don't seem to listen at all.
2810,"Sounds like Phison's gearing up for the next wave of SSDs with their E26 controller  beginning with enterprise parts:  (Partial citation  Reddit is being a jerk and screwing up my formatting)  \-----------------  ""Phison is actively developing its first PCIe Gen5 platform named the E26 Series Controller and SSD and has two key differentiating advantages.  First  Phison makes more of the critical intellectual property (IP) blocks inside the controller than any other company  thereby eliminating dependencies and inconsistencies that competitors have when they source 3rd party IP for their controllers.  Second  that the E26 controller IP is developed concurrently with Phisons firmware in an FPGA environment  even before tape out ensuring a fast time to market with the highest reliability at introduction.  Phison will be providing early E26 Gen5 SSD samples to industry-leading motherboard manufacturers so their engineers can tune their electrical signal link-ups  command timing  and BIOS to Phisons Gen5 SSD controllers and firmware.  Phisons E26 SSD platform will support PCIe Dual Port  and have advanced features such as SR-IOV and ZNS  and support for the newest  fastest NAND interfaces ONFI 5.x and Toggle 5.x.  While PCIe Gen4 SSD shipments are still ramping up  there are many server and storage customers who will want to transition to PCIe Gen5 as soon as that technology is available  said Jeff Janukowicz  Research Vice President at IDC. By helping to enable an ecosystem  Phisons customizable E26 SSD is at the forefront of PCIe Gen5 introductions and will facilitate data center customers looking to benefit from the technologys increased performance.  Phisons E26 SSD solution is designed to be a best-in-class combination of performance at low power using Phisons unique architecture of low power consumption ARM R5 CPUs and an array of super low power but high performance CoXProcessor 2.0 technology.  The E26 is a customizable SSD platform that will be available in M.2  U.3  E1.S  and E3.S form factors.  The E26 Gen5 test chip has been successfully taped out in 12nm advanced process  and customized SSD solutions are targeted to be shipping in the second half of 2022.""  \-----------------  Should be an interesting time for high bandwidth storage next year."
2811,Sounds like want happened with my dads 01 Accord and any Honda with a factory CD player that Ive interacted with. The OEM radio player doesnt like burned discs and usually cant read MP3s.   Definitely agree with the others to burn the disc differently.
2812,Sounds like youre dealing with some intrusive thoughts and obsessive-compulsive behaviour. This is stuff that a qualified psychologist can help you with much better than a community of random Redditors. Dont dismiss these issues as trivial! Your mental health is important  and if you werent into RPGs this same behaviour would likely manifest somewhere else in your life.  Ultimately this is supposed to be a fun hobby  so if its not fun for you and its ruining your enjoyment of other things  then something is definitely wrong.  Find a qualified psychologist to talk to! Good luck  friend.
2813,Sounds like you're trying to invest your effort into a game system instead of the campaign.  Stop focusing on mechanics and start focusing on the campaign/world you're creating.  My campaigns last years because I create the world or at least my version of it and have more invested in it than whether I like the module I bought or the game system mechanics.   I have so many ideas for what to bring to my gaming table that my campaign outline grows constantly and I have to pare down so many of my ideas or accept I'll never get to the bottom of the outline.    My group has been together for decades and have switched versions twice.  We're all veterans of the system and can focus on playing and creating stories in the world we're building.  I don't think I'll ever the benefit of jumping from system to system.  How do you master it if you're never more than dipping your toes into it? How do you move past constantly looking for what the rule is on this or that and focus on breathing life into the thing you're all supposed to be creating?  I think the issue is people that buy off the shelf adventured vs those who create their own.  Mind you  at this point I dont create everything from scratch.  I define an idea and then look at what I have or what is out there to help me fill it in.  Be it a map from online or an old module I have  web tools to help create NPCs  or magic items from some of the older rulebooks we used to play.  I think that if you invest your time and energy into your creation  you'll be less inclined to put it down for the next shiny that pops up.
2814,Sounds to me like the player doesn't enjoy the way you play your game and is trying to make the game fun for herself by cheating a bit during character creation.  You might want to consider the problem that's causing her to cheat  rather than blaming her entirely.  If I find a player is cheating during my game  I take that to mean that they are not getting something they want from the experience.  Generally speaking  it doesn't bother me.  As the GM I can always challenge the party - no matter how well you roll - and higher stats/abilities just means I can confidently throw more powerful creatures at you.  It also means  though  that once I've discovered a player is cheating  I no longer have to hold myself to honesty when dealing with that character in the game - they are essentially an npc in combat and I can just make up whatever dramatic results I want on my dice  just like the cheater.   Talk to the player  of course  and decide what works best for you but cheaters neither bother  nor worry  me in a game.

2816,Speed limiting the Autobahn is a stupid idea. Adding a lot of time to people's commute just makes living in a village that much harder. It would add a lot of time to courier services too  there's not a Sprinter van that doesn't do 160kph. As can be seen in Australia  the largest killer on the roads is fatigue. The longer you are on the road after a day of work  or taking a trip  the greater the chances that fatigue will lead to a serious accident.  There's no way in hell I want to drive from Munich to Leipzig at 130kph  you can kiss my 200kph ass.
2817,Spell combos are very strong. So experiment with spell combinations. (or just look up how to do Mass Paralysis and trivialize 90% of the game)  Other than that  play whatever  the game isn't super difficult (unless maybe on nightmare). All companions are perfectly viable too  if you build them somewhat sensibly.     Edit: and to make your life easier get some anti-mage spells. Mages can oneshot your entire party with one chain lightning cast  but you can oneshot them as well with certain abilities.
2818,Spiders are predators in the animal kingdom  so large ones will logically go after bigger prey. They also arent picky about prey so theyll try their luck with anything they can catch including humans. 
2819,Spot dimming of the windshield. Instead of dimming the entire piece of glass like you can get in some applications  I want one that can dim small sections at a time. Combine that with an outside camera and one that tracks your eyes and you can have your windshield dim *just* the section where you have oncoming high beams or sunlight bouncing off a chrome bumper while the rest of it stays clear.
2820,Stages of Apple Systemic Issues:  1) It's not a problem  2) They're using it wrong  3) It's only affecting a very small selection of products  4) Listen just bring it into the Apple Store for further education  5) We're extending the warranty for 6 months on this product (Product launched 1 year and 7 months ago)  6) Fixes issue in the next iteration of the product without a word
2821,Star Wars Knights of the Old Republic doesn't need a remake.  The game's real time with pause style of combat isn't what modern mainstream audiences usually look for  but nothing about it is inherently wrong or poorly designed.  It's a great RPG and a remake won't really be able to do much to improve on what's already there.  What we really need is a KOTOR 3.
2822,Starfinder is fun and is often goofy. The sheer number of playable races gives it a bit of a Star Wars cantina feel.  Note that it space fantasy more than hardcore sci-fi.  Starships and laser guns alongside spellcasters and dragons.
2823,Stars Without Number deluxe edition has about 150+ pages devoted to system neutral sci fi adventure design AND random table based worldbuilding too. Well worth the buy imo  regardless of what system you use
2824,Start a Kdrama it works wonders for me   i can barely finish episodes of anime these days its a refreshing break also Vincenzo   Hotel Del Luna are both well done Kdramas if you have watched any yet i highly recommend those
2825,Start with the most likely problem.  New tires and now a shaking when accelerating.  Probably not balanced  or possibly incorrectly balanced  was the rim or wheel damaged at the shop? Maybe an alignment? Could a ball joint or other suspension part have been damaged since?
2826,Started a new playthrough of Phantasy Star IV and god I love that game. It's just so satisfying when you get the hang of how and when you use all the different techniques. Something I love about this game is how every character has some techs that use MP and some skills that have a limited number of uses that recharge when you rest  so you can use some special attacks and cast some buffs/debuffs without worrying about saving your MP for more useful spells or for bosses.  Also tried to play Shin Megami Tensei II again. Love the story and the presentation but i think ill drop it again  the combat isn't very interesting (or maybe I didnt get the hang of it yet  if someone has any tips I'd be glad to hear them!) and some of the mazes feel unnecessarily complicated when they don't even have battles or anything in them.
2827,started with r/rpg_gamers  ended with r/getdisciplined. lol I'm 32 and I play a lot of different games  work  study and still have time to party on the weekends. Every person is different and it's all about how you organize your day and priorities. But like you  I prefer having just 1 game at a time  and I prefer longer games too. Currently playing FFXIV just for the story (when I get to endgame I'll ditch it  cuz I'm not a hardcore mmo player)
2828,Statistics shows that it is possible  almost inevitable  that people will roll good eventually  a data set that misses some extremes or pattern of outcomes becomes suspicious.   Its possible she just got good rolls multiple times and you'll see them be bad in the future.   But you have to ask yourself  is it ruining the game? Or making it less fun for everyone? I can understand wanting everyone to follow the rules  but if it isn't disrupting anything then it doesn't seem that big a deal.
2829,"Stay with it. At times it'll be the most frustration imaginable. ""Why won't this work? It was working yesterday. Why is it broken now? I haven't touched that area."" And ""but I followed the YouTube tutorial **exactly**  why is it not working??"" But it's brilliant when you over some the problems."
2830,Steam-fantasy-adventure game Astraterra was just released in English! Pretty much perfect for those ages and highly praised here in Finland.  https://www.drivethrurpg.com/product/373356/Astraterra-The-Explorers-Guide  The preview don't seem to work yet but character sheets  rules summary and map are available here: https://astraterra.fi/en/downloads/
2831,Step 1 Add epic music  Step 2 Make the enemy boss giant version of something small for example: giant crab giant squid giant spider  Step 3 Make the boss have lots of health and a lot off damage plus a big damage cool down  Step 4 Add week point  Step 5  Make boss die in a cool animation
2832,Step 1. Play D&D with locals and find a good few friends. Step 2. Recruit those friends to play other forms of TTRPG.   I find that D&D is a great way to introduce people to the concept  but you'll likely find others who are interested in playing other games  too!
2833,Step Up/Down (from cortex plus)  The short hand should be +1# (As in increase of type) but it would be lost since nowdays nobody now what # means anymore :)  I have also seen it expressed as +s -s [+ size  - size] at least once.
2834,Still not sure how to feel man. Especially seeing this entire reel before the reveal makes me feel like they really lost what the WRX was in its essence. The wagon really is a Levorg/Impreza but looks a bit off. Lets hope it is atleast good and has a good 6sp manual.
2835,Still taking opinions ? ... just finished the first game and dlc and 15 hrs into the next game .... ( played on story mode mostly)  ... and also if you let me know any RPGs you played apart from jrpg can help me narrow down the answer !
2836,Still very much enjoying this one and really appreciate how much world-building they are doing in terms of the history of the world and its religions/Gods. It definitely seems like it's building up to something since several events seem to be timed at the same time (Will's coming of age  choosing a God  something the three ghosts are hiding).  The OP and ED show there's a lot of things to see in the World and many characters to meet  so I would imagine we'll have to start heading out soon in order to do that.
2837,Stock xdrive M3/4s are running 3.2 to 60 so seems pretty accurate. Monster of a car. Im guessing they couldnt use full LC for the GTR though as it should have been with the M3 or ahead much earlier if they had.
2838,Stop giving these people media attention. They have never released a game  and this current situation has been nothing but lies and misdirection. Giving them more headlines and attention is only rewarding a very deceitful company.
2839,Straight fives are viable  but IMO straight 4s are slightly more viable assuming you are not going to ruin the exhaust sound by turbocharging the engine  Straight 4s can produce lots of power  it produces more low end torque and make an exceptional engine sound if you give it a good exhaust and make the air intake system out of carbon fibre (as an example) to get good induction noise.  Both in-line 5 and 4s would need a balancing shaft to run smooth  inline 5s are slightly  better balanced but the balance is still not ideal.  Inline 4s are shorter which is good for rigidity and obviously have less moving parts so weight is reduced quite a bit  Inline 4s are more compact    Inline 5s have more power overlap so a lighter weight flywheel can be used which will make it produce slightly more power and generally allows the engine to be mounted slightly lower to the ground which improves the handling. But the compactness of a inline 4 can allow for more sophisticated suspension setup if space is limited so keep that in mind.   Inline 5s have slightly smaller cylinders so the overall performance is increased a little bit   Inline 5s generally sound better than turbo inline 4s  I might reply with more info
2840,Subaru is like the middle aged guy that still brags about his high school football career. Cool and all but damn. Its like Subaru didnt exist after WRC and they are still trying to milk the whole 90s/00s Subaru rally image.   I think I would still prefer the crosstrek body with WRX/STI powertrain. Cool to see a WRX wagon though.
2841,Such a sweet episode; although the first part is a bit tiring about boob size again but the topic is reasonable enough to be worked in from the last episode hook  the gags were fun enough and didn't last long enough to be too annoying.  Should be prescribed viewing after 86 each week!
2842,Suikoden 1 and 2. Saga Frontier (how is this not mentioned more?). Terranigma. Chronotrigger AND Chronocross. Legend of Zelda (any really.. but Ocarina of Time foremost). Baldurs Gate II is conspicuously absent from your list..
2843,"Suikoden Tactics on PS2 doesn't have any class changing  you just get a large roster of characters with different fighting styles and abilities  and you use elemental terrain effects to strengthen your allies and weaken your enemies. Unfortunately  the story is not very good. Most of the fun comes from how characters interact with each other during combat.  Vandal Hearts 1 on PS1 is also very straight forward for a tactical RPG. Once you change a character's class they are stuck with it  and you can't replay any battle maps that you've completed  so there's no ""grinding"" involved."
2844,Sure its only when gas is applied? It could be an engine bog that drops the rpms  driveshaft or slipping belt.  I dont think the quality of rubber on tires would make any shaking.  Check the mileage  it could have been joy ride red lining the rpms time.
2845,Surprised no one's recommended Divinity: Original Sin or D:OS2  or Pathfinder: Kingmaker  since they're some of the most recommended RPGs in this sub and it doesn't look like you've played them.  D:OS/2 are turn-based and Kingmaker can be turn-based  if you want. Both epic  sprawling RPGs with pretty fantastic stories and hundreds of hours of play to be had. All are party-based so you'll have your pick of companions and party builds and fun  entertaining companion personalities.  I recently played through Baldur's Gate 1 and 2 for the first time. They did end up feeling a little old for me  I was ready for more modern games by the end  but I still enjoyed the stories and am glad to finally have experienced them. I'm playing through Pillars of Eternity now (having played Deadfire a while back) and look forward to playing Deadfire again with more context - highly recommend that one if you liked POE. I've got Greedfall and Planescape Torment on my list next.
2846,"Swap out the engine for something bigger  add a supercharger  fat sticky tires on the back.   ""Johnny rolled out his 1994 Corvette. To most it looks like an old cruiser for baby boomers trying to cling to the strands of their glory days. But Johnny's 'Vette is oh so much more. The old tired 350 is long gone. A shiny new 376 sits in its place adorned with the car's party piece: the supercharger that is larger than the engines you find in a hamster-powered Civic. All of this horsepower can barely be tamed so Johnny had to outfit fat tires on the rear that make your typical McDonald's customer look like a toothpick."""
2847,Switch to Savage Pathfinder and maybe run Rise of the Rune Lords  Aside from a bias shilling of not PF2e  perhaps have the inhabitants of the dungeon be able to be reasoned with. This is also a problem I have with Paizo APs is most foes are 100% crazy suicidal and won't be reasoned with.  You can also check out Worlds Without Number for the system agnostic sandbox generation tools if you want to create more PC specific engaging content.
2848,Take a BIG break from media  like NO media for a bit. And either seek professional help (e.g. therapy) and/or engage with a spiritual practice (e.g. yoga  meditation  a faith community). Exercise and/or nature would probably do wonders as well.
2849,Take a break and do something completely unrelated to anime for a bit.  Clear your mind.  Binges can be a bit damaging for fun in general so try to limit yourself.  Also  you may want to try watching something completely outside your usual comfort zone.  Like  if you usually just watch shounen  then try a shoujo or something more mature or just something made by crazy people.
2850,Take a huge breath  close your eyes  and turn on the way back machine to when you were first learning the web.   If you are even remotely competent as a web developer you know a pile of complex technologies and methodologies for developing even a simple web app. When you started those were not easy for you either.  I would bet that someone coming from straight game development to web would have many of the same feelings you do. Keep learning  experimenting and building.
2851,"Take Foxbody. Strip out the interior. Throw about $10k at the original engine. Upgrade the suspension. Proceed to obliterate $200k modified 911s and GTRs in a car that you built in the garage for $25k.  https://youtu.be/4m-7efuVjJg  ""331-Inch 495 HP Small-Block Ford - Car Craft Magazine"" https://www.motortrend.com/how-to/ccrp-0810-302ci-small-block-ford/amp/"
2852,Take the car battery out and bring it to a local shop to get it tested (not the entire car). Japanese cars are easy to get to the battery for the most part.  Once it is tested for free  get the report on the battery for your own records. Then take the battery over to the dealership to show them and see if they will test it for free.  The tow bill will already be more than the cost of the battery to be honest and to get another manufacturer battery which is already bottom of the barrel kind of battery is a waste of time and money anyways. Go to Walmart and buy the battery that fits and has the longest warranty. Call it a day!
2853,Takes me back to when I learned how to drive stick shift in a tiny 80s Honda Accord. That thing was so special. Honda really lost something over the years. Maybe this will be special but Im not holding my breath.
2854,Tales From the Loop has seen some good success as an alt-80s setting  and that era has been getting lots of love in and out of the rpg community thanks to Stranger Things for a little bit.  I think it could be cool  but I would lead more with the mechanics/gameplay (or at least that is what I find most compelling)
2855,"Tales of Arise.  It's okay. Definitely the best Tales game in a while  and the production value is WAY higher than I've seen since maybe Xillia.   The combat is the best Tales has been  probably ever (I remember really loving Graces F's combat  but this feels even better) and the characters are mostly pretty well defined and mostly enjoyable (though their negativity towards one another Definitely sours the adventure a bit).  The world is gorgeous  I just wish there was more of it. 30 hours in and the adventure has been about as ""adventurous"" as Final Fantasy XIII... beautiful world  but incredibly linear with only occasional branching paths that lead to dead ends with treasure chests.   The story is very ""dark"" for a Tales game  and it's just not sitting right with me. The subject matter is mostly about slavery and revolution  but it's handled in a way that just seems too simple. I know it's a stupid complaint but it's like I can't make up my mind if I can suspend my disbelief on some of the topics or not and certain actions just have me rolling my eyes.   Overall  there is A LOT of good here. But a better writing team could have turned this into something truly special and it's just not at that level. I didn't expect it to be Nier or even FF levels of story telling  but DQ11 is significantly more engaging and I guess I expected more than that.  So far  7/10  but this is a game thst has potential to really shine in the post game and I have a feeling when I get there I will enjoy it substantially more."
2856,Talking from experience  I once tried making something similar regarding complexity in c++.   If you're just wanting to learn  then OpenGL(+ SDL2  worked for me in the past)  and maybe search up a library that eases the pain a bit.   But if you want to make something that you want to publish  sell or make people play  there's a 99% chance you're wasting time  and again  I'm talking from experience. If you want to make it in c++ because of freedom  use the Godot Engine  which is 100% open source  no watermarks  nothing. And the engine is only a 20Mb file  it's amazing.
2857,Tartarus stuff was fine for me  you respawn on the ledge you fell off of. The screen flashes in the direction of whatever was activated by any switch  and they are all small as hell so it didn't take much to figure out anyway.   I thought the game was beautiful  but thats of course a matter of taste.   As you said  you can skip the animations for the upgrades  so that was pretty easy to overlook.   Sounds like you wanted the game to play itself? Idk
2858,Taumatawhakatangihangakoauauotamateaturipukakapikimaungahoronukupokaiwhenuakitanatahu.  85 letters. Its ~~city~~ the name of a  1000-foot hill in New Zealand  or at least it was in 2018. I remember seeing an article about it a few years ago  so I just googled longest town name and found an article about it written in 2018. It also shows up on a wiki.   Nope  I have no idea how to pronounce it. Id just have to go with Tauma.
2859,Tbf I've made the mistake of repairing my iphones myself more than once  only to realize that Apple would have changed them for a refurbished one for an extremely reasonably price  with the added benefit of new battery  new case...         That doesn't excuse them from pissing on the right to repair but yeah  don't repair your iphones  it's not worth it.
2860,Tbh any looter shooter MMO when youre past the early levels is half-brain piloted. I play Genshin and Warframe and I almost always have something playing in the back while I do my business Im the games
2861,tbh if they want to punch throught they need to offer desktop (micro atx ?) mainboard. With swappable ddr4 ram  multiple sata/pci-e(/nvme?) connectors.  It's itx  so that's good but too small for most desktops. Also the ram is soldered. Also  there's only one pci-e and no sata. That mean having to pick between the GPU and a sata controller. Or using usb for storage.  > For those wondering about the PCI Express 3.0 x16 slot  it's limited to x8 lanes but can drive a graphics card. SiFive's documentation lists the Radeon HD 6000 series (not to be confused with the current RX 6000 series) and RX 500 (Polaris) series as being supported  Why can't they just properly implement pci-e to allow every video cards to work properly ffs. Do they need a binary translation layer in firmware to allow to boot firms for x86 mbs ?  > NVIDIA graphics are obviously unsupported until if/when they release a RISC-V Linux driver.  nouveau exist in kernel (let alone VESA); they can just use that... tho the 3d performances [are shit and a borderline joke](https://i.imgur.com/oxrg6qc.jpg)  it shouldn't blackscreen. This is a design issue.
2862,Technically yes  but in the first two episodes he just casually mentioned it once and it hasn't come up at all  they didn't show his previous life or anything.  Maybe it will come up later in the series  but for now it is really just a regular fantasy series like DanMachi or Grand Blue Fantasy
2863,Tedious most of the time with loads of things to remember. I think I'll post a question around how people remember what they do. That's a struggle for me having gone from reading several books to learn c++ to try games from scratch using dx9 API  to java for Android  to c# for unity  and finally to blueprints in UE4's relatively foreign environment. No wonder I haven't released anything yet! Hahaha *cries lol
2864,Tempted? All the time.   Actually *do* it? Sometimes. Almost always after we've completed a satisfying arc in our current game.   To the annoyance of the players? Not at all. My group *likes* switching systems.
2865,Terminator Cobras. When I was in highschool $15-$25k got you a nice one. After highschool when I got my first job  $25-$30k. Now a Terminator Convertible with peeling paint is like $35k. A good one is almost 40k  and a black coupe in good condition is $45k  My buddy bought an 07 GT500 for $45k. Dealers are now asking $60k for 07-09 and 90k for 2013-2014 GT500s.   I'm in Canada BTW so prices are CAD.
2866,Terrible placement for an F150 advertisement: right in the middle of a list of 10 vehicles with highest DUIs. That said  it's surprising to see that the best selling vehicle in America isnt on the list.
2867,Tesla probably doesn't care  because the 3 and the Y are their moneymakes.  They've sold more of those than Porsche has sold vehicles by a factor of 4 (looking at the wikipedia sales figures for 2020 for both companies). I think at this point the Tesla S is essentially their advertising car  where they get public interest from stupid 0-60 times and fart noises  but they aren't expecting big sales of the model directly.
2868,"Thank God for that! It is so much more relaxing to drive on unrestricted Autobahn - especially in moderate traffic where the ability to drive fast allows you to negotiate traffic much more safely and efficiently than the ""Elefantenrennen"" that often result when the limit is 130km/h or below.   Driving fast is already ""penalised"" by the high fuel prices  just as it should be. I lose 80% fuel efficiency when going at top speed compared to 140. It is prohibitively expensive  but I love that I have the opportunity to drive fast  should the need be there."
2869,Thank you Doga Kobo for airing this cuteness overload on Saturdays. Watching Futaba's cute annoyance at her bro senpai Takeda is the perfect antidote to the depression that is Eighty Six.  Don't worry Futaba  Kazama did notice you've put on (teddy bear) paddings  though of course he was too gentlemanly to mention it to you.  Futaba's grandpa is not only a muscular badass  he's voiced by THE Otsuka Akio  the Japanese Solid Snake. God knows who would win between Futaba's grandpa and Takeda.  Meanwhile  another ship seems to be sailing  Kazama and Sakurai looks as though they're childhood friends for Sakurai to warm up so quickly to Kazama.
2870,Thanks for bringing the Cowboy Bebop rpg to my attention!   I'm a fan of anything fun and engaging. Been playing 5e for a while. Dabbled a little in Degenesis. Super stoked for Avatar (as is my son). Now I'm excited to learn more about Cowboy Bebop. I've looked into Blades and it seems great and a lot of people really love it  but getting my 5e group to pivot to a different game has been difficult.
2871,"Thanks for linking this video  I hope it helps to bring more viewers into Sreten's channel.  I've been watching him since the beginning of his Youtube days and have shared his content with every car person I know.  For some reason the YT algorithm doesn't push his channel out a lot.  I love his dry humour  how ""real"" he is and the meticulously correct work he does on his cars."
2872,Thanks for the feedback  everyone. I gave a quick look to the **Player's Survival Guide**  and the system looks quite interesting.  I agree that sticking to the Stress mechanism make the game more suitable for one-shots  which is the perfect choice when it comes to settings-light games.  The Kickstarter boxed-set campaign may probably include plenty of modules  thus expanding the lore and the settings of the PSG (or at least this is what I suppose)  so I might give it a try  as it definitely seems quite worth it.
2873,Thanks for the review from a Panama buyer perspective. I reside in Canada where Mitsubishi is a small player  but I agree with a lot of things you said.  My old man is quite a penny pincher and defines value as getting the most from his money. Naturally Toyota  Honda and even Subaru didn't match up against Mitsubishi from this perspective  which is why he is on his 2nd Outlander.  The car definitely is built as a cruiser and very soft  but this is how he like the car and has plenty of space for his things.
2874,Thanks for this! The bit about the Chinese localization was particularly interesting to read about.  What do you feel kept the game from having higher sales early on? Do you think that it was primarily held back by not being on Steam and the other storefronts?
2875,Thanks to a goofy autosave I was locked into an impossible fight about 45 mins in while roaming around one of the early maps - that was it for me. From what I've read many folks have had similar issues  lost saves  etc.  Up to that point  though  I was having a pretty good time with it. But I had already restarted twice before so that was enough for me.
2876,"That ""Input"" is a separate class that comes with Unity and as the name suggests  it handles inputs. You can define different inputs in Unity editor under Project Settings > Input Manager. You'll notice that there are already ""Horizontal"" and ""Vertical"" axis defined. That's where the name that your looking at comes from."
2877,that 15% will only be in certain scenarios  where current cache isn't sufficient for that specific workload. Otherwise  there will be no difference  heck  maybe it will even slow down  because there will be higher latency on the L3 cache  it being bigger.
2878,That 3070ti placement really does drive home that this card only exists because of the current market being fucked.  I absolutely hate how this garbage card is actually good value right now. In any other market it'd be DOA  but nooo  now its like  actually decent to buy and I hate it.
2879,"That being an SOL is an excuse to introduce story elements and not do anything with them.  That ""anime is just advertising for the source material"" is an excuse for shows having shit endings that leave you hanging."
2880,That comparison of Sun to the Earth has to be one of the funniest breast size comparison jokes I've seen in a while hahaha.  Then I saw the men just bending on their backs to stare at the other's breasts a while longer... Kazama's head turning in shock at the fake breasts... Anime really has a way to revitalize that kind of humor  doesn't it?
2881,That drive that got you into web & design will drive you through games. I promise! I was exactly the same. What aspect is it you are having the most trouble with? The programming fundamentals for C# can be quite jarring compared to something so loosely typed like JavaScript.
2882,"That earth and sun  and the whole bear thing being a pad was so funny i couldn't stop laughing.  Igarashi  after being saved by senpai from a pervert  still thinks he doesn't see her as a woman? She's putting too much thoughts into it.  And as expected  big people like takeda knows judo. I've seen it coming when the guy tried to attack him.  Kazama is just the opposite of the legendary kazuma. That call was so sweet. As much as i like the main couple  i think I'm more looking forward to this 2nd couple.  That smile on sakurai when asking kazama out too  she must be protected. I wonder how the co worker will feel tho if they ever find out lol.  Igarashi""s friend is a gyaru who likes running. I think I'm gonna need more of her life story too.  A great epi  and another epi to remind us how single we are."
2883,"That job description is not entry level. Just this on its own requires experience:  ""Own the compliance testing process and pipeline for the game team.""  To do that you need to know how MS  Sony and Nintendo do their compliance. I've only personal  direct experience of Nintendo's compliance process  but that was an experience going through that. We had to do a lot of learning on that project ;)  Some of the other items in there are pretty major as well.  Just nit-picking here  but I'd also personally question the phrasing of this item:  ""Ensure our game products meet high standards of quality  reliability  usability  and performance through hands-on testing and problem reporting.""  As a QA analyst  you cannot ensure a product meets X standard of quality - because in all likelihood you do not decide what bugs are fixed and what are not. Therefore you cannot be held responsible for that. You CAN be held responsible for putting in place testing plans that should find bugs  but you CAN'T be held responsible for reaching X quality because you don't decide what bugs are fixed.  Not sure any of this help though ;)  EDIT: QA/QC tester is a common entry method into the game industry. To move out into other jobs  for example design or code  you need to learn those skills (some studios will help you here). QA/QC is a particularly popular entry method into production jobs. Anecdotal example  but I had lunch with 3 other prod folks today. 2 of them started in QC."
2884,That sounds like an awesome idea for a game. Not sure what system would work though as there are two genres there.  Personally I'd probably try to find a system you like to adapt to it rather than making a bespoke system.
2885,That was a good episode  from initial grim comedy narration  through great battle scenes and animal folk admitting they were wrong to the grim reminder that situation back home is bad  RIP grandpa Greyrat even if Rudeus's *could it be* about nobles buying kids was an unfortunate reminder
2886,That was me for a while.  My advice is to just do it.  Do everything you need to and prepare a session for the other game and just say you're gonna do a oneshot once you're ready.  See how it goes.  I suggest watching at least one live play  just to get an idea of how someone else paces the game.
2887,That was quite a blast.  I wonder if there will ever be something that mah boy Goemon won't be able to cut. Today armored cars  maybe tomorrow actual mountains.  The car chases in Lupin III are never dull  and even if we get some CG involved in them  in my books they still look splendid. The motorcycle chase was simply phenomenal.  I need to hear more of Ootsuka Akio voicing Jigen in order to settle down and accept the torch has been passed down.  Short hair and glasses Fujiko was something I wasn't ready for.  [](#assman)  On the newer cast  Sherlock does already look like a very interesting character  safekeeping Lily and it will be quite interesting to see his story involving Lupin in the rest of this arc. Lily is incredibly adorable  I'm not expecting her role to be as relevant as Ami's was back in part V  but I'm hoping to be amazed along the way.
2888,That was quite insightful  and generous of you to share. Also very interesting the dynamic of discounted price and regional sales numbers. I'm not a Dev  but would have loved to see the drilled down numbers to specific countries  but understand that may not be possible due to some agreements. According to sales numbers you see  which countries do you see emerging markets for indie gaming- in other words  did you see sales in a particular country ramping up in recent years  when it was not the case before?
2889,That's a lot of players for a game I've never heard of. Any chance anyone could explain if this game is worth playing  and what it's about? I could Google it  but I'd rather hear from people who have been looking forward to it for a while or are already playing it.
2890,That's an amazing game... not sure how it holds up due to it being so old now  20 years? My best recommendation is use what you learned from how you played mass effect... all kinds of codex entries for xp and side quests if you look   you control your team in a similar way  it's a little more KOTOR esque...  But yeah if you played ME and KOTOR play this like them and you should be good.
2891,That's awesome! I did the porsche european delivery program for my 911  and taking it to 180 mph on a destricted autobahn section with basically no traffic is one of my most memorable moments in the car. Irrelevant  but pics of that rs2 in your flair?
2892,That's big news! Gaming industry workers face some truly awful working conditions  both in the tabletop and video gaming spheres. Here's hoping their efforts lead to better working environments within and outside of Paizo.
2893,"That's it. Your mileage will suffer and performance as well. The ECU will ""detune"" to keep things running. Any monetary gains from using the cheaper fuel will be essentially null.   Of course the dealer told you that it doesn't matter. They want you to buy that car."
2894,That's just how it is to learn something new. I do back end dev and I made a game in my spare time in college.   Now 10 years later I'm teaching myself JavaScript and reactjs by making a kanban/Todo board and it just took me a week to follow tutorials just to get to a point I could make a form that creates and saves tasks that can be shown on the main page. Working on front end just doesn't click for me
2895,That's literally as far as I made it  once I unlocked it I was so caught up in getting the kingdom management part perfect that I didn't do anything and that's where my save file has been sitting ever since.
2896,That's not just possible  it's commonly done for drag racing  especially with 80s or 90s V8 cars like the Mustang or Corvette.  Your average drag racer would have a Mustang with a 302 or 351 engine with upgraded internals and some form of forced induction (turbo- or supercharger)  and the Corvette would most likely have some flavor of smallblock Chevy engine with the same treatment. A car like that would be perfectly capable of keeping up with a modern supercar  in terms of acceleration over a short distance at least.  A car that's also supposed to be good on the street or a road course would likely have a different upgrades  like a more modern engine (Coyote V8 for the Mustang  Chevy LS V8 for the Corvette) and different suspension.
2897,That's quite impressive  though it's obviously just one very specific workload.  The success (or lack thereof) of Alder Lake and big/little in general across a variety of game benchmarks (especially regarding frametime stability) will be extremely interesting to see. Some of the most exciting times in PC CPUs in a long while!
2898,That's screwed up. In Arizona it'd be downright convenient to build a massive solar array or mirror farm  and even if that electricity wasn't directly used in the plant itself it could be sent to Phoenix.  TSMC has built some truly elaborate water recycling facilities at its Taiwan plants  a solar farm would be much more straightforward (and profitable at the bottom line) by comparison.
2899,"that's the biggest thing:  > And should i just play them just too have them played?  THAT has changed the most in my old age. When I was younger it was ""CONSUME ALL THE GAMES AS FAST AS POSSIBLE."" Part of that may have been keeping up with the joneses  but I had the drive and the desire to just play everything. Now I'm very selective with my time and energy. I'll usually focus on one maybe two games with a side game or two at most that's played with friends  like Dota or Warzone.  I know you said you can't stand MMO RPGs but man has FFXIV taken up my time lately. Former WoW addict trying something new and I'm loving it. That's my focus game right now with my 2nd being Kingdom Two Crowns (damn that game just scratches all my ADHD itches at once). And once I'm through that content  I'll move on to new focuses.   RPGs in general tend to be slower burns with more satisfying ""journeys"" than other games. They scratch that itch very well for a game that can keep your attention for a long time and give your brain a story and/or a workout to get through. My favorite genre for a long time  but even more so now a days :) Keep on enjoying!"
2900,Thats the most stupid excuse Ive ever heard.  I wouldnt even bother to go there anymore and have them fix it. Find a different Shop  the one she was at obviously cant be trusted to be decent human beings. Not worth the fight over a tire Job imo.  There is so such thing as too good tires. You can drive a Prius on racing Tires and all that will happen is it will handle better.  Struggling to put the power down would be too little grip. From this guys logic it would mean that not spinning the wheels when accelerating is somehow bad for the car?  If it gets worse as the car gets faster there is only 2 possible issues: they fucked up the alignment or they didnt balance the weight of the wheels properly.
2901,Thats wonderful.. The problem I have has been climbing the barrier in the first place. I have 1 player who is in his early 30s and started playing with us at age 17.. its more about getting past that early attitude..   Its not always there.. but its very common.. speaks more to the individuals maturity levels than anything.  Those playing 5e from the beginning have no other frame of reference.. so i get it.. its just generational boundaries have proven tricky..at least for myself..
2902,The 13th Age Book of Ages has you generate the prior ages by tracking the rise and fall of various peoples and groups. It also has an emphasis on creating content that will be relevant in the present day.
2903,The 2003 Jaguar XJ Super V8 I had for a few months. Stunning vehicle and had a super charged V8. It wad great but EVERYTHING broke on it. I really tried saving it but at the end I just gave up on it...
2904,The 3nm delays were writing on the wall for people following the TSMC and their biggest clients. Its just now TSMC is finally publicly saying it instead of lying through their teeth about being on schedule with no issues.  The 3nm stumble is exactly what Samsung and Intel wanted. However as we know Samsung is also facing its own node issues as of recent  so its kind of moot for them.  Ultimately Intel seems like the big winner here if they can keep to their schedule  which admittedly they havent in the last few years under previous CEOs.  If Intel can execute their roadmap  they should be able to *at least* meet TSMC in 2025  but Intel might be celebrating far before 2025:  With AMD getting 2nd or 3rd dibs on the latest node (After Apple and other mobile manufacturers)  it means that in 2023 Intel 4 Meteor Lake may very well go up against AMD Zen 5 on ... TSMC N5P  instead of the originally planned N3. Which would be terrible news for AMD and amazing for Intel  since the companies would be releasing products on similar nodes for once.    TLDR; TSMC delays mean a huge shakeup not only at the foundry level but for CPUs too. Things are going to get really competitive again.
2905,the 5 cylinder engine in VW group cars since the 2000s have been very reliable and are now becoming more common in the modding game  not to mention a factory 400hp version in the TTRS and RS3. People swap the iron block jetta engines into sport quattros nowadays.
2906,"The ability to learn both depends on you. Do you have any programming experience? if not  I'd maybe just learn Python. It'll help to learn ANY language when it comes to learning programming in general.   Python isn't ""bad"" it's just not really ideal for a lot of game development. It is however a useful language so it's not gonna hurt to learn it.  I'd learn Python  then go from there. It's not like you need to take 20 years to learn a language."
2907,"The absolute fucking abysmal state of games ""journalism""  is succinctly demonstrated in the first paragraph of this barely coherent ""article"":  > A bunch of experts were able to play Obsidian's new RPG Avowed. No  we were not amongst them  and now  we don't want to talk about  and  yes  we still consider ourselves experts... but that's besides the point. The point is that everyone agrees that Avowed is amazing. You can almost say they all vowed on it... heh... (sorry).  What The Fuck?  Game looks fine  tho."
2908,The AC Delco division of GM has always made top notch parts. I would never shy from buying them. That doesn't mean that every engineering group at GM is good. Look at the 80s.  (I had an 82 T/A)  Now  modern day GM  I wouldn't have any problem buying their mid and high tier products  based on quality. But I think you can get better bargain elsewhere.
2909,The action is top notch. I really love how you can feel the tension when Rudeus faces someone he knows can kill him in a flash. The eye helps a lot  but just because you know something is coming doesn't mean you can react to it in time. Must be really shitty knowing you're about to get stabbed.
2910,The age of a character depends on the time passed in universe  not how much time has passed in real life.  If a character is 16 in universe and time has not passed there  she'll still be 16 no matter how many real life years passes.
2911,The alternator is rated for the worst case scenario of a heavily drained battery that needs to be charged quickly  all accessories and lights on  and engine running at idle spinning the alternator well below its optimal speed. In that case you might have 80A available from a 150A nominal alternator  with the battery sinking 30.  When your battery is close to fully charged and only taking a few amps  and not all your gadgets are on  then yes your alternator is much larger than needed  but that's not the situation they design for.
2912,The always the modern lite design defining classic [Lasers and Feelings](http://www.onesevendesign.com/laserfeelings/). Worth looking at at least since it's literally only one page  but might be too simple for what you're looking for. Ideal for one-shots.
2913,"The answer is No and Yes. [Here is a comparison calculator to use.](https://tiresize.com/comparison/)  * If the **total** diameter of the wheel and tire changes the answer is yes  the speedometer changes. * If the **total** diameter of the wheel and tire **does not** change the answer is no  the speedometer doesn't change.  example: A change from 225/65R1**6** to 225/60R1**7** is a change in diameter of 0.1"" (2.5mm)  the speedometer isn't changing on you.  Generally speaking you need a change greater than 1"" (25mm) to start impacting the speedometer in a way you might want to pay attention. At around 2"" (50mm) of change you start getting several MPH off."
2914,The architecture never really changed after Skylake  but the 14nm process got a lot more refined. Stock boost clocks were well past 4ghz  and certain models like the 9900KS came from the factory running 5ghz on all 8 cores.
2915,The article says that 4 in 5 electronics manufacturers makers say its hard to find qualified workers. Would be nice to see some of the job descriptions included with the articles. The worker shortage always seems to be reported from the employers view. The articles never seem to ask the elusive potential workers for their 4 out of 5 job applicants stories.  Thanks for the downvote. That will certainly get the discussion going to solve the problem.
2916,The beginner boxes for the current line of Star Wars games (Edge of the Empire  Age of Rebellion  Force & Destiny) are intended to take you from opening the box to playing within a short while. I ran them for many years on weekly new player days at my FLGS and found that people usually grasped the dice mechanics within a few minutes and understood the game as a whole soon after.      The system itself is built to be narrative forward and in the low to mid range of mechanical heaviness. If you want to play with heavy roleplay  it certainly supports that  most of my tables are roleplay heavy.      Caveat of course that liking the IP would be important.
2917,"The beginning in this case could refer to the formation of the laws of the world  or it could refer to the first sapient life  or anything in-between.  I had a thought. I often build my worlds starting at the latest point in the timeline: the start of the campaign. But I'm thinking that perhaps the world would feel (and maybe *be*) a lot deeper and richer if I did a simulation of the world  developing its history starting at the beginning and stopping at the ""modern time."" (""Modern"" meaning the start of the campaign.) I'd end up with organically-made eras  ruins  history  and all that jazz.  **I could just make it up as I go along  but do you know of any tools or supplements for helping this?**  I know of Lame Mage Productions' Microscope (and their other projects) but Microscope's a collaborative (I'd rather go about this alone) and non-chronological system.  And of course  there's also the issue of keeping the target campaign system in mind. And also  it's just a complex thing overall  with tons of facets that you may forget about."
2918,The belt for my Trailblazer is a PITA if I forget the part number. For some reason all the parts store/RockAuto databases sort by alternator rating. What they apparently don't know is that when you go from LWB to SWB on the GMT360s it's the A/C compressor pulley that changes not the damn alternator pulley.   There are different sizes of U-joints as well but those are a tad easier to figure out. Also the high-mount brake light and housing changed from neon to LED after 2004 so if you have a 2003/2 model you have to order the whole brake light surround as well as the light.
2919,The benefit of a hatch is being able to fold the rear seats down and turn it into a wagon. I can get 10 foot lumber (12 if I'm feeling frisky) in my Speed 3 with the seats folded. Just have to stick it out the passenger window.
2920,The best solution I have seen to this issue was Assassins Creed: Origins  which allowed a player who had completed the game to start a new game at or near max level without relying on a NG+ load out system.    I agree that content is important  but I in general prefer to have at least one playthrough where leveling is taken out of it.  Fundamentally  I think levels are archaic and obsolete.  NG+ is a sticking point for me.
2921,The best working and most famous system from detailed media is the Pendragon TTRPG. Going through a mix of all the Arthurian Mythos stories  giving the players the chance to either opose King Arthur  join him... or overrule him if they are skilled enough.
2922,The big concepts come easy. We all have a million ideas. It's all the details and fine-tuning that take time and effort. And probably the most important thing is to leave your ego at the door. If you're making a game just for yourself  that's one thing. But if you're making a game you want other people to enjoy then you need to be able to listen to them. Then you have to find that fine balance of listening to what people say  while still staying true to your ideas. But first  listen.
2923,The biggest struggle I've found with art is the sheer amount of time it takes. If you have the time  art is essentially just putting the correct colors in the correct pixels...just takes a long time to make
2924,The Bladurs Gate series was my first real exposure to western RPGs  though in my case I played lots of D&D already. They are still probably my favorites in the genre but they do require a proper mindset. You need to get used to save scumming constantly  especially in the early going of BG1. It also helps to have a passing familiarity with stuff like THAC0. Essentially you want your AC to be low and your THAC0 to be high.   I would also recommend that you dont start out with a magic character like a mage or druid. The density of spells is the BG games can be overwhelming especially for D&D noobs. You can blunder through it on lower difficulty though.  Its totally worth the trouble too. The first game has low stakes at the beginning and lots of wandering about clearing wilderness areas. I personally find it a little meditative  the kind of thing I enjoy with a TV show in the background. About 2/3 of the way in the story really revs up. BG2 is far better paced and almost universally regarded as the better game  and it definitely is. But dont sleep on the beginning. Its also really good and its low level adventure lends lots of context and meaning to the whole experience.
2925,The breakthrough moment between my beginner understanding of programming and code and moving into game development happened when I was a teenager.  I joined a small development team who was working on an unofficial sequel to a game. The project never saw the light of day  but it was a huge learning experience.  Game design has become much easier today than it's ever been in the past. Because of new tools like Unity  Godot  or Unreal Engine  you can create games as long as you understand how to work with their software within their framework.  Back in the day I learned from the ground up  starting with game mods.  My first ever mod was a sticky smoke grenade that spewed out a range of different colours. It was a community sandbox game that I won't name. The next step to me would be understanding how engines are designed  and how to create a framework within a simple graphics+sound+physics engine.  The team I worked with was great. We had an experienced software engineer walk us through step by step how to complete different aspects of our projects.  Asides from game logic  he taught us how to structure our logic. The basis of most game design is to create a handler for your logic within a group. We would create an event handler  a dialogue handler  a UI handler  a sound handler  and so forth. Using libraries like OGRE3D or Irrlicht  we learned how to create things from the top down in a barebones environment to take the confusion out of it.  Modern game dev is a treat when the majority of your logic is Class/Object-oriented and full of inheritance.  Keep your chin up! I've been learning since I was a kid and I still haven't made my own game.
2926,The cancellation of D&D 3.5.  I had invested a lot of money and time into that system and I enjoyed the wide array of options  and crunch  that it offered.  When 4e came out I tried it  and did not much care for it  so as soon as Pathfinder released I immediately ran to that system.  I have tried so many other game systems over the years  but for some reason none stick with me like Pathfinder does.  Now I run Pathfinder 2e  which gives me a stronger appreciation for what they were doing with 4e.  The current D&D rules are both to vague and linear for me to ever find myself using that system ever again.
2927,The caveat here is that the game has to support it. As they showed with Witcher 3  Flight Sim and a few others some games simply don't care about SAM/ReBar.  Edit: For anyone with a Gigabyte Aorus motherboard it's under Settings - IO Ports - ReBar Support
2928,The Challenge Stradale  Looks to kill for.  Exhaust note to die for.  great handling and decently fast  that is when the thing is running.  when it doesn't break down on the road (2x) and gawkers drive around pointing and taking picture of the broken down Ferrari.  don't get me started on the sticky buttons.  Ferrari knows about this but they don't care.  costs an arm for regular maintenance.  Throw in a leg if something goes wrong - which it does at a frequent interval.
2929,The chipset was apparently going to be made by AMD as well  but Microsoft had to sell it off to a neutral party during the Intel switch. That party ended up being Nvidia  paving the way for nForce chipsets  which started out as AMD-only  because the Xbox chipset used Microsoft's P6 bus license.
2930,The comments on the C&D Article are hilarious. GM continues to once again deliver basically everything enthusiasts have been asking for in a reasonably priced package  yet the comments are flooded with people nitpicking about the interior and complaining about how the 4.0 second 0-60 in a MANUAL test car isn't good enough in this day and age.   This and the CT5 truly are special cars. They are essentially a modern American interpretation of what the golden age of BMW was. The German competitors have become bloated and numb while Cadillac has honed in on what really matters in a sports sedan. I even think the interiors are pretty damn good  especially compared to past Cadillac performance cars. The digital gauge cluster and HUD look great  as do the seats and steering wheel. Really proud of what Cadillac accomplished with these cars.
2931,The content warning for Boyfriend Dungeon inadequately describes the events of stalking and emotional manipulation that exist in the story. We'll update the game next week with a more accurate CW. We apologize for any hurt inflicted by our mistake. Thank you for playing!  ***  posted by [@KitfoxGames](https://twitter.com/KitfoxGames)  ^[(Github)](https://github.com/username) ^| ^[(What'snew)](https://github.com/username)
2932,The coolant I certainly wouldn't do yet. I might not wait until that super high interval they recommend but you've still got a *long* ways to go.  Brake fluid should ideally be flushed every 2 years on street driven cars so you might be due for that one.
2933,The courses you're looking for are usually reserved for post graduate degrees  at least it is for my university.  Plan to stay in school past your bachelor's degree to get into those fields out of school. As has been said  GPUs are a subset of a larger field. You might find out there are other areas you may like other than the GPU field
2934,"The CRPG ""Dragon Age Origins"" might be a good middle ground between ARPG's like Skyrim  and full blown ""old school"" styled CRPG's.  DAO is more complex when it comes to building your character and in combat  than the games you mentioned... but is a bit simpler than games like ""Pillars of Eternity""  ""Divinity Original Sin""  and the ""Pathfinder"" games  which can all be very complex with this (especially character creation  and character building through the game).  &#x200B;  As for combat  it is real time with pause (pretty common i CRPG's really  some are turn-based though). Where if you want to micromanage your companions actions in combat  you will need to use the pause option to give orders to everyone... since going real time all the time can make it a bit to hectic to micromanage all 4 party members.  But if you do not want to micromanage them all in combat as much  and just take care of your main character (or one of the others in the team) in combat  then there is a ""Tactics system"" in the game where you can put together a pretty simple AI thing with how each of the characters in your party act on their own in combat (watching/reading a tutorial for the Tactics system might be a good idea though  for the more complex aspects of using the Tactics system effectively).  To use the Tactics system to it's fullest though  you do have to as you play increase each companions Cunning to 16  and invest up to 4 points into the skill ""Combat Tactics"" on each of them as well. If you find that to be acceptable  so you do not have to micromanage combat as much  and you focus hard and put points into these things as fast as possible  then each character should have maxed out the skill ""Combat Tactics"" somewhere between level 4 and 12 (lvl depends on if it is MC or a companion  which class they are  and if they start with a points in ""Combat Tactics"" or not).  &#x200B;  And when it comes to the camera in DAO  you can keep it zoomed out to be more similar to games with an isometric viewpoint... or zoom in and be closer to 3rd person. There is no 1st person view though."
2935,The CT4 & CT5 won't be long for this world - in Toronto the German big 3  Lexus  Acura and even Volvo have no problems moving their sedans  but I don't remember the last time I saw a newer Cadillac sedan driving around.   Heck at one point in time I wanted to shop around for a CT4-V (the non-Blackwing version) but it might as well NOT EXIST in GM stores in Canada.  GM done a great job at tuning the Alpha platform siblings  but the fact of the matter is they haven't solved the fundamental problem why the ATS & CTS never matched the 3 series/A4 and 5 series/E-class.
2936,The DDICs which drives the panels  most of the time in context of OLED screens  have DACs which drive the pixel voltages. Most of the time the DAC bit-depth is either 8- or now sometimes 10-bit. This is merely to be able to be able to produce 255 / 1024 steps of colour graduation.  The issue with DC dimming is that on top of the DACs controlling colour  they need to vary it over different global luminosity levels as well. This vastly increases the DAC bit-depth requirements  and there's only very few which are able to do this.  In order to create graduations both in terms of colour levels as well as brightness levels  PWM is added in. PWM modulation is essentially just on/off or a 1-bit modulation on top of the 8/10-bit DACs that drive the pixel matrix. This is vastly easier to achieve than having extremely high bit-depth DACs which can use a lot of power or are hard to manufacture  or they are too slow to be able to be both precise and swing their voltages for all the pixels on the panel at reasonable refresh rates.  Current DC dimming have great drawbacks  especially in low luminosity levels- you're essentially clamping the colour resolution the lower brightness you go  and you can have effects such as colour banding or you actually see unevenness in the voltage drive across the panel which appears as blotches.  This generally isn't as much an issue on LCD panels as the backlight is driven by a different voltage than the pixel matrix  so the DAC bit-depth doesn't overlap or do double duty  but for OLEDs it's an inherent issue due to the self-emissivity of the pixels.
2937,"The deepest and most involving story I ever played was Planescape: Torment and that was decades ago. I played it once and never since. It still stands as the pinnacle of story telling in games for me.  My most played games are all MMOs and dungeon crawlers. My current favourite MMO is FFXIV but the problem with that is for me the only draw is the story. I don't do the mount farms or ""challenge"" myself with harder difficulty endgame stuff. So right now I'm playing Path Of Exile which feeds that part of me that needs to be switched off.  I have actual issues with ""thinking"" too much (worrying about shit I can't change) so I need games that will switch that part of me off for a while.  FFXIV and in fact most MMOs don't have that so when the story is done I play my diablo clones and single player games. I wish FFXIV had a diablo clone style minigame - I'd be a pig in muck lol and for me the life of the game would be massively extended.  You can only play through a story so many times before you get bored. So  games that do incorporate side quests and repeatable quests (like Div2) do provide extra value for some people.  I get what you're saying that some games are just providing the ""filler"" content instead of story and that sucks hard  but the only way to stop devs and publishers is to not buy those games every year.  There is a new Far Cry coming which is starting to feel like a regular paint by numbers release. I'm not buying it at release and will wait for reviews before I buy it  but too many of us still preorder games."
2938,The Design Mechanisms d100 [Mythras Core Rules](https://www.drivethrurpg.com/product/191475/Mythras) has a [Mythic Rome](https://www.drivethrurpg.com/product/194489/Mythic-Rome) supplement  which takes place during the birth of the Roman Republic.  It promises to treat the subject with historical depth.  Green Ronin Publishing offers a d20 supplement [Eternal Rome](https://www.drivethrurpg.com/product/19451/Eternal-Rome) for 3.5E  if you want to stick with D&D rules.  John Harpers [AGON](https://www.drivethrurpg.com/product/328661/AGON) revolves around the heroic myths of Ancient Greece and has been quite well received.
2939,The Design Mechanism's Mythras and Chaosium's BRP/Call of Cthulhu both have historically oriented supplements for Rome  though I believe. They do have 'magic' to varying degrees if you want to do a fantasy game but you could probably leave that out.  GURPS has a lot of supplements for different periods  including Rome  that are historically oriented too  and are (from memory) more oriented toward letting you run a campaign with or without any magic.
2940,The desire to experience other systems and settings. D&D is good at some things  but not everything. That isn't to say I don't still play D&D. I also don't play only one other game/system. Think of the hobby as a buffet rather than ordering a single meal.
2941,The difference between a dream and a goal is a plan.  I made a financial plan at the age of 22 (7 years ago)  to buy my dream cars by age 30 (next year).   Ive pretty much met and exceeded those goals (blood sweat and tears) and put down the money to purchase it.   A lot of people called me stupid for putting this much into what they consider an appliance  but for me  its the reward of a well executed financial plan. My next plan is a family  and Ive allocated myself 6 years to achieve this goal (by age 35)  and ill reward myself with something when that is achieved.
2942,The difference between a Model S and a Taycan is nutty. The Model S is fast  really fast. That's about it. The interior  exterior  the fit and finish  it's all bad. When you factor the price point it is absolutely trash.  The Taycan is a car that is actually put together well and offers more than go fast in a straight line. It is objectively better in every way that could possibly matter. I don't even have to point out specifics because it is just all better.   The Model S looks like a 2001 Kia Rio next to the Taycan.
2943,The disk is probably in MBR instead of GPT. Windows got a built in tool to convert MBR partitions to GPT without formatting in any way. mbr2gpt.exe  mbr2gpt.exe /convert /allowfullOS  EDIT: with UEFI I meant GPT
2944,The E60 BMW M5 - v10 incredible sounding engine paired with a F1 derived transmission (yeah the manual is less problematic).    Id wager its BMW most unreliable  and high maintenance costing vehicle they ever made. I still want one though
2945,"The Earth - Sun shot was genius.  ""Onee-san"" = ""Gorgeous"" in these subs.  ""Cute bear buns"" - doesn't that mean those are food??  She should've gotten out of the train after those to walked in before the doors closed. I guess she was too panicked to think straight though. And Kazama's reaction at the whole scene was just hilarious.  Wow  MC's grandpa is the FMA teacher's husband (who dyed all his hair green for some reason).  Come on  there's no way that guy could've taken a shot up MC's skirt unless he either put the camera on the ground or his arms can stretch an extra foot or two.  Red & White Judo belt ... googling ... puts Senpai anywhere between 6th & 9th dan (out of 12)  which is probably impressive.  Kazama's nice call pays off! Sure  I'll ship these two."
2946,The easiest way is to just GM the game yourself.  If you already know the rules  and know how the game works  just tell people you want to run x system and you're looking for players. I can almost guarantee you'll be able to get at least a small group together.
2947,The Elder Scrolls - well up there in trying to create a living world  especially Daggerfall and Oblivion.  Ultima and Ultima Underworld - for the same reasons really.  I like Baldur's Gate  but it feels like such a shame that the characters don't really live with needs and schedules  etc. like in Dwarf Fortress or Ultima VII. It stops it having a more dynamic world like Mount & Blade for example.
2948,"The Elder Scrolls games come pretty close to this.   There is no morality system or ""good"" path -- but there are extra-evil things you can do like working with the Brotherhood -- and if you choose not to do them  you only lose out on their rewards -- there is no compensating perk for not going choosing the ultra-evil options."
2949,The fact that developers should market is common sense by now. There is hordes of stories on this very sub of developers who marketed and still failed.  I haven't published yet  so this is second hand knowledge.  &#x200B;  Timing is important  not too early or too late.. You must have something to show when you announce your game  trailers or gameplay.  It takes time to build a community.  You need a place to gather them  and something to offer them for hanging around on your forums. The closer your game is to publishing the more frequent you need them to visit.  Press kits are a must have. The media will ignore you if you don't have one  because there are tons of games to review with press kits.  First focus on getting at least a hundred downloads before getting streamers involved.  &#x200B;  From what I understand so many games release at once. On PC  Mobile  Console  and VR all of them are competing for the same players.
2950,The first Fire Emblem for GBA is a great starting point.  It includes a tutorial with a story that ties into the main game.   Every character has a fixed class and you aren't expected to get a ton of stats on each level up.    Shining Force 2 is a really low-stakes SRPG.  The protagonist has an Egress spell that lets you exit any map while keeping all EXP  respawning all enemies  and healing everyone who survived.    There is no permadeath.  If the hero dies  you have to restart the chapter  but you only lose money.  If allies die  you can pay to revive at churches.      The best way to access Shining Force 2 is the Sega Genesis Classics Collection.  This includes a built-in fast-forward/rewind function to speed up enemy turns and undo actions on your turn.
2951,The first half is Shin training on site with Eugene in the Vanagandr. And they adapt the jumping zero scene. Then the spearhead squad comes at the memorial landmark  which they rest there comrades dogtags and juggernauts. The next scene is Fido reunion which surprised them. The OST is great this scene.  The second half is about the real fight on the battlefield in Eugene perspective. Then he was saved by the new mobility type Reginleif. The CGI on the fight is good and the new drone is cool.   And the last part which is graphic than the LN and you can feel the sadness of the scene and how gruesome it is. Overall its great episode
2952,The first podcast I think of is [Fandible](https://fandible.com/). They've been playing as the same group since 2010/2011  so over 10 years now  and they often play one-shots in a multitude of systems alongside long-running games. I *adore* their characterization. Combat happens  but it often takes a backseat to looking for clues  dramatic speeches  sneaking around and attempting to bullshit their way past NPCs.      Not every show is a hit but a large number of them are - I heavily recommend their End of the World episodes where they play the same characters who experience a different apocalypse every time  as well as their Numenera Longshot  which is on a little bit of a hiatus now but had two really character-driven seasons with excellent character growth. Overall a great  well-rounded cast.
2953,The first Wolfenstein was boring as fuck  and I didn't bother with the others after seeing cringey bullshit like that pregnant lady gun fight and the expansion with the girl power twins. It's disappointing to hear that the same devs who mutilated that series might now be failing upwards into an even better IP.
2954,"The first/only game I've run is Sentinel Comics RPG. It's a very narrative game with pretty simple rules. Everything the players need to know can be summed up in about a page  and the rulebook does a great job of explaining how to make encounters at different difficulties.   The only thing I've struggled with is making enough twists. In SCRPG  the environment gets a turn along with players and enemies  and the environment is supposed to introduce a twist. Twists can also be caused by players trying to overcome challenges and not rolling high enough. There's supposed to be some collaborative storytelling to figure out what kind of twist happens  but if your players are the kind to just look at the GM and go ""tell me what happens now"" then you can wind up frantically trying to think of a twist that isn't already part of the scene.  But that's a tiny problem in an overall excellent game."
2955,"the game is garbo  1. The story is cookie cutter  boring and has nothing unique about it.  2. Questing is dogshit where you keep doing the same quests over and over but in different settlement. You can even get the same quest from multiple settlements.  3. The majority of the time grouping up with friends when you first start the game requires a lengthy work around that the majority of players don't even know about. This is an MMORPG why should players jump through hoops to play with each other from the very start?  4. You can't share quests with friends and the majority of the time you can't even get the same quests as friends. This is an MMORPG why can't I get the same quests as my friends?  5. Character customization is dogshit. There are 9 year old games that have better character customization.  6. No UI customization or add-on support to customize the UI. 10 year old games have UI customization.  7. The per settlement economy is a bad idea. Eventually 1-3 settlements will be ""the"" trading settlements and the rest will be barren.  8. The per settlement storage is a bad idea because of the faction system  unless you are part of the controlling faction  it will make moving goods around be a complete pain in the ass just for the sake of it.  9. The faction/territory system will end up in a bad place when the majority of servers end up being the same faction.  10. Global locks on name and company forcing players to reserve names on EU servers to use in NA because EU servers went live first."
2956,"The Grand Tour then ""Top Gear"" ... got me a bit more open-minded to realize driving fast really was fun.  I also like engineering and physics.  ... but ... I still kind of hate cars. I've seen too much roadkill  including an ex-pregnant possum with five babies  one dying of sun exposure  maybe internal bleeding  not smushed like the other four babies; and poisonous headache-triggering exhaust  and noise  and social isolation  and inconvenience (being forced to use one everywhere for most of the USA) and severing one's connection with the planet  and bad drivers (again  unavoidable when you force all of society to drive a car individually with no public transit) ... ...  So basically Clarkson *et al.* (I actually like the other two more) got me to see that cars can be fun and enjoyable  even though they're dreadful tech I hope we move past."
2957,"The group I play with has tended to be that way  and honestly I'm getting pretty weary of it. I'd like to play one campaign for a long-ish time. We've done a few campaigns inside whatever system ""Shadow of the Demon Lord"" uses  so at least with those we had familiarity with the system. Like  there's a good bit of work that goes into getting familiar with a system. You've gotta read the book  figure out how the system generally works  figure out how characters work (edges  hindrances  feats  etc)  and then you're figuring out how combat works over a number of sessions. So like  if we do something for 10 sessions and then switch  we've just begun to really get comfortable."
2958,The hype and praise surrounding this game was insane during release. I had only played AC3 and Black Flag prior to Odyssey  but I knew this was a game I couldnt miss. This game is visually stunning and extremely well optimised on PC. The world is vibrant which enticed me to stop and appreciate its beauty.   I found the gameplay loop to be VERY addicting. I got seriously caught up in the loot system to equip myself with the best gear. The nemesis system was fun too  though 5 vs 1 is a bit much.  Thats pretty much where the praise stops.  I didnt find the characters compelling and this wasnt aided by Alexios forced voice acting  meaning I didnt care about the story. To make matter worse  this game is a GRIND and players are barred from progressing the main quests until they reach certain levels. The game forced me to complete side quests and conquest battles before being allowed to continue the story. These additional grind sessions can easily amount to 2 hours before knowing what gets the most XP. Its okay though  just buy XP boosters right? What a disgusting move by Ubisoft in a full $60 game.   After 40 hours  I was level 27 and had just reunited with mother. I was a few levels ahead actually so I could have easily played the next few main quests  but I was sick of it and quit the game entirely. The storytelling was SO BORING that the little impact it had could no longer hide the repetitive nature of the game. Loot this cave. Loot that quarry. Loot this bandit camp. Loot that fort. Hunt this uninspired animal. Blah blah blah.   I realised the only thing keeping me playing was the addictive nature of the loot system  not the story. I wont deny I had fun  but damn its a shallow experience that left me feeling unfulfilled by the end. This game is basically a glorified loot system with poor storytelling to cover it up.  Regardless  the experience leaves me more inclined to consider future AC games  but not with such a focus on loot and levelling.
2959,The iconic Keyblade wielder arrives to the battlefield.  Sora from \#KingdomHearts will be the final Super \#SmashBrosUltimate DLC fighter! Look forward to the release of Sora in Challenger Pack 11 on 10/18.   ***  posted by [@NintendoAmerica](https://twitter.com/NintendoAmerica)  Photos in tweet |  [Photo 1](http://pbs.twimg.com/media/FA8Px88X0AcccdP.jpg)   ^[(Github)](https://github.com/username) ^| ^[(What'snew)](https://github.com/username)
2960,The important bit that you will actually learn in CS are the fundamentals of computers  the programming language itself is just a tool for that. If you actually learn the fundamentals  learning another programming language becomes trivial  specially if we are talking about languages as similar as Python and C#.  So I'd just focus on Python for now  and once this course is over you will likely be able to learn C# by yourself with the skills you acquired.
2961,The issue I see is that gamedev for most people is simply a hobby (there is nothing wrong with this). Other hobbies like playing an instrument  painting minis  and restoring cars also take a lot of time to get good at and can also be very expensive. People dont normally expect these kinds of things to become their job though. There is an obsession in game dev with commercialisation that I dont think was always there. I think a lot of new devs would be happier (and possibly more productive) if their mindset and the culture in general embraced game dev as a hobby. There is no way I would learn piano for a year or two and then expect to earn a living from it.
2962,The issue is not that they're DnD. The real issue is that they're an adaptation of a  really old and fairly unforgiving version of DnD. Like you can make poor decisions at the start of the game when creating characters  and have no real way of recovering from them.  So it might be worth reading a spoiler free faq on character creation before starting.  That being said  the Baldur's Gate enhanced editions have difficulty settings. If you stick the games on the easiest settings  you won't need to know  much DnD at all to play them.  Especially if you play one of the easier to understand classes like fighter or paladin.
2963,The Juggernaut monument scene was one of my favorites in the LN because it shows that Shin's fallen comrades are not forgotten  and watching it play to a piano rendition of Avid in the anime was even better!  And man  Eugene's death... We LN readers all saw this coming but I think they really managed to capture how gruesome his condition was  and how tragic it was that Shin had to end his life. This adaptation continues amaze me!  Oh yeah  they're giving out free wallpapers of the characters. Just go [here](https://anime-86.com/defeat_legion/) and click on 'PRIZE'.
2964,The kingdom management is tiresome  and automating it is pretty buggy.  I enjoy the non-management stuff but having to deal with tons of generic events coming up prevents me from just traveling around and exploring.
2965,The Landmark Trust rent out historically interesting properties for holidays. Their catalogue has detailed floorplans of everything from Napoleonic forts to manor houses. Should be online these days. Also  National Trust (UK) should have such resources for all sorts of grand houses.
2966,The laptop doesnt detect its 5400 RPM 250GB HDD.  If I use this product:  https://www.amazon.com/dp/B00LS5NFQ2/ref=cm_sw_r_cp_api_glt_fabc_RN0FAW61R1Y1R5MH9QKG?_encoding=UTF8&psc=1  will it be able to read the data on the HDD? Even though my laptop (which is 11 years old) cant detect it?
2967,The Legend of Dragoon and Live A Live.    Still on disc 1 for LoD.  My first 4 party members all have their Power Ranger forms.    In Live A Live  I finished the chapters for the super robot  Street Fighter  cowboy  and caveman.
2968,The Legend of Dragoon on Vita.    I'm in the final dungeon and will probably finish tonight.    My final party is Dart/Miranda/Kongol.  I couldn't figure out the timing for Moon Blade or Blazing Dynamo  so Dart has been using the Ultimate WarGod trinket for autocombos.  Kongol has 40 reps in his last combo. Not sure if he will master it by the time I finish.    Miranda is used for spell nuking and so I only have to combo with one character.
2969,The Lexus model names apparently mean something.  IS = Intelligent Sedan (Intelligent Sports?)  ES = Executive Sedan  LC = Luxury Coupe  LS = Luxury Sedan  RC = Radical Coupe  RX = Radiant Crossover (not even kidding)
2970,The Link skills in Etrian Odyssey are my favorites.   The Landsknecht class excels at this.    A Link is an attack that triggers as a follow-up when an ally deals damage of the same element.  Flame Link adds a fire attack from the character who initiated the skill  every time another party member uses a fire spell or a fire-infused weapon  etc.  They can snowball into some devastating combos  but it takes a lot of commitment both in battle and in preparations.    Links can be boosted by passive skills that raise the max number of follow-ups per turn  make each follow-up deal more damage than the last  and increase the bonus for exploiting elemental weaknesses.   They can form the centerpiece of a party  as other characters dedicate their skills toward feeding more hits or making it safe to go all out.     The beauty of it all is that Links can make otherwise weak classes contribute to damage when they aren't needed for support.  Any source of damage can trigger a Link  whether the ally hit for 1000 or 1.    It's really satisfying seeing the damage build up in one turn.  The first hit in the combo might do 300 damage  then you start hitting for 30 000 toward the end.  Granted  it's a great way to die if you commit to a Link without setup.  Suppose you had every single character attacking  with nobody to heal or buff when it was needed.     IMO  the best skills need a risk-reward.  It can't just be free damage.
2971,The M1 Macbook Air is significantly faster in CPU  GPU  and ML  is cooler  has longer battery life  comes with 128GB more standard storage  and is $100 cheaper. You can get the MBA for $200 cheaper when it's frequently on sale for $899 on Amazon.  The 120hz display is nice but it only gets turned on when you're using the stylus or touch according to the article.  I can see if you want to use it as an tablet sometimes  then the MBA doesn't make sense for you.  For general office work or student work  the MBA seems much much better.  Also  128GB standard for $1 100? Come on Microsoft. That's ridiculous.
2972,The main challenge is that the game was rushed  so late game is imbalanced towards combat over stealth or diplomacy/seduction. Also  most people dislike the sewers/warrens as it's an onslaught of monsters  where players that are lacking in combat are subject to rage quit.
2973,The mana series (the gameplay was new and great music) The Suikoden series ( great story and it was so fun collecting the 108 stars of destiny characters.) The Xeno series (Xenogears and Xenosaga 1-3) (Interesting story and I loved the way science and religion played a huge role with overlying psychological themes). Last of all FF series  With the the exception of suikoden  my other favorites are all made by squaresoft or Square Enix.
2974,The market for British-era Land Rovers exploded during the pandemic. P38 Range Rovers have sold for upwards of $40k on BAT (and one even sold for $70k!)  something that previously would have gotten you laughed out of every Land Rover group in existence since $2-4k was the going rate for a long while and $10k was the *max* you'd spend for an absolute cream puff.  Porsche 996 Carrera 4S and Turbo values also shot up during the pandemic (along with 911s in general).  Needless to say that I'm not complaining.
2975,The Mary Skelter trilogy is definitely worth trying if you like DRPGs.  I liked Mary Skelter 1&2 a lot more than Labyrinth of Refrain.    Mary Skelter Finale just released for PS4 and Switch yesterday.  Advance Wars is good  but it's not an RPG.  There is no character progression.
2976,The Mary Skelter trilogy.  You can mix and match skills and stats between jobs.  Every few levels  your characters can unlock another job and level their skill tree anytime.  Then you can swap skills in and out  and pick which class determines your stats.   Each character also has her own Trance state with her own set of Limit Breaks.     The system feels like a mashup of Final Fantasies 5  9  and X-2.
2977,The mascot system really does seem disgusting. Sending little girls alongside a squadron to forcefully build bonds so they'll fight harder to protect them is very manipulative. I'm glad they said it's a dying custom. Cracks in the Giad Federacy are starting to show and maybe it's not as perfect as it first appears.
2978,the model S is not cool to have anymore. i mean its been out for like 10 years already. people want the latest and greatest. specially people with affluence. they want to be seen driving what just came out.  how much you wanna bet the majority of recent model S sales have been for the plaid because thats the only model in the model S line that is cool.
2979,"The moment Eugene kept going on and on about how he wants to take his sister somewhere when he takes his next leave i was like mentally shouting at the screen saying ""dude stop  you may aswell be having the angel of death flying over your shoulder""  i honestly feel bad about it but i burst into laughter when the very next frame showed his hand on the ground on what looks like the aftermath of a battlefield  also good to see fido is back  the scene where they should him was pretty emotional too with that piano version of avid playing in the background  really liking this show so far"
2980,The moment they get a speed limit is the moment Germans will start driving like other nations. Not leaving the left lane because they are already doing the speed limit. I applaud any nation without a speed limit. It makes for better drivers because people will actually have to look in their rear view mirror or risk becoming one with someone doing 200+ kph
2981,The more things change  the more they stay the same. Shinei resumes his role in the battlefield  liberating his fellow fallen comrades. His entire squad is all but wiped out  it just goes to show how high the mortality rate is in the war against the legion. I feel like the Giad machinery are less mobile efficient than the juggernauts  but that's just my guess.   Glad we did get some heartfelt moments  such as finally erecting a memorial for our long time 86 squad members as well as reuniting with Fido. But 86 goes all the way with a 180 degree turn and hurts us again with another death. The music in this show is phenomenal and I loved every second of this episode.
2982,The most important thing when reading / watching someone's opinion on the right way to do game design is just that you consider their position. GTMK's word isn't absolute fact but he does obviously put some thought / research into his opinions. So it is possible to gain a lot of knowledge in an area very quickly by watching his videos.   I will admit I do think a bit less of gamedev youtubers  as in ones who do coding tutorials on the best architectural way to solve a problem  who haven't released a game.
2983,The Norwegian government is possibly short sighted  because the long term issues with Li-Ion battery recycling and related mining are not well understood.  Perhaps it would take governments across the world decades to fully understand the implications  just like it took European governments decades to stop promoting diesel engines.
2984,"The obvious win-win situation would be to play those systems with different groups. Online is great for that. And make them shorter campaigns so that you don't get bored with them.  To keep your game fresh  you can ""steal"" the cool stuff from the other rpgs and make it into homebrew for the current game. This is my favorite way to play now. I use a base system that is easy to mod  and just retro-fit settings  mass combat systems  monsters  items  etc from other games. This is especially effective when the other games have specific mechanics for stuff that doesn't exist in the base game."
2985,The only cars that can reasonably be expected to beat the market over the coming decades are already outrageously expensive  so I personally think it's dumb to not drive a car because of its investment potential.  If you don't love the car enough to drive it  sell it and buy index funds. You'll make more money. If you do love the car enough to keep it  drive it! That's the joy of them.   And for the guys out there who don't care about the investment per se  but just like the idea of having a rare  expensive low mileage car that other people can't have merely for the prestige of it  I'd consider that a personality flaw. That's just ego.
2986,"The only games that do the whole ""job"" thing are Final Fantasy or at the very least games developed by Square enix.  I'm pretty sure off titles like Bravely Default and Octopath Traveler use ""jobs"" but still... Square Enix all the same.  It's just a word they use for classes.  It started with Final Fantasy Tactics or perhaps FF2 or 3?  One of those"
2987,The only one that springs to mind immediately is BRP.  Whenever you use a skill you put a check mark next to it  then at the end of the session you make an advancement roll to see if the skill gets improved.    You might also consider playing GURPS.  Players gain character points which they can use to improve their abilities.  Normally players can spend their cp on any available ability  but you could implement a house rule that cp must be spend on an ability that was used or practiced during the session.    On the minimalist side  I've been playing a lot of [Roll for Shoes](https://rollforshoes.com/) lately.  It sound like you are looking for something with a little more crunch  but I thought I would mention it anyway.  When you use a skill and roll all 6s you get a new skill one rank higher with a more narrow focus.
2988,The only possible reason for this that I can think of is that someone could steal your phone and part it out similar to a car and this way it is impossible. However  this is a pretty weak argument because people break their phone screens all the time.
2989,The only real way to combat poaching is to reduce the demand for the products made from the poached animals  for example Ivory. Ivory was used in pianos for a long time  so making a virtual piano could be one way to combat it. I dont really know what they use ivory and the other rare animal products for anymore though  so you would have to research that.
2990,The only series that really refers to classes as a job is Final Fantasy. Basically everything else refers to specific designated roles as classes. If you're struggling between the two for some reason  just call it a class. The small handful of people in the world who *only* play Final Fantasy games and would correct you would know what you mean anyway.
2991,The only source I've found is a 5900X with 192MB of L3 cache tacked on via 3D V-Cache. Yet many people seem to think the Zen 3 refresh has V Cache and V Cache = ~15%  so Zen 3 refresh == ~15%   Are people actually expecting the entire Zen 3 line to come out with 192MB of L3 just because die stacking is a thing? Or have people just confused a specific configuration in an engineering demo with a broad picture of what V-Cache will add to Zen 3?  To me  in a silicon shortage  192MB of L3 even for a 5900X seems pie in the sky  let alone for the entire range... so is there another source people are getting this idea from?
2992,The only thing I worry about with halo having BR is the stretching of resources and splintering of player base. I heavily prefer objective modes over slayer  so I just really want to make sure the game launches with objectives and forge  and that they are complete. I dont want to see 20 different playlists to the point where they have to either loosen matchmaking rules so the games are lopsided or it makes you wait 15 minutes to find a game. Aside from those concerns  Halo seems pretty well suited for BR  so as long as it makes sense and plays well  why the hell not?
2993,The only thing super Mario rpg could use is varying difficulty settings  it's too easy but other than that I agree it's perfect as is. Any attempt to modernize the graphics or anything would definitely just make the game way worse.
2994,The only time I have seen anything like this is in my buddys drift mustang. When he has racing tires on with his welded diff the back end will hoop around under city driving  but what you are describing is BS your friend needs an alignment or a second opinion from not the original mechanic
2995,The OP   [](#awe)  I should probably watch the episode  but wow I love it.  Edgy MC who always wins  knowledgeable friend who explains stuff  and the gifted new player still learning the ropes. I'm honestly lost as heck when they start playing and can only follow half of what's going on  but regardless loving this show more than I should be. I just need a double battle at some point and all will be good. Also the music change for the MCs last turn.  [](#hnng)
2996,The opposite here. As I get older  I have less and less free time. I used to love getting lost in games  exploring  taking my time. Now it's like I have to maximize what little free time I have and run through the game as quickly as possible. But in bite-sized moments  since I'm not usually playing everyday. When you stretch out these 40+ hour games  it can be easy to lose interest. So lots of times I'll get like 20-some hours into the game  lose interest and stop for a few weeks or months  and then return to the game to find myself completely lost. I'll either restart the game or (and this is more common) give it up and play something else.
2997,The outer diameter of the rubber has be consistent between rim / tire selections.  Larger rim = less rubber tire height.   Smaller rims will probably rub against you brake caliper.  One size down may work.  Larger rims - one size up will probably work  but the tire will have less height = a harsher ride.
2998,The overwhelming consensus is to NOT waste your time/money on degree programmes if you want to be a concept artist  reason being that only your portfolio matters  followed by the people you know (but only if you have a decent portfolio). No one cares about your degree unless you want to teach  and getting a degree doesn't mean you gain a high enough skill in the core fundamentals of design  drawing  rendering etc that every working concept artist will need. This applies even if you are planning to work on top Maya/Blender block outs or renders - you are still going to need to know how lighting forms work if you are going to paint over or photobash.  If you are just starting out  you probably could get by with practicing and studying on your own  though if you are particularly lost you could always get an online mentorship for a few months to help chart out what you need to tackle. If you have decent fundamentals under your belt you could look at online courses at Gnomon  Syn Studio  Schoolism etc so you can learn specific workflows for environment concept art  and to get feedback from people already in the industry.  Check out people like Karla Ortiz  Adam Duff  Tyler Edlinz or your favourite concept artists for their views on going to art school before committing to the decision! Twitter  YouTube & Artstation contain piles and piles of advice for baby concept artists. The Rookies' Rookie of the Year competition might also give you a rough idea of where you should be headed.  Edit: I went to check out your post in r/advice  and I just wanted to say that I hope you don't feel too bad about the crit you got! It takes time to build up the skills you need  and with enough focused practice on your weaknesses you'd be surprised at your improvement. Also  using 3d for environmental art is almost a given in the industry  simply because it streamlines the workflow by a great deal.
2999,The padding only gets worse. Towards the end of Varnhold Vanishing you have to fight through so many filler mobs that will be a make or break moment for finishing the game (even then youve still got plenty to do before the end)
3000,The pathfinder games are like lotr extended editions  you get them and you sit down and enjoy a long ride. 120-130 hours easily.  Wrath has a lot going for it  including a lot of replay ability due to mythic path routes.    That said  owlcat arent very good at balancing things. There is stat bloat and difficulty spikes in both pathfinder games  so you need to be prepared for some frustration at times. Still  there are few 100+ hour experiences with a superb story out there; kingmaker is a fantastic tale of curses  whereas wrath is a superb story of demon invasions and has probably one of the most well written villains out there.
3001,"The plug might be only ""twisted"" so basically with the usage you twisted it inside. Might be possible to fix without soldering a new plug  however you need to open the chassis to assert the damage.  Once you have done that  you might be able to fix it - or absolutely ruin it - yourself.Proceed with care. Better to seek a professional.  On a ""family"" shop it is **not** an expensive fix  but still some bucks  depending on the shop ofc.It is 100% not solvable with a new power cord.  Edit: Opening the chassis will definitely void the warranty - or insurance - if any."
3002,The Price of Freedom  is an underappreciated gem  from probably the most avant-garde RPG and RP author alive  possibly in history. Any game that is Red Dawn mixed with Outsiders has Patrick Swayze's endorsement  maybe even Matt Dillon's.. Idk I would think they would have liked The Price of Freedom  a lot.  If your game can be even half as good as The Price of Freedom  it would be Okay-ish. Just saying. I mean its hard to comment on a game from reviews  but  yes 1980s is a legitimate milieu for something like The Watchmen too.  1980s was good. It's great now though in retrospect.  Ymmv
3003,The problem is  other than automatic  there are more power options with the Si and Type R.  Maybe someday they will put an auto in one of them but I don't see them putting one of those engines in a standard civic.
3004,The problem with the GT-8 was it had a completely unique CVT which was unlike anything Nissan has done before or since. Not particularly unreliable to start with but as the cars aged they became an issue (even changing the fluid was an expensive exercise).   The lower trims used either a 2.5 or 3l version of the VQ with an early attempt at direct injection. I had a 3l with a normal 5 speed auto (best combo aside from the 3.5 manual) for quite a few years and it was extremely sensitive to fuel quality - would run like absolute arse if the fuel was even slightly off.
3005,The problem you describe is exactly why people use non-random character creation or only do group character creation. In my opinion  if you do random characters  you *always* get this kind of problem if someone rolls especially high when nobody else is watching. It's really inevitable and  honestly  you should expect it to happen at some point.  Random character creation allows people to get lucky with their stats. Getting lucky means that their stats are improbably good. If you are going to get suspicious if someone shows up with improbably good stats  why do you even allow rolling?
3006,The program will likely not *run* slower  since the program is loaded into memory when starting it. however it almost always will load slower so it will take more time to start. If you have very large programs like games  which cant be fully loaded into memory  loading screens and similar might take longer than if theyre just on the ssd.  Hope this answers everything  if not feel free to just ask me again.
3007,The reason EVs sell like crazy in Norway is down to taxes.  Norway has enormous taxes on new cars and EVs are exempt.   This is a country where a new 3 series approaches $100 000 and the fuel to run it costs over $8US per US gallon.   At those numbers a $55 000 Tesla makes a TON of sense.
3008,The reason you are developing a game is to me everything. Why are you doing it?(or you should ask this to your self) The answers can be very broad. Why would you go through hell (in some case)... you better have a good (personal) reason to do it. Solo game dev is also entrepreneurship  and starting from nothing (lacking skills and or capital ) is a very uncomfortable place to be.
3009,The relevant question would just be why do people want a coupe. There are many reasons which include liking how they look  not needing any more space  etc.  The FWD part is utterly irrelevant to the vast majority of buyers. They don't know or care about the difference and certainly won't ever notice it in their daily driving. Otherwise the point of FWD is it's a bit more efficient  it's a bit simpler to assemble at the factory  and in this particular case the most important part would be they can use existing architecture instead of developing a totally new RWD chassis.
3010,The reminds me of the time the NAACP went after a greeting card company because they were convinced they were saying *black whores* instead of *black holes*. Listen  human perceive words in strange ways. The brain actively manipulates how we hear sounds to make them sound like words we know. Its not that implausible that this is a complete coincidence and not at all intentional.
3011,The reviews seem to suggest theyre not  or at least not yet.  Tritons are solid  reliable  well priced  and Mitsubishi has been making utes for decades. If I was on a tight budget that would be my first choice.
3012,The right tool for the right situation  I say.  Generally speaking  I prefer running games in my own settings for two reasons. Firstly  if a player knows a lot more about a setting than the GM it can cause serious problems as a player acts on information the GM doesn't have. I remember trying to run a game of Exalted for a group of 2e vets when I had only read 3e core; one player got annoyed because I didn't allow him to play a specific people (The Djala) unmentioned in core and another stated flat out how he could summon high power demons. The second reason is that I'm a maladaptive daydreamer with a sucker for worldbuilding; I was once so obsessed with a setting I made for Pathfinder 2e that I wrote a 20k word long world guide (there were only two other people in the group at the time).   That second fact does play a little into why I'm interested in some IP-based games. If players have similar experiences with a setting  it can be fun to explore together  and some settings have enough worldbuilding to make me obsessed with them  too. That's why I'm patiently waiting for Obsidian to finally release that Pillars Of Eternity RPG they've been working on.
3013,"The rules of D&D encourage a playstyle that I don't like.    ...and every time I say that  people complain ""But you \*can\* do that in D&D!""  And yeah  you can swim against the tide to make a politics-heavy  negotiation-intense D&D campaign.  But those all suppose having a group of players who want a very specific type of game - and if you have a group of players all so mightily focused on a given playstyle  \*you don't need rules\*.    An RPG's rules are there to encourage players into a certain play experience.  And D&D so heavily presses people down those paths that at this point I feel like I've played every D&D campaign - unless we have a group of very dedicated players  I'm all but guaranteed at least one grumpy bearded dwarf or one whacky kender or one steals-everything pixie rogue.  I'm all but guaranteed that D&D combat has little to do with your personality  but is mostly driven by min-maxing stats.      And there's nothing wrong with wanting that!  If you wanna play a Legolas or Drizzt Do'Urden clone  you do you  boo.  But I crave novelty  and usually D&D's rules ultimately winds up shepherding everyone back down the same comfort-food paths.    Nothing wrong with people who want comfort food.  But ain't the restaurant I choose to dine at.  (I wrote about this in slightly more depth [in this blog entry](https://www.theferrett.com/2021/02/24/why-i-dont-like-playing-dungeons-and-dragons-any-more-but-love-other-rpgs/).)"
3014,The serpentine belt tensioner. I have the 2zz in my matrix and there's a small difference between the tensioner for the 2zz and the one for the 1zz. Add in they made the damn thing out of aluminum for something you're going to put steel tools on and the space infront of the tensioner you cannot fit a ratchet so you either need a tensioner tool or a wrench  and with the wrench you're probably going to slip off. And if your steel wrench slips off the aluminum tensioner you're going to have a bad day.
3015,The service manual and parts catalogue for the 2015+ Chevy SS does not show mag ride suspension components. The damper diagrams are all from a 2014 model that had regular non-mag ride macpherson struts.   I found this out the hard way when installing new springs and all diagrams showed strut mounted bump stops. Mag ride shocks have internal bump stops and the ones from the parts catalogue physically do not fit on a mag ride shock.
3016,The simple answer is you should not run the actual simulation and should probably instead move things around according to some rules in a way that makes things change in an interesting way depending on how much time is supposed to have passed.  For proper accelerated simulation at 40x  as far as I know you can't really do that if you work in Unity the way it's intended to work  because you have to advance your simulation repeatedly but skip rendering. Unity does not support that easily  so you would have to ensure all your objects' simulation and physics are implemented outside the core engine functions (Update  FixedUpdate  PhysX etc) and can be advanced repeatedly outside the rendering loop. This may mean writing your own physics engine. Even then  you could use an adjusted longer delta time for some parts of the simulation  but physics simulation does not respond well to long timesteps and will require subdividing the timestep or suffer catastrophic instability. So in the end it would still likely take a good fraction of the time it would take to wait for the simulation to pass in realtime if you want the results to be the same.  In the end  it's not that it's impossible to do  but it requires a lot of effort in architecting the game according to a feature that will deliver little value to the player compared to faking some random changes  since they're not seeing it happen. A version where you fake changes will likely be both easier to do and give more interesting results for the player (still not easy though).
3017,The Skinner box is enabled due to the fact that an animal will get a biologically salient reward for engaging in it (food or drugs even) but for video games the mechanics wont be equally appealing to everyone
3018,"The Sprawl - it is PbtA game about runners. Like other PbtA games it is rules-light and theme-focused.  Shadow of the Beanstalk - setting for Genesys system. Genesys is a generic system with a special dice. First  with that dice you can easily customize rolls (modifiers  difficulty  special coniditions and etc). Second  with one roll you can get plenty of different results (success with advantage  fail with disadvantage and etc). As for setting - it is hard sci-fi with: social inequality (high tech-low life of cyberpunk)  dominance of corporations (also attribute of cyberpunks)  cyberweb  androids (clones and ""robots"")  colonization of solar system (Moon and Mars). Also it features space elevator (Beanstalk)!"
3019,"The title is confusing and technically incorrect.  They are obviously not removing ""TCP/IP multiplayer""  as the multiplayer must almost _necessarily_ be built on top of TCP/IP. I believe what they're removing is the ability to locally host the server  instead requiring players to connect to the official servers.  The ""security risk"" they're talking about then is that it's very easy to cheat when you host your own server."
3020,"The triple threat in game design: Genre  Scope  and High Concept.   High Concept is your single sentence that drives the direction. Genre establishes several design elements. Scope controls total content.  I myself have a couple High Concepts  have only matched one with a genre  but have been struggling to establish scope.  So  nothing is actually happening with either game due to uncertainty of scope. Lacking Scope means being at risk of the dreaded ""Feature Creep"" which can have me spending time on adding useless or redundant content."
3021,The truth  unaltered and unforgiving  is this: video games are a waste of time. RPGs take a long time to finish  and so they are even more of a waste of time. Theres life to live away from my console or PC  people to spend time with  things to achieve. And video games take hours  days  weeks of my life away from all of that in order to merely entertain.   And yet  I enjoy them. I think about them when not playing them  am curious about the story that is so slowly unfolding  think about the stats and gear and mobs and lore. So I boot whatever my game of the moment is every day and choose to waste that time. And am mostly happy to do so.   But at times  often when Im about 2/3 of the way through a game  when Ive figured it all out and its no longer much of a challengebut there are still endless crates to open and NPCs to talk to and gear slots to optimize and faceless mindless mobs to murderat times I feel the truth of all that wasted time  and I sit back and ask myself what the hell Im doing.
3022,The used car market is crazy right now. This is the best time for you to sell it. Sell it make the extra money  wait until everything comes down which might be a couple years and then when things are better for you buy one that you like. Honestly this is the best time for this to happen. Use the money towards something good now and in the future you can have something nicer and get it at a good price because the market won't be insane hopefully.
3023,"The video is about 15 years too late  at least for me!  When I was a kid  I always assumed that higher clockspeed = better performance. That's why I made the jump from a perfectly adequate Pentium 3 733 with 256MB of RAM to a Pentium 4 1.5 with 384MB of RAM but was quite underwhelmed by the performance. Upgrading the RAM to 512MB didn't help either.  Years later I upgraded to a Pentium 4 HT 3.06 and the video card to a 6600GT (AGP). Luckily that was enough to push Doom 3  GTA-SA  Hitman 4 and Half Life 2 at around 60FPS 1024p. I was pretty happy  actually.  But then came Fallout 3 and Far Cry 2...  6600GT was ""only"" 4 years old when these games were launched but despite that they ran at like 15-20FPS at 480p.  Nowadays  even the 6 years old GTX1060 3GB is pretty darn capable  at least at 1080p. And then there's the legendary i7-2600  a decade old CPU that's still surprisingly relevant!"
3024,The wagon thing is kind of interesting. Nice to see car manufacturers recently tricking people into buying wagons/minivans by lifting them slightly and putting black plastic around the wheel arches and then selling them as crossovers.
3025,the way eugene was talking the whole episode  i knew it couldnt end well for him. seeing his arm detached from his body and then his brains blown out was disturbing.  onlookers are falling back into a cycle of hatred towards the 86 (even though theyre not even different anymore racially!)  and shin is falling back into a cycle of war and death even though he has every opportunity to leave. now eugenes another comrade to carry on his shoulders to the promised land
3026,The way Steve lets customer service choose the build and being on a short deadline really screws up price to performance.  Looking at HP's site right now for the same TG01-1160XT $750 base price for a 10400  8GB  256GB and 1650  If you upgrade to the i7-10700 it bumps you up to 16GB of RAM and its faster 2933mhz (10400 gets 2666mhz). Total becomes $1060  Throw in the 3060  and like Steve said its $70 less than a 2060 Super. Total becomes $1420.   So yeah  10700+16GB faster RAM+3060 for the same price as what Steve paid for a shit box because of customer support and his deadline.
3027,The way to have predetermined random generation is with seeds. When you create your algorithm for procedurally generating the level  simply pass a seed into the random number generator. This will make it so that it will generate the same level every time you give it the same seed. An easy way to make every level different would be to just pass the level number in as the seed.
3028,The website reviews make it seem sort of sketch  but that price has me wanting to risk it since I've been having a horrible time finding a good deal for just a ryzen 5800h and rtx 3060 combo in a laptop
3029,the whole video game sphere is just the greediest shit known to fucking man i mean i just want to play a few games after a long day but not spend 800-2k on them especially when we are in a recession/depression money is already tight.
3030,"The YouTube channel [Esoterica](https://youtube.com/c/ESOTERICAchannel) (I know  I know  ""esoteric"") has a lot of videos on ancient (and more recent) Jewish mysticism which I can't check right now to link you to anything specific. They seem fairly well-researched  given the subject matter.   What do you want to use the angel for? The way you want it to fit into your game might help you get better suggestions."
3031,Therapy is obviously a good idea if you're finding that it ruins things for you.  In the meantime  maybe try not letting yourself pause/write notes until the end of the movie? You can still think about it  but maybe you'll at least manage to get a bit lost in the actual movie or show you're watching.
3032,There a lot of phone reviewed by NoteBookCheck which have 0 PWM at all brightness levels so they must be using DCD.  So it's being used by some companies  although they don't bother to advertise it.  As far as I can tell  at least.
3033,There also shouldn't be a speed limit to begin with. Germany profits from very good lane discipline. Nobody overtakes on the right  everybody follows the speed limit and the fast lane is generally only used for.. well.. going fast. The Autobahn is also surprisingly safe  look up the statistics. It also wouldn't make much of a difference from an environmental standpoint  as Germany only emits very few Co2 emissions  I believe it's only 2% of the worldwide emitted Co2  and only about I think 0.00x% of that is emitted by traffic. There's simply no reason for a speed limit to be introduced. I'm happy about these news
3034,There are a couple of threads on this topic with lots of suggestions and links. You might want to search previous posts.  Rory's Story Cubes and the card game Once Upon a Time are both great entry level games that will teach storytelling skills to kids. Rules are easy and you can ease kids into RPGs from there.  Fate Accelerated Edition or Secrets of Cats might be good in a year or two  after No Thank You  Evil.
3035,"There are a few reasons I am skeptical about the picture the leaks seem to be painting.   1. For the past few Intel Desktop series  there have been leaks that generate massive hype only to lead to a crash of sorts when launch reviews come out.  2. Intel has a pattern of only showing the rosiest of pictures and usually the truth lies in what they omit. 3. These leaks seem to all be better then what Intel has claimed with higher ST and MT performance than one would expect for ""up to 19% IPC"" uplift.  4. This is a new arch and when there is a brand new arch  there are teething problems and programs/games need time to be optimized. Contrary to what many people assume  Intel is not an exception to the rule. Its just been so long  people forgot.  I was skeptical at first when all the rumors about Zen 1 came out and I am skeptical now. That doesnt mean the hype wont be realized and so I am exited to see what happens with Alderlake and Zen3d. I jumped on Ryzen 1000 series a couple months after release and I think I will for both Alderlake and Zen3d because its really exciting tech all round."
3036,There are companies like Battle Foam that make dedicated bags to store and carry miniatures  but they are very expensive. I own a few bought on very deep discounted clearance sales. However  you can find cases by Feldherr Amazon that offer much cheaper alternatives. For a while  I was able to find pick foam trays that fit into comic storage boxes  and that served me well for years.
3037,There are definitely drawbacks to being good'. It means not taking the easiest path. If you want something that belongs to someone else you cant just kill them and take it  you have give them something in return if they're even willing to part with it in the first place and if theyre not youre out of luck. It almost always means doing the more difficult thing  the benefits are more long term.
3038,There are plenty of historical examples of people siding with the other side to avoid something worse.    It depends on the character's justification and if they can live with the decision. Many people can justify bad actions by telling themselves it is for the greater good.
3039,There are plenty of mechanics in D&D that I don't like  but I can get over that...  It's the fact that the implied setting is *very* specific  and it's really  *really* baked into the game.  Creating a game that I really wanted just became too damn hard.
3040,There are plenty of players like this  but realize that actual plays aren't as spontaneous as you think. They are becoming more like scripted shows and often good bits have to be edited out.  I don't really follow actual plays - not my thing. Sorry I can't help.
3041,There are plenty of systems that dont have lots of maths and still have dice  or some way of resolving uncertainty.   Sounds like you tried an older design that centered accounting for numerous detailed factors.  GUMSHOE games focus on investigative play and use just 1 regular six-sided die.  PbtA games use 2 dice +/- a number from 1-3.   FitD games use a handful of dice (5 or less usually) and read the highest as the result.  Year Zero games use a similarly-sized pool and count 6s as good and 1s as bad.  There are lots of options before you go diceless.   If you want to go diceless after all  I love Dialect. I love Icarus and Fall of Magic too  but theyre not *totally* diceless.  Oh  Alice is Missing is diceless  silent  and amazing!  DramaSystem is diceless but uses cards if you have procedural questions to resolve.
3042,There are some decent tutorial videos on speaking better on YouTube. I found I could have a much richer and clearer voice with less nasal drone by intentionally opening my throat wider. Kind of hard to describe it any better than that  and the specific thing you need might be a little different.  Find someone who is willing to go along with it and then try some of the many available vocal exercises in their presence  since you cant really tell what your own voice sounds like  until you find something that works for you.
3043,"There are two games that immediately come to mind when I think ""modern  urban world"":  Mother 2 (commonly known as EarthBound) is set in a version of contemporary America  complete with hamburgers as healing items  hospitals to recover from injuries  and resting in hotels.  Yakuza: Like a Dragon is set in modern-day Japan  the ""classes"" are literally jobs that you get from an employment agency  you'll have to dodge cars while crossing the street  and you can also take classes at a vocational school to round out your personality."
3044,There are very few anime quite like Cowboy Bebop which has both positive and negative aspects.   The positive being its storytelling style is very accessible to Western fans  hence its status as an enduring gateway drug from the early 00s anime explosion. On the negative being more Western styled it can give you a certain skewed view of what anime is really all about.   On balance I would say it is still totally worth your time though. And if you like it or not here are some other items to try right now on (American) Netflix:  * Lupin the III: The Castle of Cagliostro :: The first movie by the legendary Hayao Miyazaki  old as hell but beautifully animated so it ages like fine wine. A light hearted  almost fairly tale  adventure caper centered around a gentleman thief.  * Fullmetal Alchemist: **Brotherhood** :: FMA is another legend and rightly so because it quite simply one of the best manga and then anime ever made. And it will fuck you up the first time. Be aware the Brotherhood subtitle is important the series was actually made twice  this version being made after the manga is complete and thus the canonical story  though the other FMA is still entirely excellent in the first half... maybe even slightly better in the way it sets up FMA first gut punch. Speaking of which fair warning this show can fuck you up if you've never encountered the spoilers.  * DuRaRaRa :: A show more in tune with how batshit anime can get but still sort of accessible to outsiders. Centers around a series of not-all-that-related events and people in a certain district of Tokyo. Extremely modern in style. Possibly the closest match to Cowboy Bebop on this list being an anthology style tale.  * Kill la Kill :: When you *know* you're a degenerate like us and ready to jump in the deep end... watch this. Do NOT watch it in public or anywhere where the uninitiated can walk up to you without your back to the wall. * Gurren Lagann :: If you liked the above this is what a bunch of the guys who made Kill la Kill did first. Balls to the wall crazy mecha show that ups the power level to the max (eventually) and another legend. Warning  for whatever reason Netflix has the censored clip-show version of Episode 6  you'll have to sail the high seas for the real episode. * Dragon Pilot :: Just one here because its a personal favorite of mine and a bit of an unknown you won't hear people talk about. Its an extremely wholesome and cute show about a girl selected to well pilot a dragon after... welll you'll see.   Other stuff worth a look includes BNA  Code Geass  Little Witch Academia  Magi  and Neon Genesis Evangelion.  And the final one  I promise  is if you want to laugh your fucking ass off watch Way of the Househusband. Be aware it is (deliberately) done with extremely limited animation like watching a comic or adult swim stuff. Also its extremely fucking short bits.
3045,There is a difference with the Pre Order bonuses for both games  with Wonderlands  you get a golden armor set  while with Stranger Of Paradise  you get three weapons and 1 to 3 day early access based on your platform. It is also worth mentioning that these two games release a week apart from each other  but are very different types of RPGs  [View Poll](https://www.reddit.com/poll/q28m4v)
3046,"There is a FB group called ""tabletop rpg one shot group"" for talking about and getting players for one shots.  I don't know how much time you have but maybe you could do one shots on the side to scratch the itch.  An idea I just had is maybe have the group be interdimensional travellers.  As they travel each dimension changes everything including the travellers.  This would mean translating the PCs to different systems  but would allow them to keep backgrounds and personalities.  Maybe it is a multiverse idea so each PC already exists at the destination and arrives with place  position and a few friends/contacts  who might be eerily similar to ones they made in other dimensions."
3047,"There is a Swedish horror-game based on the writings of author Anders Fager  called ""Svenska Kulter rollspelet"". At least one of the more central novellas he wrote is based in/near my hometown.  &#x200B;  Then we have the game ""Skjut dem i huvudet"" (a Swedish Zombie-game that takes place in a post-apocalyptic Gothenburg (where I work).."
3048,there is no real reason to go that fast. Even the times i've been on the Autobahn   the majority of people stay at around 130km/h since that's where cars are more fuel efficient  very rarely to you see someone go over 200km/h
3049,"there is no sense in which this isn't just tsmc poking fun at competitors' virtue signalling  everyone in the market knows it's driven by mindless consumerism and if you really cared about the environment then you would be doing something else entirely  not prodding a pin at a date when you reckon renewable energy will be cheap and accessible enough that you can creatively account yourself into the ""carbon neutral"" brand  i for one will become carbon neutral at some point after death  like all animals  maybe. you are welcome  planet"
3050,There really haven't been any based on my hometown.  However the ffg end of the world rpgs were designed to play yourself  so running them in your hometown would be optimal.  But  Savage Worlds just released a kickstarter today for Holler which is about the Appalachian mountain region  which is where my hometown is.  I must say that it is extremely tempting even though I don't play savage worlds currently.
3051,There should be instructions for break-in in the manual. Mine said dont go over 4K rpms for the first 1k miles and dont use cruise control for a long time. Its not the end of the world if you accidentally hit 4500 a few times though  modern engines are pretty resilient
3052,There was a collection of two dungeon crawlers released for Steam & Switch called Saviors of Sapphire Wings & Stranger of Sword City Revisited. Two very fun DRPGs with great content  fun visuals  and a decent story. Received an average score of about 80/100 on metacritic with positive critic reviews.
3053,"There was a great post in the past about the ""Dora"" system.   I can't give it the proper elegance  but the author described always having three named places on the way between two end points  each of which had some strong visual and some problem to solve  not always combat    The Hungry River  where river rapids churn below a rotted rope bridge over the chasm....  The Bog of Stench  where the air shimmers from the noxious vapors  how will you cross it....  The Green Desert  a set of rolling grasslands  where nomadic traders dwell  their garishly colored tents inviting traders and merchants....  The article had a lot more to suggest  but I didn't find in in a 15second search  so all you get is this much ;/"
3054,There was just [this thread](https://old.reddit.com/r/rpg_gamers/comments/q8kcaa/any_pathfinder_fans_here_ive_been_playing/) by a PS4 player who said they loved it and had no major issues. No idea how that transfers to other consoles.
3055,"There's a few answers to this.    For the rolling characters part  I generally have players use point-buy instead of rolling. It lets them feel more in control of their build and everyone has a fair shot this way.    For HP I use the average +1 (so a d10 is always 6  d8 is always 5).    I also always have everyone roll attacks and other checks publicly. The die has to land flat on the table or it doesn't count!   As an added bonus I do this myself as well whenever possible(to add some tension and perceived risk; they know I'm not fudging on their behalf!)    If I suspect someone of cheating in some other way  I start paying closer attention to them. I've had a player ""conveniently"" misunderstand how a spell works  for instance  so I started keeping D&D Beyond open on my laptop so I could review what he was trying to do from then on."
3056,There's a few possibilities. If having a targeting bool is enough for your purpose  go ahead and keep it. It only really becomes an issue if you start having more functionality that interacts with this one  for instance a reloading state that prevents targeting  transition animations  etc.  Another possibility is to have two state machines: an upper-body state machine and a lower-body state machine. They may need synchronizing from time to time if you need to play full body animations  and that can be annoying.  Finally you can make a more complete Hierarchical (or Nested) State Machine  which allows you to have states within states. This is what we've done in several games I've worked on. This can allow reusing states in multiple contexts  such as being in an Idle state that pushes a Targeting state  or in a Running state that also pushes the Targeting state. You are then considered in all of the states on your state stack. This is tricky to implement right though and needs careful design  but used correctly can be extremely powerful. I'm aware of a C++ HSM library that I can recommend ( https://github.com/amaiorano/hsm )  but there's probably other good ones out there.
3057,There's a lot more info needed to really say what it's like.  -Are you using an existing system or making one from scratch?  -Is this game intended for quick one-shots or long epic campaigns?  -Are you intending for the rulebook to be a fully illustrated  professional looking book  or is this basically just a Word document?  BTW  just based off your description  Starfinder might actually work pretty well for what you're looking for  since it combines sci-fi and magical elements.  You can just have the sci-fi fleet have access to tech but not magic  and the industrial fantasy have access to magic but very cut-down tech.
3058,There's a reason the web exploded  and it's not just because people liked it.  The key was that it's pretty easy to actually develop a website and certainly in the early days  there was an explosion of people who considered themselves web developers who barely knew one end of a PC from another beforehand.  It's certainly a more complex beast these days with SPAs  frameworks  typescript  more complex backends etc. but fundamentally the browser does a huge amount of heavy lifting for you.
3059,There's a section in my game where you can access an arcade machine  and on it is a game of Tetris you can play. The stuff is retextured and named something different but I was just wondering if this would breach any copyright  cause I see people do this all the time. There's another section with Space Invaders  btw.
3060,There's a whole pile of cities and places in Washington named after directional landmarks. I always thought they'd be good for border crossings or other rest stops in an RPG.  Two sections of Bellevue are called Eastgate (the east edge of Bellevue) and Crossroads (which is right beside the border of Bellevue and Redmond  with Kirkland just past it as well). There's a city called North Bend  because the Snoqualmie River literally bends to the north in it. Seattle has a mall called Westlake (not particularly near a lake either). The north end of Seattle is called Northgate. South of Seattle in Tukwilla is Southcenter.
3061,There's dozens of us I tell you! Dozens!  Seriously though  speaking from personal experience I wanted a FWD coupe because 1) they're cheap 2) they're lighter than an equivalent RWD and 3) I like the style.   I can understand why it's a dead segment these days though. The cost of new cars has risen enough that people don't want to invest in a car that may not meet they're needs 5 years down the line. Stricter safety standards have increased weight to the point there's not much difference between FWD and RWD. The coupe body style in general has fallen out of general favor as more and more of the market shifts toward SUVs. Even RWD coupes are starting to dwindle.
3062,"There's just something wholesome about the characters and their chemistries in this anime. Takeda is such an awesome senpai (but dense) and Igarashi's attempt to make her senpai notice her (haha  get it?) was entertaining.  But I guess the highlight for me here is Kazama and Sakurai's relationship. I'm already loving the chemistry of these two. Just two episodes and we're already treated with such great ship. That subtle ""suki"" even though they're talking about ramen  ugh  love it. I think I like their chemistry more (Takeda and Igarashi together is still entertaining tho). The fact that we're getting developments for supporting characters is just wholesome on its own.  Overall another great episode and I'm really looking forward to more great moments with the whole cast."
3063,there's literally nothing I can do Incorrect. Block and ignore people who are only engaging with you in bad faith or to be hurtful. They are time vampires. The only thing you owe to anyone that bought your game is a working product. Do not permit them to rule your life.
3064,There's no such thing as a game that is easy to learn for everyone. We all have our own individual perceptions and experiences and hangups  so don't get stuck thinking you need to find an *easy* game. No such thing exists. Sure  some have lesser or more learning curves  but again - those come easy to some  difficult to others. Instead  you should all agree on a few games to try and just try them. If they click  great! If not  move on. Regardless of the game you choose you'll be making an effort  so  you may as well make that effort with a game you're excited to play.
3065,There's really a way more things you need to learn when it comes to game dev. Even if you're quite good at your current language of expertise  there are other disciplines you need to learn that you need to make a decent game. Sound  graphic design  level design  physics  mechanica are some of the I guess are the basic ones. Then when you go 3d you'll need 3d models then different physics workflow. It's really quite daunting and will surely take time before you get to somewhere you can say that you understand something and able to make a game. There's a reason why game dev companies takes years to release something
3066,There's some nostalgic podcasts based here in the UK that have international audiences and run both online and in person cons  The Grognard Files is a particularly good one and the community around that is mostly older gentlemen  say
3067,There's something very precious and wholesome about [a girl who just wants to have friends](https://i.imgur.com/sMgowmx.png) playing [a deck whose ace card gains power from having more allies on the field](https://i.imgur.com/UNG2rBg.png). Hiyori is precious and [her smile must be protected at all costs](https://i.imgur.com/5ZH8Jq9.png).  We got some more lore on the city and the King  Hiyori's flashback to her childhood (side note: showing flashbacks in 4:3 ratio is a weird stylistic choice) was sad but interesting  the battle itself was fun (Hiyori actually playing sub-optimally because she's inexperienced was a nice touch) and Teruto being comically edgy the whole time was hilarious  the card game aspect seems well-explained and easy to follow without being too complicated  and the show's OP is an *absolute banger*. I think this show is off to a great start so far.
3068,Theres the 86 I know! Giving us 2 and a half episodes of happy things and then punting us in the feels balls as hard as it can. Beautiful.   At least it was fun for a minute. Shin having his Top Gun moment in the beginning by managing to flip his big ass tank. Shin just manages to be effortlessly cool and even has an Iceman in the redhead guy. The scene after though was the happy tears segment of the episode. The monument to the fallen 86 they made for them was a touching moment  but I actually lost it at Fido being alive. Shin looked legitimately happy for once and I fucking love Fido. I was also joking last week  but now she actually is their mascot in an official role. How adorable and also appropriate for their unit to have her. A cast-off an old regime and a lost soul looking for meaning. Plus gives us more brother-sister time with her and Shin.   Then the punting happens. I do appreciate that they wasted zero time making us think Eugene was going to survive after all those death flags. The suddenness and brutality with how they off him in the next scene ripped my heart out in a brilliant way. They were so efficient in getting us to like him and his little sister. Now we know shell suffer and her brother will never come home.   Even more weight is added when you remember what exactly Fredericas power is. She saw it coming. Thats why she wanted the picture of them together. Even at the moment she was bonding with him about how Shin is a sourpuss she saw his end. Im still amazed by how well adding a kid sister has actually made the show even better.   Looking forward to more crippling depression to come. Lets see how much sadder it can get  Notes  - Small character things I like with Frederica are the fact that she's the only one who calls him Shinei  the zeal in which she does her role as a mascot  her bear now has a pocket with even more bear stuff  and how well she flips between her cute brat self and being more serious.   - Sadly Eugene drew the Goose card.   - Love the symbology of having them continue their mission at the place they were found. Shin gets his gun and Fido back  the 86 that fell before them are honored  and they can finally move forward to the end.   - Im still wary of Giad  but so far theyre not assholes. Its easy for them to be better than the Republic  but they so far seem like decent people who are at least trying to care about them. It was solid of Ernst to give Shin his gun back. their new commander seems cool. Even random solider on the battlefield was at least trying to be nice  even if it was a bit performative. Im a little more relaxed. Not saying theyre totally on the up and up  but theyre not as bad as I thought.   - I live for the Shin and Frederica sibling moments. Both the cute (like the mushroom scene) and the sad (like telling her to close her eyes before he puts Eugene to rest). Great dynamic.
3069,These are the three main reasons:  1. I just don't like the fantasy genre in that LOTR style. I'll join in when that's what the group want to do  but I'd rather be playing most other settings. Luckily it's nearly always non-fantasy on the menu.   2. The call of Cyberpunk. I could see a group at another table playing that  which was soooo much more my thing. It was a no-brainer. Then it was various other interesting games.   3. I really hated the problem solving and reasoning in AD&D (It was 1st and 2nd edition). Sometimes I'd declare and action or suggest a solution to a problem using real life logic. This would be wrong in AD&D  where solutions were geared more towards the mechanics  stylised logic and the party roles by race and class. This is very frustrating when you're new (as I was towards the end of the 80's) and trying to be useful. It's quite different in a game set in the modern day and our world where if you follow real world logic and nuances and consider real world consequences you'll be right.  WOD Mage is one of my favourite games that I never get tired of. I like the way that the adventures feel more personal to your own PC and how it's OK to make the character choices that feel right to you  even if other characters want to do something else. AD&D is more suited to always being a good team player and going with the flow.
3070,These crooks and milkers should start making massive/modular CPUs with integrated graphics on the level of rx6700 or rx6800 even.  Should cost as a rx6800 at current prices  but you get a CPU inside - which miners cant use  even if they buy these for the integrated graphics.  Whats this cucking that we always HAVE TO HAVE dedicated GPUs for high perf gaming... time to blow up the integrated graphics market already!
3071,These games were good when they came out.   I dont really feel the need to re-play them. Id like new games.   A shared universe game with Niko  Trevor  Paddy  Tommy  Carl and Claude would be a blast. Hell  put Arthur in it for laughs.
3072,"These games would be better  in my opinion  if they stopped at about level 10 instead of 20  reduced the trash encounters and had fewer yet more impactful battles.     [The age of decadence](https://store.steampowered.com/app/230070/The_Age_of_Decadence/) is short on a per run encounter and on the side of being almost too short per run. I would consider that POE 1 without DLC is just entering the  ""this is too long and I am starting to fatigue"" area  Pathfinder kingmaker goes beyond that and into ""WTF is this"" region.  >it's about to end I'm bored and exhausted nearly lost the track of story either gonna abandon the playthrough or force myself to fight that boring final boss        So I'm confused whether I picked wrong titles (for my taste)   I have the same issues and I have been playing C-RPGs since Fallout 1 was new. My current POE 1 run is suffering from the same thing you describe  despite me putting extra RP effort into it. Part of it  these games sometimes have too much content and part of it is the players problem. Feeling like you have to to do everything and see everything  finish every quest  talk to every NPC  can really extend the play time.  I think POE 1 can be finishes in less than 15 hours if you just hit the big quests and are experienced.  &#x200B;  >at first I'm fascinated everything seems mysterious and interesting  Obviously this is just my opinion  POE 1 gets better and better right up to the end of act two where it starts falling apart and starts to drag. White march 1 was great though.  POE 1 really should have been three acts  and it is paced pretty slowly.      >combat gets repetitive and I'm realizing that game isn't as deep as I thought  Controversial opinion time  RTWP should be limited to a party of 4  max. Way too much going on to keep track of your 6 party members and the 6+ enemies.  &#x200B;  >   >   >Underrail  Wasteland 2  Pillars of eternity  IWDEE  Atom RPG  Fallout 1  Under-rail is ok I guess  WL2 suffers from a lot of issues  still solid.  POE 1is long for its own good and trying to manage 6 people can be too much for many. Played IWD 1 and 2  enjoyable. Haven't played Atom RPG.  Fallout 1 is awesome. Looks like you picked some solid games  burn out and fatigue happen to most of us I would wager.  &#x200B;  > if anyone has faced the same issues maybe give me an advise how to handle fatigue better or maybe suggest me another titles to play which you think is better designed than those I stated above.  I find that getting into the game and really putting thought into my characters  who they are and why they do what they do helps. Playing on ""story time"" isn't a sin  some of these games just have too much combat to wage through.  &#x200B;  The age of decadence is shorter  its also very hard. Its got a great setting and story  you will have to play 2 or 3 times to sort of piece all together."
3073,These things are semi-popular where I am (partially thanks to the badge)  but I'm not certain how they compare to compact minivans from 'economy' brands. This new one could use a shorter grille  but it's kinda alright.  But 326 horsepower in a compact MPV? Hybrid  yes  but that's quite uncommon for this type of vehicle class. Do an M for the memes.
3074,"They are terms that can overlap. Frequently  ""job"" is more common in JRPGs while ""class"" is more common in western RPGs. I believe the Final Fantasy series popularized the whole ""job"" thing. It's also somewhat common in JRPGs to allow your characters to change jobs  while in most western RPGs you're stuck in the same class you started in. Otherwise  they can be very similar or very different depending on the game."
3075,They brought USB-C to the new iPad Mini  so I guess it's not too far fetched. They would have to make the phone thicker and by consequence heavier though  I'm not sure a USB-C connector would fit in the current iPhone body.
3076,They called him Killer Shark  which is not the characters name. This seems fake  and I sincerely hope it is as the art itself looks like a serious downgrade over the last squad movie.  Edit: Only now realizing this is a game not a movie. Seems a lot more plausible now.
3077,They don't want any FWD coupe  they want an Integra Coupe.  The Integra Coupe is widely considered the best handling FWD car made for its time and potentially even now. Definitely better than some RWD coupes.
3078,They find the body of someone who has been scared to death. In a bag or pouch they find a bottle of red eye drops  complete with dropper. The corpse's eyes are stained red.   The eye drops extend normal sight to the edge of the spirit domain. Ghosts and other ethereal creatures can be seen  but it is not a sight for the fainthearted.  The corpse may be any sex or age and is in the house in whatever capacity advances the plot - perhaps a paranormal investigator or a shaman or a priest.
3079,They need to do something about that notch good lord. I got an LG G8x as a temporary phone and having that tiny teardrop is SOO much better. I was intending on waiting for under display cameras to take off  but it looks like mainstream phones won't be getting those for another 2 years at least due to quality concerns  so pixel 6 here I come?  If the iPhone could do something about that notch (finger print sensor anyone?)  and add USB-C  I'd get one. Those are the only things keeping me from getting one now that they have high refresh screens.
3080,They run various charity type things that are supposed to help people with problems. Like meetings for alcoholics anonymous  drug addict recovery  etc. When they are actually collecting the names and info on those who attend. Some are targeted for future recruits  others as potential sacrifices that nobody will ever miss if they disappeared.   Working as attendants for various hospice services. Loosely hiding the fact that they are a cult that exists to help those who are dying have a few last peaceful moments on earth so if they are discovered they appear to be helping. But in reality they are draining the souls of those in their care to fuel their rituals.
3081,"They share the same fundamentals: the class/job you chose will give you access to a given array of equipment  spells  abilities  stat progression  etc...  However  they differ in that when you choose a ""class""  it's set in stone for an entire playthrough whereas a ""job"" can be changed at will  either from the start or once you unlock it. That's how I differentiate these systems."
3082,They will lose a chunk of sales if they lose the naming right. I worked in a gamestop for years and the amount of people who autobuy the new Fifa is insane. There are so many people buying Fifa games that has no interest in the gaming industry at large who pretty much auto buy the new Fifa every year.   That brand is ridiculously powerful in europe at least  losing that would cost them millions.
3083,They're considered a very budget 4WD Ute option here in Aus. Top spec Cannon is $4xK here. I don't see many on the roads which suggests to me they're not selling too well. Despite the top spec Ranger and Hilux costing almost twice as much  it's seems people would much prefer them as they're the number one and two selling car here. I remember horror stories in the earlier Great Wall models  downright awful crash safely ratings and it seems they've improved in that sense to what level  who knows.
3084,Theyre counting all the free giveaways from Epic and subscription additions to Game Pass and PS+ along with all their fans they ripped off for the next gen release too Im assuming.  Remedy can get f*kt.  Also  their RTX mode on PS5 is garbage during actual gameplay and really only benefits photo mode stans.
3085,Thinking this over myself  tried using my personal account for personal and have an account for the game  annoyingly my personal one has more followers  but the mix of content makes for horrible engagement. Mostly thinking of dropping any random personal stuff from the personal account and use it more for talking about gamedev.
3086,This anime has really become one of my favorite isekai's very quickly.  Like it seems pretty clear that Will is pretty god damn OP  personally I'm fine with that. Because so far it's managed to have that and be respectful to the viewer.  Like we have had moments of action  but nothing crazy  and meanwhile we are getting a character driven story with strong world building  personally that's what makes this special to me.
3087,"This comes up a *lot* in Savage Worlds  where the official answer is ""add two die types""  but unofficially you see people say ""+2dt"" and ""+2d"" a lot. (The latter is rarely confused for adding extra dice because it's easy to tell intent from context.)"
3088,This comment doesn't belong here but ever since I was a boy  I've had this very long and amazing story  all in my head that I never bother writing down. The way it works is multiverse theory. One universe blows up  another takes it's place. Every of piece of fiction I've watched has added to that story. Yes  that includes hentai. Sometimes it's a really addition  like make my world as horrible as possible to encourage more conflict but I never stopped the story. I ended stories  even gave characters happy endings but I just made another world with the same scenario.  The point here is that you can learn to enjoy something as well as use it for inspiration. Your enjoyment of the thing might be even be inspiration. It's simple  if you think this needs to be added to the game  watch the whole thing then simply re watch it to note down all the ideas. It's what I do and maybe I've lost my marbles  I do occasionally mutter to myself  but maybe it'll help you.
3089,This comment is probably too late to see daylight but anyway  While I am NOT a Tesla fanboy at all and I think the Taycan is excellent  this is a dumb headline  The model S is relatively mature and I think of it as saturated   Most people who want or wanted a mode S have had what  7 years to buy one?  And a LOT of people who wanted the model S but were young or couldnt afford one at release  and NOW are in the position to afford one  also go for the model X or the model 3 (because the 3 debatably satisfies all the things that make a model S desirable for a lower price)  Basically Tesla outcompetes its own model S with diverse offerings in the model 3 and model X. It would be WAY more illuminating to compare Taycan sales to S+X sales or even S+X+3 sales (even tho the 3 is cheaper) OR to compare Taycan sales to S sales 6-12 months after the S launched (which would also be imperfect as Im pretty sure the Taycan is way more available  from a supply standpoint  than the S was for its first year)  Edit: in fact  after thinking about this and given these factors  I think 1 S for every 2 Taycans is actually somewhat impressive. Again to be real I hate musk and Tesla even though the products are good  Double edit: after reading the article its an even dumber headline. The S and X debatably serve the same demand (premium performance electric) in pretty much the same price range and so should both  together  be directly compared to the Taycan. And the article states clearly that Porsche ships 2 taycans for each S or Xso therefore it ships about 2 taycans for every 2 S+X which is how it should be compared   So while the headline seems to be a cheap shot at Tesla  what the article is actually saying  that the headline ignores and that the numbers support  is really that Tesla is knowingly letting the S slump. They probably make a higher margin on both the 3 and X  and even if not  theyre selling so many it just doesnt matter if Porsche is outdoing them on just just an individual model comparison
3090,this does go side by side with the recent LG Ultrafine Ergo 32 IPS which pretty much has all the pro features for an infrared price of 800$ with hardware calibration and lut storage.   Im pretty sure LG tried its best to take down this monitors price
3091,This game surprised me at how fun it was. Plus the whole story was unique in its own way and I actually stopped to read all the stuff laying around and watch all the videos too. Cant wait to see how they build upon and expand the universe.
3092,This game took me 3 attempts to get into but once I made it past Act 1 I was absolutely hooked. Rough start probably turned a lot of people away  and Owl Cat only has themselves to blame  but once it got going I couldnt put it down.
3093,This goes back to 2005. Here's the article that explains it. https://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=5160090  TLDR: Marketing wants you to say that you drive a Cadillac and not just say the model.
3094,This happened to me once  the issue was failing to load the os  i had just changed the SSD and apparently the SATA port i was using/SATA cable were not ok  i changed it to the previous port +cable and all was good  to this day i still have a bad port/cable  but i have 2 extra
3095,"This happens to a lot of people trying to break into CRPGs  and my advice is always the same: don't overthink it. It's rare to bumble things up so badly that you won't be able to complete a game on normal difficulty  and by the time most CRPGs start becoming difficult  you've been playing it for long enough to have an idea of what you need to be doing.  Pathfinder in general is an odd duck because it takes what's standard in most CRPGs and unnecessarily breaks things down more than they need to be. There are ""correct"" choices when choosing traits  and a combination of a few of them generally equates to just one perk or trait in other games. It gives you ""freedom"" because you can very well choose what traits you'd like  but there are right and wrong options for specific setups and the unnecessary bloat of Pathfinder's systems confuses people and turns them off.   Try to go into CRPGs with a general idea of what you're trying to accomplish in mind and then stick to that. Spellcasters generally need Intelligence (unless otherwise indicated ) beefy frontliners need Strength  sneaky stabby agile types need Dexterity  etc. And then just make skill/trait/perk selections based on those things. If you're feeling overwhelmed  just stop worrying about min/maxing every little thing. Making the ""perfect"" character only tends to matter on harder difficulties or challenge runs. Just get in there and have fun!"
3096,"This happens to me after after working long hours doing game dev. I simply never get tired and end up laying in bed tossing and turning for hours. I tell myself I ""should"" go to bed because it's ""late"".  What I've found is just listen to your body. You will eventually want to sleep (whether it's 6am the next day or 6pm the next day).   I've always found game dev to be best when inspiration is striking and maybe you are similar to me where that always seems to happen in the middle of the night . IMO if it's not hurting anyone just stay up and keep working  obviously only if you want to though!  If you have to sleep at a certain time due to responsibilities the next day then I recommend what others have posted  giving yourself plenty of time to ""wind down"" before trying to sleep. Yoga/Meditation help loads with trying to re-center / re-frame your mind."
3097,"this has been brought up before but i'd definately like a ""scooch please"" toned horn and a ""okay bud ya almost just killed me there"" tone. The horn on my audi errors on the side of ""I'M ANGRY AF"" so i tend to not use it unless it's an emergency. tooted it at my maintence guy when i first got it and nearly gave him a heart attack. on the other hand I don't think anyone has ever noticed the horn on my 15 civic. maybe an adjustable horn volume knob lol"
3098,"This has been going on a long time  so it's not really new.  But my opinion is the same as it's been for a while now: I find them deeply  immensely dull.  The idea of playing an RPG ""set in the star wars universe"" or ""in avatar"" or ""in game of thrones land"" or even in middle earth is not interesting or exciting to me whatsoever.  Those settings were designed as a backdrop for their protagonists/antagonists (or for some languages if you talk about middle earth).  They were not designed for the player agency of roleplaying games."
3099,This Intellivision Amico is going to make the Ouya look like a PS4 in terms of sales.  It still haven't even answered the biggest question of why get this system over a Nintendo Switch. That system is family friendly. All the mainstream systems have family friendly titles as well.
3100,This interests me in the future. I mostly currently work alone (working on my own engine) but at some point figuring out effective teamwork is going to be important to me.  The only thing I know that might be useful to you is check out some game jams  most of them run discords and people will be forming adhoc teams on their for each jam. Basically this will help you meet people interested in being part of a team and screen out those who are not compatible with your flow.   I have an overthetop easy to get along with personality so even though I only work alone for now  I get plenty of invites to join teams (I'm uniquely ambivert). Put in some consideration about your personality  how you communicate what you need  and how you help other teammates communicate what they need  and figure out how you will deal with conflict. As long as everyone feels the process is fair enough  it is fair enough  and that is the best you can do.  Good luck! Good Luck!
3101,"THIS IS (almost certainly) NOT THE PLAID PLUS.  Tesla specifically said that they planned to go back to the Ring with a Plaid that would have some common modifications  stuff that people could get from third parties and put on their cars themselves without Tesla getting involved.  It's rumored(but not confirmed) that those runs would happen in conjunction with the software unlock of the actual top speed of the vehicle and probably some kind of ""Track Mode"" software package similar to what you get on the Model 3 Performance.    The Plaid Plus was supposed to have more range  which would have in turn have required more HP to maintain a 0-60 time of under 2 seconds.  Then they cancelled it because of constraints regarding cell production and above-expectation improvements in charging speeds.    I have heard *nothing* about a change in policy on that front  so the most logical conclusion is that this is just what Tesla said they would test next - a ""normal""(if that word makes any sense with a car like this) Plaid with improved tires  brakes  suspension bits  spoiler and some extra software goodies."
3102,This is a drop in the rom/emulation scene bucket. Nintendo won a battle here  but the way I see it  much like Napster  the damage has already been done  and Nintendo is fighting a war that is gonna be long and fruitless for them  especially if they keep suing people that can barely scratch thier losses and legal fees.  My peers  keep your eyes open for when valve drops its handheld  because unless valve limits its capacity to run emulation in some way  shit is about to get real  and it will be interesting if companies like Nintendo and Sony will try to hold Valve responsible for any percieved damages.
3103,This is a mechanic i miss on a action rpg game like this. I recently played nioh 2 and was a really fun mechanic of the way that you Dodge attacks. I've almost 50 hours on dragon's dogma and i don't discovered a way to Dodge also run or hold At the giant enemy.   Sorry  if my english is so creepy i am from brazil.
3104,This is a pretty rough start IMO.  I dont know if its me being a cynical prick but theres just a noticeable lack of energy from the OP to the chase scenes and even the explosions themselves lack some kick.  Maybe someone more eloquent than me can put it into better words but thats my take on it.  At least the OP theme sounds bitchin and the new characters are cool. Also  it would be interesting to see what the fuck is going on between Lily and Lupin
3105,This is a real shame  never used them  but always heard good reviews from them.  Not surprising though  recent Intel and AMD CPUs come very well optimised and pushed nearly to the limits of the silicon for stable 24/7 use out the box.
3106,This is a really off topic question... Is there any game mechanic or design that can incentify keeping real live object alive.   I was watching Humanimal documentary  about poaching... And was wondering if we can design a game to make keeping animal alive more profitable than killing them...
3107,This is absolutely fascinating. The applications that this chip has been largely implemented in seems to confirm its position as a low power design  even though Zhaoxin and Via claims differently. Interested in seeing what they'll come up with next
3108,This is awesome  though I am afraid not too many people will use this since most 5000 series cards have probably hone to miners. This is because they have much more mining performance than the 6000 series and therefore goes for more on the used market. Therefore many people have effectively traded their 5000 series card for a 6000 series card for free if not sometimes a little profit.
3109,This is awesome Im definitely going to check it out!   Are you using GAS in this project or rolling your own system?  If not using GAS  did you do any client side prediction for abilities or buffs/debuffs? This is something Id love to see someone elses implementation of.
3110,This is because the LCD screen is mounted for landscape  so when holding it in portrait  the linear redraws go vertically instead of horizontally. I dont understand why they didnt expect users to handle this vertically for reading most of the time.  Edit: This is a good video showing the jelly scroll effect on different tablets (ipads and a samsung tablet)  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0k1-qUehmpE  It also confirms that the screen redraw direction of the new mini is vertical  compared to the bigger ipads that have it horizontally.
3111,"This is came out to be a longer text about my creative troubles. I might mixed up some semantics  please pardon this  since english is not my native language.  So I try to explain my situation to the best of my ability  part to get it from my chest  but really still hoping though that someone somehow might have an idea what happened to me and has a kind of solution or remedy.  I used to GM for about 30 years now  and before that always had a thing about all things fantasy  Froud/Gillianesque weirdness and escapism. When I was introduced to RPG in my teens it seemed like a godsend to me.  I used to be a very cocky DM with a solid reputation in our local circles  who loved to experiment a lot  and was aways dead sure in my ability to deliver dramatic and exciting sessions  mostly all coming from a intuitive place I can't describe.  I often used a fashion of being prepared with structured notes  (for a safety net  mind training or ""set pieces"")  but scattering the stuff to the winds if an opportunity for something exciting might come up during play.  Well now. Since about 5 years  and really I think even more  I think that special place dried up for me. I feel very empty  like used to have the proverbial spark  and then lost it. I loved to GM.  I read about DM burnout  I tried out what I see suggested  had many and extended breaks  played as player  went through a lot of game systems  genres and settings  including from more structured rules-and-dice to more freeform like FATE systems. I have looked for changes in inspirations  tried different prep style  goal orientations  writing styles and gaming and writing philosophies.  Truth to be told  I'm really afraid to pick up my pencil (also cards  keyboard  generator  random tables) and create anything. I have trouble to come up with ideas. The last few years is doing published adventures and going of the rails here and there. I haven't gamed with a gaming group since a bit more then a year now. I lost pretty much most of my confidence I had.  The thing is  I have trouble coming up with anything that will connect with anything in my mind and feel organic. It mostly feels dumb and boring. I stare at published adventures or at 3-sentence-adventures people post online and think to myself ""OMG of course how did they do it!?!""  And also sincerely  ""why could they do it?"" And ""why can't I anymore?""  I can't identify significant factors in my life that changed. My wife and kids are great. Yes work sucks  but it did before  and so did university before that.  The part that brings me mostly down is that my daughters took up gaming when my brother introduced ""No thank you Evil"" to us  about a year ago. We played it  and my kids loved it to bits.  We breezed through the written adventures  and I tried to come up with some ideas for adventures.  and just can't. I know what they love  what shows and books and movies inspire them  and I cant make it work. I have everything MCG produced on NTYE and then some. I flip "
3112,This is embarrassing  but my history with Final Fantasy franchise can be catalogued this way:  * It looks interesting  but why is it called Final Fantasy? Because it's the last one? That sucks. I don't want to love the last game in a series. I'll skip it * Why would the last game in a series get a sequel. That makes no sense. I'll skip it * Wow  there's a lot of these things. No one seems to be objecting to the ridiculous titles. What's wrong with these people * Coworker won't shut up about his new PS3. He asks if I can house/dog sit  and suggests I check out the PS3. I'll say yes for the dog * Ok  PS3  I'll check it out. Which game...Oh look  Final Fantasy. Bunch of them. Which one...some of these are PS2 games I guess. Well  obviously people like this one since it was released in separate parts. I'll try...this one.  * What the heck? A music video? Is it a pop idol simulator? I thought I'd be fighting things  I don't want to go on concert tour. (20 minutes later) Oh  this is intolerable. Final Fantasy fans are lunatics  &#x200B;  (Years go by)  &#x200B;  * Hey look  Steam has Final Fantasy I on sale. I'll check it out * Hey this is actually pretty good
3113,This is exactly how I run games. I setup a small Discord server with about a dozen people built around the idea of trying new things out. Games are drop in/drop out  so folks join when they want to play  and I rotate through one shots and short arcs (3-8 sessions). The key is the systems of choice can be learned very quickly  and typically have free or cheap options available  so the financial investment is minimal. Ill occasionally take player suggestions for stuff to run  but I put out a schedule with what I want to do  and folks can choose whether or not its something theyre interested in.   Every session is built around the idea of being a complete experience  so we get quick into the action and dont bother getting bogged down with the type of stuff that soaks up a lot of time. The folks I tend to play with are more interesting in the RP aspects rather than getting deep into the mechanical  so they can get invested in characters quickly  even if they wont be using them very long. Player investment is maintained because sessions are usually a chaotic mess and are just a fun time  but the key is that everyone who joins in is already onboard with how I run games  and its usually not their primary weekly game.
3114,"This is going to sound rude  but ...  It's not surprising a ""web"" developer is hitting roadblocks.  Web development is the easiest type of development out there.  Most developers who do nothing but web development aren't nearly as skilled as they imagine themselves to be.  Keep at it  grow  and one of these days you might stop self-identifying as a web developer  but rather as a developer who can also do web development."
3115,"This is indeed good advice and why it is rather sad when I hear people say ""I tried playing D&D but it was too complex and took too long to prepare and read the rules so I gave up on all RPGs forever"".  Edit: clearer words"
3116,This is misleading.  He got fired after those posts surfaced among the community.  What it fails to mention though  is that he was shit at his job and gave the company extremely bad PR with his community interactions.
3117,This is more of a US centric thing  but EVs with swappable batteries. Tesla did a half assed attempt and failed. Meanwhile  in China  [NIO has 500 battery swap stations and over 4 million cumulative swaps](https://www.nio.com/blog/current-state-ev-battery-swapping). They're planning on opening a swap station in Norway too. It is a battery subscription service  so you get to choose which size battery you want. You don't have to worry about someone else's degradation since [choosing a certain kwh subscription plan means you get that kwh](https://www.nio.com/baas). It also allows for a huge cost reduction off the msrp and resale value since you technically don't own that battery and the wear and tear that it accumulates (which is a good and bad thing). Paying a subscription on a vehicle doesn't sound great when you think of things like BMW's heated seat debacle  but if you consider the monthly cost of gasoline  it makes sense for a lot of people. Battery swapping probably isnt valuable for people who can charge at home  but its great for those without access to charging as of now.  The commercial vehicle industry is [exploring](https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2021/apr/29/swap-and-go-electric-trucks-to-run-between-sydney-and-brisbane-using-exchangeable-batteries) it because you get an EV that fills up as fast or faster than a gas/diesel tank and not have to worry about [degradation](https://www.epiroc.com/en-us/products/parts-and-services/batteries-as-a-service). Would be nice to see it in the [car market](https://www.caranddriver.com/news/a35717014/ample-battery-swapping-station/) too.
3118,This is more of my inner tech nerd side showing  but I wished that cars in the 2000s that had LCD screens you could plug stuff into had Component video inputs. Pretty much every car that had one in the 2000s only had a Composite input - and then cars went straight to HDMI in the 2010s. It annoys me because Component looks ***way*** better than Composite  even on shitty 2000s LCD screens.
3119,This is my 2nd year doing track days. Ive done 7 so far as well as a bit of sim racing  and these are some random lessons things I learned. Longer than I expected it to be  but I kind of enjoyed putting it together. They might not all apply to you but I figured Id share them anyways.  Preparation/organization - Bring a folder to keep all of your paperwork in one place (e.g. tech inspection forms  track day insurance  course maps/handouts) - Make an actual check list of things you want to bring  and check them off the day of. Its easy to forget something as obvious as your helmet. - Bring plenty of snacks  water  a comfortable chair  and clothes for whatever weather you might expect. Bring a bag for your trash.  - Spend a decent amount of time getting familiar with the track in advance - watch videos  look up some course guides  play it in sims. - Make a list of the things you want to do in between sessions (e.g. check lug nut torque  tire pressure  oil/coolant temps). Its easy to forget about this when youre pumped up in adrenaline coming straight off the track. - Do some research on what tire pressures work for your car on the track  bring a tire pressure gauge and adjust as the day goes on. This should really be the only thing you should have to adjust on your first track day. - Read the forums for your car to find car-specific prep  deficiencies  or just things to keep an eye on.  - Remove everything from your car interior the night before. Youll probably be required to do this as part of tech  and its just easier to take care of it ahead of time. - Locate the gas station nearest to the track  and make a mental note of it if you pass it on the way. Its nice to just know where it is. - Clean your windshield. - Join the Facebook group for the organization that sponsors your event  and feel free to introduce yourself. I got some of the best instruction Ive received by making a post that it was my first time on that track  and I wanted to do some ride-along laps with someone if they were open.   Logistics - Top off your tank at the closes gas station on the way to the track.  - Arrive as early as you can. Unpack and get the tech inspection out of the way early. Its nice to just sit back  drink a coffee and get yourself mentally sorted out/explore the paddock. - Youll probably be a little or a lot exhausted/fatigued at the end of the day  make sure you factor that in for your drive home. A lot of people skip the last session or two if they have a long drive back home. If you have a prescription for Adderall  that can be very helpful for the long drive home. If not  coffee and/or meth which is apparently the same thing as Adderall.    On-track - DO NOT USE YOUR PARKING BRAKE WHEN YOU FIRST COME OFF THE TRACK. Apparently your pads and rotors are hot enough to fuse to eachother. Ive never done it  or seen it happen but it sounds likes a mood-killer. Probably a good idea to bring some wheel chocks  although Ive never actually had to use mi
3120,This is my very first rodeo with a Lupin series  so feel free to grill me if what I'm saying comes more from a place of ignorance (not necessarily solely about Lupin itself).  It's the first episode  and we have had a car chase in the city with bazookas  cars flying  exploding  flying again  doing somersaults  getting their roof cut off. And a tanker full of oil exploding  and a motorcycle flying through the burning fuel pretty much unscathed. I guess it was overwhelmingly over-the-top for me. Is this what the general tone is like?
3121,This is nice if it happens but I wanna see a remaster of the original game and Quake II originally released on N64 as I had it for that console. The remasters should be available for current consoles.   A Quake movie or series would be welcomed by me too despite video game based movies typically are not good at reaching expectations.
3122,This is one of the reasons I prefer point-buy systems for character creation. As a player  I don't have that awkward feeling someone will think I cheated if I show up with a lucky character. (I know players who INSIST on rolling in front of the DM for this very reason.)  And as a GM I don't have to worry about cheating  since since anyone can audit their six point build at a glance.
3123,This is part of what Agile/Scrum development helps with. First  identify all the tasks that need to be finished. Then  estimate how long those tasks would take. Then  fit all those tasks in your projected timeline. If it doesn't fit  you'll have to see what tasks you can leave on the proverbial cutting room floor. This process takes practice and experience  but is the closest methodology software developers have to reducing scope. Unfortunately  most developers are not very good when it comes to estimations.
3124,This is passenger cars ofc.    Funfact: In 2020 the Porsche Taycan sold 1220 units or 1% of total new cars in Norway  that's more than they Cayenne has sold there since 2003. They'll sell close to 2000 units this year.
3125,This is real interesting. I like the crunchy classic games but they are very narrowly focused on combat and setting. But i really like narrative/emotion/relationship building games. I want the in between. Maybe using a narrative game for interesting downtime and story dynamics stuff and a crunch game for adventures and battle. Haha
3126,This is really disingenuous and a really bad comparison. And everyone in the comments on shitting on Tesla without being properly informed. They compared the 2021 sales of the Taycan with the 2021 sales of the Model S  even though the first 2021 produced Model S was delivered in the end on June.  Porsche sold [8810] (https://insideevs.com/news/540897/porsche-taycan-sales-2021q3/) Taycans globally in Q3  whereas Tesla sold [9275](https://ir.tesla.com/press-release/tesla-q3-2021-vehicle-production-deliveries) Model S/X in Q3 (which only consist out of Model s because X is not in production yet.  Tesla is currently ramping the production of the refreshed Model S  so looking at these numbers and saying that demand for the Model S is dead is incorrect.  I'm willing to bet that in 2022  the Model S will sell far more units globally than the Porsche Taycan.
3127,This is so utterly and incredibly stupid that I can't believe a big company would actually move forward with it.  Plus you'd need a nation-wide campaign to inform people and you'll still have thousands with burning briefcases and dead batteries at critical moments.
3128,This is the basis for one of my gaming groups; we will change systems each story cycle. I don't really take too much heed to belly-aching about learning a new system  because no matter what mountain they need to traverse  I will have to do the same journey many more times.   That's kinda my right; I put in 5x more work than they do  so they can't complain too much. It's there in the contract.  > The vicious cycle for me is that I get really exited about a new game that I've found  trying to sell my players on it  start playing  lose enthusiasm few sessions in  find a new game  start over.  That said  this would be _highly_ obnoxious. Per the above  you can't expect players to be invested and interested if you are not yourself.  As advice; once you start narrowing on a game  stop looking for other games. Just stop it. Recovering crack addicts will not recover in a crack-den. Recognize that GMs  like players  grow into systems. If you think you have a game down in 1-3 sessions  you're lying to yourself.  You should be as interested in the story your game is telling as the nuts-and-bolts of the rules (and maybe that's where its going wrong). Immerse yourself in that game and genre. Read some modules  read some tangential fiction. Most GMs I know do not consume much media around their games  and it boggles my mind how they function.  Then set yourself and your players an expectation for how long the game will last.  It'll be easier to get to the end if you know where the exit is. Our rule is that the campaign is going to last a minimum of 10-15 game-nights (we go longer  if we're still interested)  unless the party isn't feeling it decides to call a no-confidence vote.
3129,This is the new power states called S0ix instead of the old standard like s3(sleep) and s4(hibernate). In the new method the OS handles disabling everything. Incidentally on the BIOS of some laptops you can switch back sleep mode to the old method (e.g. Lenovo call it Linux mode sleep).
3130,This is the whole point of prototyping!  Create a bare-bones version of your idea. Focus purely on the mechanics  don't worry about art or animations  just create the gameplay loop in it's most basic form.   Make one area with basic primitive shapes like cubes/spheres/cylinders so you can give yourself a change to see what the game would feel like before making a full commitment on all the work required. You will likely want to go through numerous iterations before moving beyond this stage.
3131,This is turning into one of my favourites this season.  I'm sure Takeda probably noticed her change in appearance  but is also aware she's self-conscious about her body so didn't mention it. Then catching a creep  and giving some tough justice with a Judo throw.
3132,"This is very nice looking. Too bad Ford stopped selling cars in the US and I'll never get to even consider one.  Straight from the Ford US website.    https://www.ford.com/cars/focus/  ""Unfortunately  Ford will no longer be building Focus. But you can still contact your local dealer about availability and check out our other vehicles that might be perfect for you and your family."""
3133,"This is why I've always found the complaint that AC: Odyssey requires ""tons of grinding"" to be a bizarre argument  because you get exp handed out for literally doing anything  including _walking_. If you actually play the game  you get experience  and if you even bother to glance in a direction that isn't along the main quest once or twice a day  you'll get more than enough exp to continue.  I loved exploring the whole world in Odyssey and doing every area  and would still have done so had they not given me exp  because imo they made the game itself enough of a reward. Cool areas to explore  different forts to assassinate  fully animated/voiced quests that were the same quality as the main story. It didn't need any skinner box mechanics to incentivize its content imo.  Tbh I think the real question here might be different  and relates to an even deeper type of skinner box and being rewarded as a player outside the game  or rewarded as the character in-game. Why does the act of playing the game require in-game rewards to be considered ""relevant?"" I explored and did all the icons because I thought it was fun and satisfying  not for the reward but for the act  which rewarded me as a person  not my in-game character. but it seems people need some kind of in-game reward for their character to get their satisfaction.  Is that on the devs that made gamers think that way  or is that on gamers that refuse to do any non-main content that isn't heavily incentivized in-game with pixel rewards?   Considering people consider doing _literally anything_ in game that game that isn't the main story as ""grinding""  it would seem it's the players themselves that are clamoring the loudest of skinner box mechanics  and when devs don't put them in  it's considered a fault. It's funny in Odyssey's case  because where you're saying they put too much of that in  the general playerbase seems to think there _aren't enough_ skinner box rewards."
3134,This makes me think of the study on implanting false memories where the researchers convinced the participants that the committed a crime in their past by using the Reid technique. The got the participants to confess to something that never happened. Juila Shaw did one of the most blatant of these experiments that I'm aware of.  I know what you're doing is very different  but the process of discovering what the characters did sounds very much like what they did in the study.
3135,"this may be a little controvertial  as he's not a fan of ""developers who are on reddit 8 hours a day""  but the man's got experience  >Ive been a one-man indie studio for over 20 years  sold millions of games on steam  direct  and on mac and even some console stuff. Ive arguably had 4 hit games over that period (seven figure revenue)."
3136,This may be a stupid question but  if your ECU calculates distance traveled by rotations of the drivetrain or whatever. Wouldn't non-stock smaller rims cause require more rotations of the drivetrain to travel the same distance as larger stock rims and subsequently add up kms faster? Assuming it's managed by the ECU which I would assume would calculate based on the stock wheel dimensions for calculating the travelled distance?  Let us know if this is stupid or whatever. Any replies are appreciated! cheers  edit: yeah i just mean the diameter of the wheel not the tyre or anything guys. im aware that the tyre width changes the diameter
3137,This may come as a shock to some r/cars purists  but...  * FWD is more easily manageable in all weather conditions * FWD is cheaper to produce and and cheaper to make modular platforms that can be used with several bodies (it's always about the money!)  * FWD cars can be just as much fun as RWD cars \*gasp!\* * 2 door cars look great * If you have a 2-door car with 2+2 seating (as many FWD coupes/hatches are)  you can fold the seats down for extra storage space  So if someone wants a fun  practical  easily justified  affordable car  who am I to gatekeep? Welcome to the fun car club.
3138,This may sound ungrateful but I think this episode suffered really hard from budget/lack of time  didn't quite live up to the previous episodes. Understandable for such a gorgeous adaptation to have an off episode to allocate their effort to more important episodes.
3139,This means nothing to 99% of their consumer base though. They are more than willing to make compromises in almost every department of the phone just to be able to flex the Apple name. Apple isnt a good phone manufacturer (distributer? they don't make half their parts)  they're a great marketing company.   They have fantastic cameras but are inferior to a lot of other phones in almost every single department. I wonder how much effect Google's new camera API will have on iPhone sales when Adnroid's no longer have terrible quality on social media as I assume that's a major driving factor for a lot of the younger population.
3140,This mechanic needs to be on the chopping block. The moron did not balance them.and balancing tires is easier than duck soup and should take you 1 hour tops on all 4 tires. There is no such thing as too much grip. If there was there would be road noise and that's it.
3141,This might be controversial to say and I might get down voted to hell but I feel like most people who experience trauma can see their own traumatic experiences as bad in one moment or hilarious the next. I'm not gonna say I like Your Lie In April cuz I've never even seen the whole show but I can appreciate that aspect you described.
3142,"This might not be a ""normal"" Isekai but a reverse: [Jashin Dropkick](https://myanimelist.net/anime/36906/Jashin-chan_Dropkick).  Then again id say this falls into the same area as Maid Dragon as far as grey area Isekais."
3143,This might sound weird but... your big idea kinda doesn't matter. I can guarantee that every person reading it will have their own take on how such game should look  sound and play like. And while some of these implementations would be boring shitty 1/10 games there could also be ones that sell hundreds of thousands of copies (I mean  I read it as a puzzle game with self destructing environment and limited time - aka something [like escape sequences from Ori](https://youtu.be/-hBvYAsdOxw?t=53) except with more emphasis on building things than pure jumping).    What matters are small ideas and these only really come up when you are actually working on a game. So controls  timings  how fair is the game  how many possible answers to a puzzle there will be  what kind of stuff will be thrown to thwart the player  how's the difficulty curve and so on.
3144,This next generation is in my opinion the worst looking so far. I know they usually iterate the look for a couple years with each generation but I think this one needs the most changes to look right. Its too generic right now. Doesnt really look sporty or agressive to me.   Am I alone on this?
3145,This not just a matter of the system but also of the organisation. Even rules-lite systems can be daunting to GM if you don't prepare carefully.  How much experience do you have as GM?   How good you are at improvising?   Do you use a GM Screen or Cheat Sheet as rules reference?   How do you organize your session notes?   How do you prepare for a session?

3155,This ranks right up there with putting the spare tire in the floor of the fucking bed. I'm looking forward to the day when someone has a Rivian R1T loaded up  gets a flat  and has to unload the entire fucking bed to pull the fucking spare out.  So how long before all this self-driving is actually legit L5 self-driving and included as standard  or at least reasonably priced? I'm guessing a couple of decades.
3156,This remake and remaster trend is something companies  no matter game or movie company  do to gain money with the least amount of risk. Art is risky. And the companies are not willing to have risks anymore.
3157,"This seems like just another:  ""Here's why this popular  well received car wasn't bad.""  For those that cared about the skyline heritage  it was unpopular because they went in a different direction with it and also developed the GT-R as a completely separate model.  Outside of that  it was a popular car with generally positive feedback."
3158,This seems to be a common thing  so fear not! You are not alone! Something that has helped me as a DM is to start planning the next session almost immediately after wrapping the next one. I end the game  we do the post game talk (solid thing to do) and I either chat with my co-dm for a while about upcoming stuff  or work on it on my own. Something that engages a different part of my brain like drawing (or hunting for) maps  looking at monsters  listening to thematic music  etc. And sometimes winding down with a little casual PC gaming (Valheim has been my go-to of late) can also help. Hope these are helpful!
3159,"this show has godly direction. the voices of the chord instrumental during fido scene really put a lump in my throat.   and the way shin sighed before shooting eugene was just heartbreaking. this is the most ""normal"" they can be and it hurts my head to think about it."
3160,This sounds a lot like burnout to me. Sometimes it feels like you have to play a game cause you loved the series and a new ones coming out and if you don't play it you're going to have it spoiled etc etc. Which are valid things to want to avoid but if you force yourself to play game after game that you aren't enjoying you're robbing yourself of the enjoyment you might have later. You can completely be a rpg guy and not play every single rpg. I used to feel like this  and the only solution for me was to not game for a little while and do something completely different.
3161,"This was already a grim episode but that last scene was like ""fuck you"" territory (Eris first lost her parents  now her grandparent).  Also it was pretty convenient that Rudeus stuff was 1m away from his prison"
3162,This was not recorded or ever intended to be part of our gameplay. The audio is a result of two different Ridden growls that are playing simultaneously and when heard together sound like that word.  So  it sounds like its two different growl clips that sound awful when they cue together. I dont know much about digital audio design and barely anything about game design  but does that make it more plausible to believe it slipped through the cracks? Maybe they didnt hear these two clips play together during alpha  or maybe one of them didnt exist until recently?  Edit: do lots of people in this community believe overt racism isnt a thing and theres no way such a thing could happen intentionally? Then why is this even a story?
3163,This was one of the biggest hidden gems ever. Id not heard much about it then I played it and it was amazing  one of my al time faves now. If you haven't played it you should  its one of the best games in recent times
3164,This was so exciting when it was first released as it was a departure from the 8-bit-like colors  the flat landscapes  the Trent Reznor Moody soundtrack. This game was groundbreaking at the time in every way.
3165,This was the Group A era of motorsport that cemented my interest in cars - where you could see production based machinery from a little BMW M3 all the way to these hulking big V12 Jaguars and all sorts of things between racing for the win on the same circuit in the same race.  Then the local manufacturers got bitter about being shown up by the imports  and created a set of regulations that were designed purely to tilt the playing field  and then ultimately exclude everything that wasn't a Commodore or Falcon  and V8 Supercars was born.
3166,"This week shirabii made two illustrations!  [Grethe](https://twitter.com/shirabii/status/1449374743337979907)  [Eugene and Nina...](https://twitter.com/shirabii/status/1449397998685876225)  Related to Eugene  last week Asato [tweeted](https://twitter.com/Asakura_Toru/status/1447221209473552385) about his character in her episode threads  here's the [translation:](https://twitter.com/TheZackZeal/status/1447313136088911877)  >Shin's first friend in the Federacy. When creating Eugene's character  he was given two traits. ""An older brother with glasses""  to evoke Rei  and a ""serious  diligent Alba""  to evoke Lena. He was a character meant to invoke memories of these two influential people in Shin.  Here's also the stunning CD jacket for the ending song that was revealed today: https://imgur.com/HFw3QOW"
3167,This wouldnt change much based on how I am reading it  but im sure there will be a knee-jerk reaction.  A company as big as Intel has countless customers with countless needs. There is no product that is one-size-fits-all for them  so they segment. Typically this is done via binning a ton of different dies  but also often means fusing off parts of the die. Instead of fusing perfectly good parts off to segment (which every company in this field does)  permanently limiting the chips capabilities  Intel would sell them as unlockable allowing users on a budget to buy only what they need today and then unlock the features/performance that would normally be fused off.  For example  Alder Lake will allegedly have AVX512 fused off. If I were to offer you a 12400 for $180 with no AVX512  that you could unlock later for $30 is that better for the market or do you think it would be better for everyone to pay $205 for a 12400 with AVX512 by default?   Customers get more choice  and Intel manages less SKU's and Intel gets a direct line of revenue that doesnt go through middlemen retailers. Also this is unlikely to ever come [back] to the consumer market and will just be for enterprise sales.  Personally  I think the idea is fine  but without the details its impossible to know if its a positive or negative  because it can go both ways easily. The devil will be in the details.
3168,"Tho it's great to see samsung  tsmc AND intel all fabing semiconductors.  They're not as much in a ""battle"" as they'd want you to think since they're all overwhelmed right now. But yeah a bit of competition why not  Right now ""inferior"" products like celerons are still useful to fullfill volume. Not everyone needs a dual epyc rome and quad 6900XT  a server with quadsocket and 400 xeon cores. Most boxes are probably secondhand celeron to run windows/office with a sprinkle of newly fabbed shit for contracts on support whenever a corp needs a hotline with perma 24x7 rotating support and extended warranties.  i'm wondering whether intel (along with others) shouldn't be suggested to provide paid corporate support for secondhand products  for big corporations. The more they make on corporations (where they can almost price gouge as they want large wealthy pockets without anyone lifting a finger to defend impoverished public of citizens; just pay & treat your workers well)  the more we can demand from them realworldy without endangering the corpo.  Something like truescale but extended  with more options : https://www.intel.com/content/dam/www/public/us/en/documents/pdf/intel-true-scale-hardware-maintenance-agreement.pdf  edit a citizen (a private person buying a tablet or computer or phone) will have to fight for $5  because it's a meal for many. An international megacorp  that racks in billions  can drop a 100millions without blinking for all coverage support & exchange & maintenance contracts because it gets all those issues out of their way to make stuff."
3169,Those are two questions with very different answers. Lacking education and experience is a huge deficit that is solved by gaining either education or experience. Obviously.  Having specific knowledge of one single language is very similar to having the ability to lift a heavy weight using one particular weightlifting movement. To some degree  it's only applicable in very specific scenarios where that movement is useful. But on the other hand  it is impossible to develop just that skill in isolation; without picking up other skills along the way. Getting really good at any one language  requires learning a lot of fundamentals that are the same across all languages. It's not a matter of there being One True Correct Language to learn. You need to learn the fundamentals to get good at programming.  That said  you don't need to be an amazing programmer to make games. You just need to sit down and actually do the work instead of talking about the work
3170,Those of you that play with physical terrain  what material do you prefer it be made out of?  &#x200B;  I've been doing some exploring and am curious as to what you all prefer. Whether it's the name brand Rubber/PVC  old resin casts  handmade foam  etc.  &#x200B;  What works for you  what doesn't?
3171,Three cylinders misfired  then started violently shaking every time I pressed my breaks  then was told by a mechanic that he was glad to see I was alive after driving it for 6 months  and also needed money for rent.   Miss that car so much :(
3172,"Three things  really: buy what you want  not what you need; you don't have anything to prove to anybody so drive safely and with care; and stay on top of the maintenance.  I was ""scared"" into my first two cars  and while my second performed admirably for a decade  I was still always left a little wanting when it came to just about every facet of that vehicle. It wasn't a bad choice by any means  it was just a boring  safe choice.  I also tended to drive it far more aggressively than anybody should drive a base model 2007 kia optima  and that definitely didn't contribute to making it last as long as possible. I still got ten years out of it  but at barely even 130k miles I probably could've kept it around for another 50k miles or more."
3173,Time for basic training as Shin gets to pilot the Frederacy's new unit! And he basically pilots it like a Juggernaut  impractical as that is  but still cool. Eugene lucked out getting paired with the main character.         I thought Shin was surprisingly popular with older women and then he and the rest of the team get a new commander in Kana Ueada's Grethe. You know she's a Kana Ueda character with those long black tights  and sassy voice.        It was pretty decent of the Frederacy to find the team's remnant Juggernauts and make a shrine with the name of their dead comrades. A memorial to the fallen Eighty-Six. Although the team doesn't seem to know how to feel about it  they just want to get back into the action.        But the real shocker...FIDO! He lives! And he got upgraded into a brand new spanking body! And Shin gets reunited with his best boi! Out of anything  it seems like that actually made Shin genuinely happy to see Fido again.         We're back into action against the Legion  and the Frederacy's forces are being overwhelmed...until Shin shows up in a brand-spanking new ace unit as he tears into the Legion like he hasn't missed a single step. The Reaper has entered the battlefield.        Of course Shin's reputation and demeanor still sets people off even as she's separated from the other Eighty-Six as they get transferred to other battles in need of aid  but Eugene still wants to be a friend to Shin and hang out with him. You can tell that Eugene is growing on Shin and he's coming to care about him  in his own way. That plus they can bond over little sisters  although Shin treats Frederica pretty differently than Eugene treats Nina.        But then tragedy strikes when Eugene gets torn to shreds and Shin is left with no other option but to put him out of his misery...the more things change  the more they stay the same. Shin at least showed him Nina's picture before he shot him  but Eugene's other friend Marcel doesn't seem to understand that was all Shin could do for him. And as stoic as Shin is  it seems to have effected him a little. Shin really doesn't seem okay.
3174,Time for the crooks to make some CPUs with integrated graphics on rtx3080 level... WHY NOT? they will sell more!  Even if these CPUs sell for the same $ as a 3080 now  at least you will get a CPU in the package too!
3175,Time is just the **Process**.  What you care about is the **Result**.  Find the Factors that give you the result and average them out and approximate/predict them in time and add some randomness.  If you do that it wouldn't be that different from letting it run its course.  Forget about simulating Days  you can simulate Years with this.
3176,Time period Circa 1998-2006ish Buy an E30. Any model.  Buy an E36 M3.  Get an Integra Type R and park it.  Dont marry the waitress in fishnets. Wait 5 years and marry the tall blonde haired girl from middle school that youll run into on Facebook.  Oh! Yea. Invest in Facebook ASAP. Trust me.

3178,TIP- You can add any(non-steam) game to your  steam library and use the controller support via steam to play every game via controller ;)  Tales of arise Dragon quest xi s Digimon cyber sleuth Tales of berseria Edge of eternity Scarlett nexus  Are some fun ones
3179,Titan Quest is a pretty sweet ARPG for builds. There are a lot you could conceivably go for  because you get to combine two skill trees. Made by some of the same people who made Grim Dawn  but in 2006. The one bad thing I'd say is it's really linear. Sure  you can go back and teleport to any of the towns you've been to  but I don't really see the point outside of handing in quests maybe.
3180,Title. The only nearby pharmacy only had 99% (unless I want a large container of higher amounts). Also  one of my family members suggested purifying it by boiling it to separate the alcohol from water  should I?
3181,"TL:DR - I am still a beginner indie game dev that came from web development side and although I share the same thoughts that game development is hard  I also find it challenging and intriguing at the same time  which spurs my passion to continue on it. Personally I find the making of graphics  music / sounds selections  backstory writing extremely daunting as I had close to zero prior experience with them. But hey  I learn something new everyday. (Y)   # # # #  I was a fullstack / web dev for as long as I could remember. About slightly more than half a year ago  I shifted into game development with the same mindset as OP probably had.   At the start  it was tough  a constant learning curve everywhere. I also had to make my own game graphics/model and backstory  which I had never done before.  My first engine was with Solar2D which I had spent around 3 months with. I had thought like web development  it was better to build everything from scratch as much as possible  I was wrong. It is still a good engine nevertheless but I realise that simple features such as a parallax background which could take me like half a day to an entire day to code there  can be almost instantly added with other engines. That's when I decided to move to Godot.  I ported over my codes and continued on what I was making. However  one fine day  I realized that the current game I was making just would not work out. After months of progress/re-progress  I had no choice but to scrape it due to insufficient planning and the lack of experience in game development.  I restarted with whatever I can reuse and is now on my second project. This time  with proper planning in place and that few months of experience. On Godot  everything was great until I was stuck with creating a complex feature that none of the existing guides/tutorials could help me with. It took me weeks but I finally did it while referring to a guide meant for Unity. That almost took my sanity.   At the moment  I am sourcing for suitable public domain music and sounds for my game which is yet another nightmare for me. I have also yet to create the actual art to replace the placeholders which I predict would take my last breath away  LOL.  All in all  as I have always believed: ""One needs to find the passion/motivation in the things they are doing to go a long way"". If OP decides to continue his game development progress  I hope he will be able to find his joy in it."
3182,TL:DW  A good cooler for lower watt CPUs (65W) where it competes with the NH-U12S redux. Doesn't do well with higher loads (123W)  and not ideal for overclocking as it failed GN's 200W test.  Seems like a solid budget cooler  and will be neat to see how well the Hyper 212 does against when GN gets around to reviewing that.
3183,Tl;dr: One Page scenarios like the ones in the links below  just not in the Cthulhu style.   Hey   i know that threads like this exist and i have searched through the forums quite a bit. So far i haven't really been satisfied with the things i have found so far. But i do believe that i can now explain what i am looking for well enough  so that answers from previous posts can't just be repeated.  First of i've read about games like ten candles or Dread and while they are interesting  they are not what i am looking for. The main points being that firstly i ideally don't want to buy anything and secondly i don't know exactly how the setup of the table is going to be since i am not hosting the evening  so ideally for this time i dont want to focus the game around physical things that i might not be able to use (candles  jenga-tower  etc.).   I have of course also looked at various CoC stuff that has been suggested. The thing is i am planning to use my own rules system (which is very flexible) since the players are already familiar with that. In general it wouldn't be a problem to take just any CoC adventure and just play it with my system tho. Many of the CoC adventures i have looked at however also didn't really strike me from the way they are setup  especially for the GM. I don't really like having to read 20+ pages for a one shot and from my experience  they often take more than one evening anyways. Also i feel confident improvising.   So I have found this list [https://reckoningofthedead.com/one-page-scenarios/](https://reckoningofthedead.com/one-page-scenarios/)    I really like this list  because the scenarios are setup in a nice way  conveying exactly the right amount of information for my taste. And if I don't find anything else  i might well end up using one of them. The only thing i realized i don't like so much  is actually the Cthulhu style. I don't know  the myths  the type of creatures and the...*exaggeration*? I just don't love it. I do also know that there are fantasy ones in the list  too  but i would like it to be in a realistic and/or historic setting.   Now if i was to run one of these scenarios  it'd probaly be one  where there ist a cultist doing evil stuff for a ritual or something or where the monsters don't appear until late in the game  because i am rather looking for a game  where suspense builds up slowly.   Now with that in mind  here's what i am looking for:   \- One page scenarios like the one in the link that aren't Cthulhu or Fantasy   \- Sources for inspiration for my own adventure or to hack the links above. These could be links to myths or horror creatures  etc. anything scary really  with which i could possibly just replace the reveals from the scenarios above. Or just write my own adventure using ideas i like from the various sources i have looked through by now.
3184,TL;DR: this game is not for you I think  &#x200B;  \>>>darker than light fantasy  I think Forbidden Lands fits the bill.  &#x200B;  \>>>lots of (viable) options during character creation and character progression  Not really. Power curve is quite flat in FL + most of the talents are related to wilderness exploration and survival  not combat.  &#x200B;  \>>>I also like combat with options that does not get weighed down by lots of math or tables  Maaaybe.... Combat is fast  but there aren't many options or D&D 4E style powers. Forbidden Lands is not an action game like D&D or Savage Worlds  it is imho closer to Traveller. Since PCs are fragile  and combat is quite random  they will be more open to negotiations (even with bandits and enemies)  and when use of force is inevitable  the players will likely organize an ambush to have an advantage.  &#x200B;  \>>>I prefer playing in my own (often human centric) settings  Nope. About half of the core book details the setting  from native races  local encounters  and a bestiary. Some of these would be useful for your own setting too  the encounters are easy to repaint  and the bestiary is really good.
3185,TL;DR: turns one TB4 port into 3. The upstream power delivery is 60 watts  and 15 watts each to the downstream ports. I kind of want one even though I don't have any TB4-equipped computers   This seems like it could be the ultimate laptop dock--TB4 is flexible enough you can use the 3 ports for anything you want: EGPU  displays  high speed ethernet  USB3 hub  etc.
3186,tldr: it's not silent hill...  > Abandoned definitely isnt a Silent Hill game and NME has the proof.  > Its not what people think  that its Silent Hill.  > We can finally debunk those rumours  its not a Silent Hill game.   > But as for the horror  theres not much of that to be seen. Certainly not to the same degree as Silent Hill or Alan Wake.  ...because you get out of breath *and* it has an anxiety element:  > The special thing about Abandoned is that it has a new game mechanic. > If you sprint  Jason gets out of breath and that  in turn  affects his aim. If hes afraid  hell become nervous and this will all affect how youre able to play.
3187,"TLDR: What are interesting behaviors for enemies in space combat games?  So  I'm working on an arcade-y space shooter and it's been going good! For testing and such I've programmed some AI that basically dives towards the player on an ""attack run""  dumps some ammo and when it's getting too close turns away until it's at a good distance to make another run. It also has some basic obstacle avoidance and such to not make it not all braindead and prevent it from getting stuck too easily. It honestly works pretty well and with different weapons  movement speeds  and group sizes there's already some variety there. There are also some more obvious and simple things like turrets on stations / battle ships.  However  the underlying structure of the fights is obviously always they same. And this got me thinking  what behaviors have I seen/do I like in other similar games that I could ~~steal~~ implement?   Some examples I came up with so far:   \- Elite Dangerous has fights with larger enemies (Thargoids) which people seem to enjoy. They have specific week spots  are only vulnerable to specific weapons  and the fights have distinct phases.   \- Homeworld (though not an action game) has a ship class  corvettes  that are nearly as fast as small fighter craft but that have turrets. They attempt to circle their target and keep them in sights for the turrets.  What do you think? Or  do you know who else I could ask?"
3188,TLDW; guy disassembles and swaps 2 identical iPhone parts. it's not that the iPhone is physically harder to disassemble and repair it's that Apple seemingly has disabled more features/functions than usual when you install a new screen  new motherboard  etc  even if they are all genuine  because every part is serialized and gets disabled or starts having issues. So you are more likely to need Apple to repair your iPhone than taking it to a non-ASP service center who uses refurb or 'OEM style' parts.
3189,"To anyone else making a trailer: save the game name  studio name until the end. Putting it front and center is just pure unadulterated ego. Instead of showing the customer some exciting gameplay you're taking up their time with 5 seconds of ""LOOK! I'M A GAME DEV NOW! MEEEEEEEEEEE"". No one cares. You don't matter. Product matters.  Same thing goes for long reveals  etc. People see that in multi-million dollar game or movie trailers and want to be as cool... while missing completely why it works in AAA-land and not with their asset flip base builder. Trust me  the only 'edge of the seat' happening with these types of trailers is when the customer leaves for the fridge.  This trailer takes 35 seconds to get to any gameplay. Impressive."
3190,To be fair  i expect pickup trucks on here. Pickup trucks are popular precisely in areas that are too sparse to even have a reliable taxi service  let alone public transit.   I have taken a cab service in rural Louisiana. Uber does not exist there. The inside of the cab had cigarette butts everywhere. The driver had a few too many teeth missing for his age.   If I wanted to have the semblance of a life in rural America  I'd be at risk for a DUI as well.
3191,To be fair  Iron Gods AP is very VERY dungeon crawly  with opponents that are mostly robots and aliens and whatnot.  And given it's scifi nature in fantasy land (yay for kitchen sink settings)  there's additional disjunction for many people.  While I'm happy that the AP is working out rather well for you as a GM  it honestly sounds like you either skipped on skimmed on the Session Zero.  Or at the very least  you need to revisit it.  While your lack-of-interest players may be just a bit more casual than you'd like (this is really not uncommon in this hobby)  that doesn't mean they're not enjoying the game.  Often times  players like this are into the game when it's game time  and that's it.  Outside of the session  they don't really give the hobby much thought unless they have to.  This isn't a bad thing  although it can hurt your own gumption when you have several players like this and you're the type to feed off their excitement levels.  As for the one play who clearly hates PF2e and isn't much for dungeon crawls - this happens  sadly.  Either the campaign or group is a bad fit for her.  This is exactly why Session Zero is so vital.  &#x200B;  TLDR: have a Session Zero - (re)align expectations.  Make sure everyone is on the same page about the kind of game the whole group wants.  That includes you  btw  as the GM - you need to enjoy the game as well.
3192,To be honest  one of things I didn't like in FNV was the fact  that you aren't properly rewarded for exploration. You go to a a dangerous city filled with radiation  and the most valuable thing you get is a teddy bear. Of course  you are also getting some lore informations  but not many of them. So I felt that I lost time isntead of having fun. In Fallout 4 every thing you do  gives you something you may need. A new weapon can be your new favourite toy or a source for glue. And it's all optional  nothing  forces you to do something  and if you do it  you will be rewarded. That makes a game fun  especially when devs figured out  how to reward you with either weapons and resources  or (and) some interesting stories/lore details.
3193,To clarify further  is it possible to submit a game to Steam as BOTH free and paid?   Heres an example: I want my simple game to be free to play. However  I want to provide an option for players to support the development of said game  and future games. So  I want to basically have a pay what you want type release. But with only two options: Free or $5(arbitrary). Perhaps even call it a Donators Version or something with a few extra perks (cosmetics  access to future games early  etc)  Is something like that possible on Steam? Or would Itch.io be better for that? I know they have a feature like that in place already.
3194,"To complicate things further  I know some games that refer to a class as a ""profession"".  Probably the best answer is that games are allowed to make up their own vocabulary so it's whatever they say it is.  I typically think of it like this:  * Class: role or types of things you do in combat * Job: something you do directly for pay * Profession: the thing you are when you do a job  So  the Fighter's Guild is hiring Adventurers (profession) to kill a troll (job). Be sure to have someone capable of using fire (class) so they stop regenerating. But ultimately  it's better to follow the rule book because if you do a good job with your job you can join the fighter's guild even if you're a wizard  as long as you're both professional and a class act."
3195,To expound I think they were doing some investigation about some crime(maybe) and one of the characters was asked to like show the ropes to the new guy that joined their organization(their organization is like the good guys I think). The scene was like in a street alley and there the guy was like threatening or did some crazy torture/beating to the one they caught to get him to start talking and then the newbie got super shocked when he saw it what happened  I think like it was too much for him to handle. Id also like to add the guy accompanying the newbie was like the worst to assign to take care of people he has like his own world and very irresponsible. After he finished torturing guy he left him to the newbie and disappeared leaving the newbie by himself.
3196,To get a dodge  you need to use daggers. So Strider  Ranger  Magic Archer  or Assassin. I think you might also need to unlock a skill.  To climb big enemies  just check your controller layout in your settings. I have no idea about playstation controls. But it should be the same button as for holding smaller enemies.
3197,To me  job implies that it's more likely to change over the course of the game  while class is more stable.  A job change can often be done and undone at the drop of a hat.  A class change will usually have level requirements or entail a stat down/retraining period.
3198,To me  they're fun handling  easy to control entry level sports cars with great designing that captures the attention enthusiasts interested in foreign market cars. I grew up with Hondas and VWs and admittedly still have a small fwd car I use for autocross. They're just fun to drive.   Also  try road racing in the rain in a fwd car vs a rwd car. I've never seen so many passed off corvette owners in my life lol
3199,To me the 2013-14 is the ugliest of the 2011+.  When it first came out in 2013 I loooooved but recently its become my least favorite of the 5.0 Coyote cars  I really think the 2018-19 Accord will look good for a loooong time but Ive been wrong
3200,To my dismay  game designers also like heights  probably for the same reason.  Building ledges  cliffs  narrow rope bridges.  And then the truly sadistic ones inflict on us things like Final Fantasy XIII-2's future city with the rotating beam platforms  Dark Souls 2's Brume Tower chain crossings  etc.   Just had to learn to work with sweaty palms.
3201,To my knowledge Lexus has always gone with alpha-numeric designations for all of its models but Toyota has a variety of interesting names for vehicles  including variations of crowns for it's sedan lineup. Personally I'd love to see some personality come to the Lexus brand but Idk what specific nomenclature to draw from that could translate/pronounce easily globally.
3202,To some extent  yes. But there's still pretty good courses for Game developing out there for a minuscule percentage of costs compared to a degree. Certification is nice but a professional Portfolio is the definitive proof of your worth in the end.  I'm still learning  but certainly having a coding background helps A LOT. Although Game Dev are various skills not just programming  still programming is THE central pillar of gamedev.  You don't need a degree for this  but if you can afford one  is always better to have one than not. Also can speed up the process of learning because you're getting formal education.  I'm teaching myself  and is hard  really hard. More often than not you encounter yourself overscoping projects beyond your knowledge  other times you get into some aspects that are obscure even for people that knows better. And almost all of the time you're stuck because although you know certain things  you don't know how to apply that knowledge  that's a sign that you skipped vital concepts that are required to apply that knowledge in the way that is intended.  For example: i was having trouble creating an inventory. Almost inmediatly was blocked because although i know how arrays and dictionaries worked. I don't know how to handle data. I researched data structures and value tables  now i'm confidente enough to make a simple inventory system and even a save and load system.  Thats why it's hard  most of the time you encounter problems that to solve them you need to go into a rabbit hole of concepts to just begin to grasp it's inner workings. Concepts that with formal education i could know beforehand.  Or just copypaste someone else's code  but honestly that is not self teaching.  This is just my experience  at least i think i'm constructing the house from the roof.
3203,"together with the rather cheap bearing What does the bearing have to do with it? Its a resonance of the blades. Its caused by the blades being very long and not very stiff. The same thing happens in every fan with less-stiff blades  like Scythe Wonder Snail  but you won't hear it happen in a fan with LCP blades  or otherwise very stiff blades (Nidec D1225C ""Gentle Typhoon"" for instance). On the Arctic its just particularly evident  because the blades are the longest of any 120mm fan I know of.  The closest physical comparison would be something like Coolermaster Silencio FP. At first glance  the design seems similar. However  the Coolermaster has somewhat shorter blades  and they are about twice as thick. Even despite this though  it suffers from notable resonances  but the extra stiffness causes the resonances to not be very distracting."
3204,Tons of terrible speculation on Videocardz and this thread. I posted the contents of the Digitimes piece [here.] (https://twitter.com/dylan522p/status/1441389154336604173?s=19) It's not reporting for RDNA in mobile SoCs
3205,Too bad Alder Lake won't support PCIe 5.0 for NVMe  so we wont see any consumer devices with this controller for a long time. There are no other PCIe 5.0 devices on the horizon anyway either  so we won't see any PCIe 5.0 devices in the consumer market for a long while.
3206,Top 10 (or more) anime. I really just don't understand how people can keep meaningful lists of their favourites that are that long  especially when it would include series from vastly different genres and series I haven't watched in over a decade so may feel completely different about if I watched again now.
3207,Total BS. No such thing.   Call the manager and complain immediately. Negotiate a refund or new tires. I would just give the shop the wheels if any of you are capable of removing and transporting them as they dont sound competent to lifting and servicing a vehicle.  My guess is the wheel weights weren't put on correctly if at all  or the tires are defective. Good luck!
3208,Totally agree.  Its super annoying and can make me want to quit the game altogether.  And its become so common that its a cliche at this point.   It isnt fun anymore. Lots of things can be done in an RPG  that doesnt mean they should.
3209,"Tough question.  Shadowrun is really popular as a setting  but there is a reason why one of the most common questions is ""how to run Shadowrun in XYZ system""  where XYZ is \_not\_ Shadowrun.  &#x200B;  What I know:  \- Stars Without Number is a D&D-style sci-fi game  but it has the Polychrome setting book  which details rules for Cyberpunk game. This might be the easiest change  as you are already aware of the D&D system.  \- Savage Worlds is a generic system  but Triple Ace Games created a few adventures and a free short rules supplement. (Daring Tales of the Sprawl product line). SaWo is worth a look if you are looking for an action movie system.  \- Interface Zero is a Savage Worlds cyberpunk setting. Rules are action-pulp oriented as above.  \- Shadowrun has a simplied ruleset called ""Shadowrun Anarchy"". Catalyst Game Labs has lots of modules called shadowrun missions  which are shorter  1-2 session adventures. These can be chained up to a campaign with returning NPCs and returning plots (for example season 4 is twelve adventures IIRC)  \- my favorite however is Zozer Games' Zaibatsu. It is a very-very lightweight system (from Traveller)  and has a really unique take on the genre. While most other games take place in lawless ghettos  Zaibatsu is about corporate mercenaries/troubleshooters climbing the company ladder in Neo-Tokyo. System style: less pulpy  more like noir; combat in Zaibatsu is quite random and deadly  so it is better to shoot someone in the back. Or even better  to hire someone to shoot her in the back."
3210,Toyota should buy this footage and just run it as a commercial unedited. No voiceover  no fancy editing  just pure driving.  Not that they need commercials to sell the GR Yaris. The only thing commercials would do is increase the resale value for the lucky few who were able to buy one. I'm sure Toyota is selling them at a loss and doesn't want to sell more. Like the RAV4 Prime  I don't really understand the marketing strategy  it must just be to pump interest into their higher margin products.  I wonder how the GR Corolla compares. Will that also be a loss-leading halo car  or an actual mass-produced car normal people can buy?
3211,Translated Article:    The third-generation Nissan Elgrand is still in use  but it's FWD  significantly lighter  and has evolved in terms of driving performance [New Cars of a Decade Ago  2021-03-12     Nissan Elgrand (2010: 3rd generation)    The Nissan Elgrand (2010: 3rd generation) is a king of minivan size  larger than its biggest rival  the Alphard  except for its height.   The third generation Elgrand is a FWD model based on the Tiana platform  instead of the RWD model of the previous generation. The third generation Elgrand  based on the Tiana platform  was converted from RWD to FWD and weighed up to 200 kg less than its predecessor  and both the 3.5-liter V6 and 2.5-liter straight-four models achieved significant improvements in driving performance and fuel economy.   In terms of size  the overall length and width were increased over the previous generation  but the overall height was lowered by 95mm. This was due to the shift from a space-first approach to a multi-passenger luxury car that offers a comfortable ride and driving experience with a comfortable cabin. The lightly wedge-shaped side windows  blacked-out pillars  split lamps in the grille  horizontal garnish at the rear and vertical tail lamps create a unique and luxurious atmosphere.   We started with the 2.5-liter model  and the result exceeded our expectations: the suspension is soft enough to provide sufficient comfort for all three rows of seats  but the ride is comfortable.    Even on rough surfaces  there is no push-up  and even when riding over gaps  the body always maintains a flat posture and does not sway later on. The ride quality is closer to that of a sedan than a minivan.   Because it is a minivan  the steering response is not quick  but the movement is very straightforward and cornering and lane changes are nimbly determined. In addition to the front and rear stabilizers  the car is equipped with dampers with rebound springs  so although the car rolls to some extent  it has a good sense of unity.   Using ECO mode definitely improves practical fuel efficiency.    The 2.5-liter engine  which has a lighter nose thanks to the four-cylinder design  has a maximum torque of 245 Nm and a flat characteristic that generates more than 210 Nm of torque between 2000 and 2500 rpm  making it very responsive no matter where you step on the gas pedal.    When accelerating at full throttle  the EXTRONIC CVT is a bit sticky and the engine noise is annoying  but when cruising at 100km/h  the RPM is around 1 700  so the clarity of conversation is the best in its class.    There is also a new ECO mode that changes the throttle and CVT control  and when this mode is turned on  the engine maintains a low rpm range of around 2000 rpm. However  this is still sufficient in terms of power performance.   When the ECO mode is turned off  the engine uses more rpm in the 3000 rpm range  and the response is even better. As you can see  the new engine has no flaws.    The 3.5-liter V6 engine  on 
3212,Translation:  >The Mexican unit of US automaker Ford will stop production on Friday in both shifts of its plant in the city of Hermosillo due to a material shortage problem  according to a document released by the company's union on Thursday.   On Monday and Tuesday  manufacturing was also suspended in this complex located in the state of Sonora  where the Bronco Sport SUV is being built and since this year also the Maverick pickup  which is exported mainly to the United States.
3213,Transparency is my default when it comes to any player rolls. Its not a matter of trust  its just ensuring everything is transparent and above-board so that there is never any question of suspicion from other players of GM alike
3214,true. every game is an rpg now just because  i guess  there's something addicting in seeing your skills gain a level  even if the actual improvement / effect on the gameplay is miniscule. personally it's annoying to me. it's also limiting as rpg's usually make you choose a specialization so you can't use any weapon or skill you feel like at the moment - you have to stick to one or just a few and improve them to get the most of them.
3215,Try [Lady Blackbird](http://www.onesevendesign.com/ladyblackbird/). Simple to understand  no prep  and also free. Its a good example of a game thats more freeform than 5e  so it should give you a way to see where your tastes lie.  Call of Cthulhu has a [free quickstart](https://www.chaosium.com/cthulhu-quickstart/) if youre willing to try a horror game. The chaotic idiot will probably end up dying in an interesting way  so just think of them as the party redshirt.  Other than that  what kind of genre  tone  level of crunch  etc. would you and your group like to try?
3216,Try going back to the previous editions of Vamp. I played it in 1st editiona nd can't ever recall any sexual overtones or anything like that. There were no extra clans either like the flesh weavers or the settites or the daughters it was just the basic survival game in a world where the werewolves didn't like you
3217,Try Jagged Alliance 2  all the stats are self explanatory and there are no classes  only traits.  Wisdom just affects the rate at which you gain better stats and all stats increase either by training or doing.
3218,Try lowering your screen brightness. All the articles about sleeping problems and gaming are probably a lot more relevant than you think. The issues pop up when you concentrate on a screen for hours on end  not necessarily because of the playing video games part.  I used to get massive headaches because I tend to spend 10+ hours non stop on my projects at times. I brought down the brightness to 20% and it took care of all my issues.
3219,Try Outward  maybe. Does have missions  and a story  but those can ignored for quite a bit while you explore and stock up on gold  weapons  items  etc. You can also pretty much explore every area at anytime after you leave the beginning town's gates  so there's nothing but skill and preparation barring you from any area of the game.  There are survival mechanics for weather  temperature  disease  and what not  so being prepared is necessary  but you also have to manage weight or you'll be over-encumbered.
3220,Try removing everything that can be removed and put it back. There's videos for how to remove ram gpu and power connectors. Also take a look if there's any leds on the motor that can tell you what's going on or beep codes. If it becomes too intimidating a lot of small local pc repair places do free diagnostic.   Edit if you take it to them and they find the issue you can just take your pc and fix it yourself if you want but remember they took time and effort and put it onto the diagnostic please offer a cash tip or just go with them for the service if it's a good price.
3221,Try the Banner Saga games. They have elements of tactical rpg  roguelike  oregon trail  and visual novel style games. Definitely great RPGs and a unique experience. Well-executed and low hardware requirements.
3222,Try to break down the program you need for the game you are trying to make into very small pieces.  Example: player chops a tree with an axe -> (Play the animation of cutting the player's tree) & (the tree object's HP is reduced) & (The tree shakes) & (If the tree's HP runs out  the tree will break)  By disassembling it in detail like this  I think that you can make many things just by doing a google search.  I wanted to break it down into smaller pieces  but I'm not going to do it because reddit seems to be complicated.  I'd like to write a cleaner example of this  but on reddit  this seems to be the limit
3223,Try Tyranny. It's an isometric RPG with grrat replay value  set in a very interesting setting rooted more in antiquity than fake Middle Ages. You play as an agent of an invading tyrannical empire  but can definitely choose how you about this  if at all.  There's a neat magic system  artifacts evolving as you use them  and cool companions. Good stuff.  It's also quite short  25-ish hours on some paths  so it doesn't overstay irs welcome.
3224,Try watching live action/western movies  And shows. I recommend the obvious ones that youve prob watched like breaking bad  better call Saul  the sopranos  the wire  Barry  and also  bojack horseman  Hannibal  ect   Maybe also try manga. Good ones include berserk  goodnight punpun  vagabond  Vinland saga  3 days of happiness
3225,TVR. Didn't see any comments yet about them. Didn't own any  heck didn't have the chance to see one irl either ... Just any time they get mentioned on the internet or on tv: they are beautiful but unreliable.  The exact opposite of a Fiat Multipla.  Edit: not worthless though  most people would be proud to own one I think.
3226,Two big lessons:  * Get an instructor for your first day. Doesn't matter how much you think you know about the track experience  an instructor will help. I've talked to some first timers who say they want to get the first day done on their own  then will consider an instructor. Baffling logic. The instructor is most important on the first day. They're included with many organizations like NASA  Hooked on Driving  Chin  etc.   * You don't need a fast car for the track. In fact  you'll improve quicker with a slow car. 318  base Civic  Dodge Neon  all perfect cars for track work.
3227,Two days ago  i started up my computer and tried to install fallout 4 and back 4 blood and i noticed my computer being incredibly slow. I check my task manager and its saying that im at 100% disk usage. Nothing is running on the hard drive and ive tried many many fixes that didnt work. Help appreciated.
3228,Two main things that 'canon' can do that make it important for me: 1) create constraints on player/character decisions in the form of verisimilitude  possibilities for character action  or norms and expectations; 2) provide a shared base of knowledge among players. Canon is only useful or important if the other players are already up to speed with it... which is pretty rare in the games I've played. For this reason  events and characters are fairly trivial; what's important are the constraints and opportunities they leave behind for players (including the GM  usually me) to use. I guess in other words: if the game system provides game rules  canon provides story rules  and it's mainly worthwhile only if players already know those rules.  That said  I'm rather curious about what questions you're exploring  or critical approach you're taking. Would like to know more  if you don't mind saying a bit about it.
3229,Two that come to mind are KUROMUKURO  ([http://www.ddmcd.com/movies/kuromukuro-1-2](http://www.ddmcd.com/movies/kuromukuro-1-2) ) and GARGANTIA ON THE VERDUROUS PLANET ([http://www.ddmcd.com/movies/gargantia-on-the-verdurous-planet.html](http://www.ddmcd.com/movies/gargantia-on-the-verdurous-planet.html)). They both combine familiar tropes in clever and entertaining ways.
3230,u/TraderJoJos  There appears to be [Some guy](https://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561199083807169/recommended/1728080/) who is angry about your game  judging by private profile and almost no games its probably him with a couple of alts  acting like a turd for no reason  followed by a bunch of people calling him out as such.  I would say abandoning the discord server instead of getting a mod or 2 was a serious mistake  but its not too late. [Someones gotta take out the trash](https://knowyourmeme.com/memes/banhammer)  letting it build up will cause serious consequences  which you have gotten probably the worst case scenario of such. Dont overuse it though  We all saw what happened with yansim.  Edit: 720 likes  nice.
3231,Um... I'd like to see absolutely none of these remade? Especially not the 3DS or GC/Wii games  the former because they don't need it and the latter because they are just cringe/lame games.  I'd like to see FE1  FE3  or FE4 remade  if any of them. FE4 would probably make the most sense.
3232,Underfox (@Underfox3) Tweeted: Patent: Face-to-face dies with enhanced power delivery using extended TSVs - Nvidia  Nvidia 3D stacked GPUs is coming...  More details: https://t.co/kirbPVtG4X https://t.co/nIN8avksZ2 https://twitter.com/Underfox3/status/1439633710039580672?s=20
3233,Underrail is a gem and should run on a toaster despite being relatively new. Also  Gothic series (which ended with the third part). I would put those games among the best RPG's there are even without considering spec requirements.
3234,Undying springs to mind - it was created to emulate the political intrigue of Vampire the Masquerade but without all the lore and with a lighter system. To be honest I think the system is way too light  but thats a matter of taste and it might suit you?  Give it a read if you have the chance.
3235,Unfortunately  I have to agree with some of the other comments. The game looks boring. And this is the kind of game that should normally get me excited. Maybe the game is actually good  but the marketing is terrible. I can only judge from that.  The description doesn't sound too good  it sounds like more work than fun. I feel like I have to do a lot  and I don't even know what the goal or reward is. Explain where the game starts and where it's going  and then explain what you will be doing the whole time  but in a more fun and exciting way.  Absolutely nothing happens in the video. It's nice to show game play  but you should show a part of the game when something actually happens. Pick one mission  for example  show how it's being done  and what the reward is. Let's say you are assigned the task of fixing that potato processor  then show how you collect the parts  put them together  fix the processor  than show how you finally have processed potatoes. (Yes I picked something stupid  don't do that.)  Also  when looking very closely  I feel like your graphics might be pretty good. But I wouldn't know that  because it's so dark. I don't see anything. I would probably fall asleep during the game. If that's just one short period of time during the game  that's fine  but don't pick that for the trailer. If the whole game is like that  well  I've got bad news. Yeah  it's atmospheric. Whatever that means. It's just not comfortable for game play.  Hope this helps  buddy :)
3236,Unfortunately now choice is near unlimited too and most do have the disposable income to try new stuff. When I was younger could maybe afford a game every few months so thats what you wer stuck with.  Now u play a RPG for a week see a new recommendation or release and now your onto that  its also the same for tv I find  a lot of programmes and games tempting and contending for your time and money.  I rarely finish a game these days dont know if its limited time to play so u lose intrest quickly or if indeed games nowadays just suck and we have seen the same formulas overused.
3237,Unfortunately youre just going to have to live your life around making it as accurate to the sticker as possible. Might be tough on the kids if youve got the wrong number of em or theyre the wrong gender  but theyll be happier than your cat thats for sure. Sorry.
3238,"Unity is good for AR (I'm working on a big AR project in Unity at work)  but:  1. The last time I've checked AR Foundation doesn't support Web XR. I.e. if you want a web app  you have to go to a different solution or wait until it's implemented. Maybe wait for a very long time.  2. AR Foundation will require you to understand quite complex programming patterns. Even to make something relatively simple  like detect a trackable image.  3. There is Unity MARS that allows ""to do AR"" without programming. BUT  first it's desperately lagging behind AR Foundation in features (i.e. even a longer wait for Web XR  minus Depth API and some other features); second it's a very complicated and inconvenient thing (you can do something simple in a few clicks  but as soon as you do something non-standard  you get into hell); and third it's absurdly expensive for open beta test."
3239,Unless they tell you exactly what the minimum octane rating is then use premium. Saying premium recommended does not at all imply regular is okay. A car could be premium recommended but require mid grade.
3240,"Unpopular opinion incoming!  I'm all for games to have as much options available to the players as possible.  This however I feel like is being blown way out of proportion  judging from this thread  most people who'll play solo are not ""hardcore"" gamers or people with a lot of time to play  so why do you care if there's no progression or achievements in solo mode?  This game is obviously being made with a specific target audience in mind  just like every other game nowadays  these types of complaints are eerily similar to the ""put an easy mode in dark souls"" argument  they could put an easy mode in the game  but that's not the point of Dark Souls  just like I feel that playing B4B solo is not what the devs intended for.  I know they re doing this to sell cosmetics as well  but that doesn t invalidate my point."
3241,Until now every episode managed to give me goosebumbs  this one especially.  Finally seeing the Reginleif in action and Shin playing with Fido were definitely the highlight of this episode for me. Also Eugene  seeing him die a second time really hurt more than expected..
3242,Urban Shadows has similiar vibes but only some pf the characters ate vampires. Most of the politics comes from bridging the factions between creatures of the night  outsiders  magic users  and regular humans
3243,"US perspective  while we have great DC charger coverage already with [Electrify America](https://www.electrifyamerica.com/locate-charger/)  it's frankly ridiculous that this is still a work in progress.  EA has a 2 billion dollar budget that is supposed to last 10+ years. They've done all that with a fraction of the 2 billion.  The main criticism I hear of EVs is ""but what if I want to go to X?"" not even the charge speed any more  from those that know about the latest models. This is an easily solvable problem and in my view will spur on a lot more growth in EV sales."
3244,USB 4 is a tunneling protocol in Thunderbolt 4  Thunderbolt 3&4 both have a direct line to the CPU.  That is  the thunderbolt card plugs into a PCIe but has a cable to the Thunderbolt header  which has a direct line to the CPU.  Interesting Fact: some high end motherboards have 2 thunderbolt headers on the motherboard.
3245,USB-C for powering devices is the dumbest fucken idea the computer industry has come up with in a long time.  These connectors are not meant for that kind of abuse.  Every time I click in the stupid connector into my laptop it feels like it's going to snap off.
3246,Use DuckStation through Retroarch. Dont pay a fee for this  please.   DuckStation is both accurate and will upscale the game and fix wobbly polygons to a degree you couldnt really even imagine. It will play like you remember it  or even better.   DuckStation is relatively new-ish. Most people that recommend emulators or cores that arent DuckStation likely havent tried DuckStation. Its simply the best way to play 99 percent of the PS1 classics.
3247,Use what they do IRL and use their tricks without the marketing face:  - Convince them that they really need a college degree so they have to accept huge loans and become indebted for their whole lives.
3248,"Using dice to roll statistics is so AD&D from the 80's.  It is just plain bad because it creates characters that aren't fun because they either suck at what they do or just plain die easily.  While there is the meme about housecats killing Mages  a badly rolled Fighter can die to the same kitten. With the possible  if ""WTF?!""  rolls  a cat can TPK the party."
3249,Usually jack of all trades or power armor type characters.  Examples: Final Fantasy 6 where you can heal  use magic  attack with weapons to varying degrees of effectiveness  blue magic  Edgar's Tools and so on. Recently Shionne from Tales of Arise with gun  healing magic  grenades  status inducing effects. Then my personal favorite the dragoons from Legend of Dragoon with their magical power armor enhancing them  giving them magical abilities and flight.
3250,Valkyrie Profile. Game excels at everything: Combat  voice work  character animation. The story is great also.   The real flaw in the game is the steps required to get the canon ending is esoteric and niche. It required either a walkthrough or accidentally stumbling upon the solution.   If there is going to be a modern remake  and there will be because Lenneth Valkyrie was Tri-Ace's mascot for a time  they could make the A ending more accessible and easier to get to. I won't be playing it because I hate Lenneth Valkyrie as a character.
3251,Vampire the Masquerade: Bloodlines  Kind of captures the spirit of the original Deus Ex. While a linear game on the whole there are meaningful choices and every mission has many viable ways to succeed. Combat is inevitable but stealth and diplomacy are extremely viable.
3252,Vampire the Masquerade: Bloodlines offers a huge amount of freedom when addressing quests  primarily in the early game. The late game does become combat heavy  although theres still moments of semi-notable freedom  like the Giovanni Mansion (and the Clan Quest mod to offer more)
3253,"Vampire: The Masquerade - Bloodlines - amazing on all fronts. Just make sure to use the patch.  Disco Elysium - masterful storyline  amazing characters and setting. No combat  though.  Planescape: Torment - possibly the greatest CRPG ever made. There is a clear best way to build your character  though; I really recommend using a guide when going through character creation.  Fallout 1  2 and New Vegas - I recommend playing them in this order and forgetting Bethesda's entries exist.  Gothic 1 and 2 - SUPER janky  but there's nothing quite like these out there. Gothic 1's setting is absolutely delicious.  Deus Ex - this is THE immersive sim. It's almost depressing to see how dumbed down modern atrempts at this kind of game are.  Baldur's Gate 1 & 2 - you can skip 1 if you want  but I recommend playing both.  Arx Fatalis - Arkane's masterpiece. A pity they don't make games like this any more.  Ultima Underworld - if Deus Ex is THE immersive sim  UU is the pioneer. It is also the best old ""3D"" first-person game.  If you enjoy blobbers  Wizardry 8 and Might and Magic VI should please you immensely  given how exploration-heavy they are.  The Elder Scrolls 3: Morrowind - breaking this game apart is delightful  and pretty much expected by its design. It also has one of the best settings in the history of video games. The combat sucks  though.  Arcanum - highly unpolished and with lots of issues  like all games made by Troika (VTMB was also made by them)  but still amazing. This is the definition of a diamond in the rough.  Age of Decadence - character creation is THE most important thing you do in this game."
3254,Vaporware.  Can we stop giving publicity to companies who lie about shit like this? It's bad enough with Tesla at least having a half ass glorified cruise control  but it's ridiculous with companies not producing anything but blog material.
3255,Variable-speed fans generally run at full power when their controllers are offline.  If your fans are plugged right into the motherboard  that would mean that the board is failing to POST when you power it on.    You say someone messed with your BIOS; do you have any information about what might have been done to it?
3256,Very few games need a remake  though several could use a remaster. I don't think FF7 needed the remake it's getting (don't get me wrong  I love it so far)  but only needed new graphics.  But I'd say pretty much everything from the 2D turn based genre should be left alone. Lufia  Chrono Trigger  Earthbound  and Lunar SSS those games simply don't need anything else.
3257,Very interesting read.  Looks like Zhaoxin made the cores smaller in order to fit eight of them into a single CPU. A rather bad move - you'd be much better off with four high-performance cores than eight weak cores.
3258,Very nice episode. Really a fan of the animation  invokes a sense of the original Lupin animation  while mordernizing it and making it very smooth.   Also  the 2021 version of the OP is great. ED is also good.
3259,Very old school and linear but the 90s animation holds up: the broken sword games are fun. I recommend 1 and 2. I think I heard 3 and 4 were not great but they did an update a few years ago with 5 and its super fun and even funny! Very 90s but you might like.
3260,Very strong first episode that does a great job at setting expectations high and shows the potential of the Part.   What I liked: The character design of the gang is beautiful  Holmes  Lily and Lestrade are preety likeable  Lupin has a great balance between serious and goofy  The chase scenes were really fun  The opening was incredible  Unlike Part 5 the setting actually has importance  The plot seems really interesting and I love that Holmes and (surprisingly) Lily seem to have a past with Lupin.   What I disliked: The excessive use of CGI on the cars  The bike chase was a bit uneventful with Lupin and Fujiko mostly just driving around  The ending theme is sweet but the ending overall doesn't reach the heights of Parts 4 and especially 5.
3261,Very worrying to hear that even a 2500$ product can't be properly QC'ed...  I'm holding off on upgrading my monitor (it has no ergonomic support) and it seems like the monitor market is a minefield these days. I want something to last 4-5 years minimum  not something I'll regret buying after less than a year.
3262,Viable for what? Will it run? Volvos and Audis and even ford have used 5 cylinder engines before. All of which are know be fast cars for the most part. A newer RS3 can put out 500+hp from a stock 5 pot. Old focus ST/RS also known to make decent power. Good handling as well on those cars
3263,VtM got the GURPS treatment for different mechanics. You could also take a look at the UK TV Show Ultraviolet  if you're not already familiar with it. You could also just put your own spin on WOD VtM to suit your needs.
3264,VtmB is not that retro  definetely not like System Shock 2 or Deus Ex 1. It's not much more complex than New Vegas  probably less even. There's like 10 weapons for melee\\ranged respectively  only 4 armor pieces  all of which are direct upgrades  skills are very straightforward and skillchecks are not steep.     It is absolutely worth it if you enjoy a good story and VERY well written dialogue and characters and it's probably the best vampire-themed experience in videogames period.
3265,VTT is absolutely possible. Another option - look for local meet up groups and the like. Though understandably - this last year and a half hasn't been the best in terms of socializing  especially if you are one of those (like myself) who already struggle with getting to know new people and connect.
3266,W221 and W222s still look very classy and stately. I think that they will start looking like old cars for a few years and then people will realize how nice their designs were. This seems to be the way it goes with the big body Benzes. The W126 came back into fashion 10-15 years or so ago. The W140 is appreciated now - especially when its on a nice set of Monoblock wheels! W220s (especially V12 or AMG cars) are finally starting to get the respect that they deserve  although they were probably the worst built S-Class.
3267,W3 is awesome  I sure wanted it to be more akin to the previous games (more of an rpg) but it's such a fun journey you won't regret loosing yourself within that world for the 100 hours it takes on average to complete it.  Heart of Stone is probably the strongest part of the game  incredible writing  best characters. Blood and Wine is a great finish to the saga  even Sapkowski should be proud.
3268,Wait a second  didnt Ford develop a car made out of soybean plastic in the late 30s or so?  I seem to remember a pic of Henry Ford whacking the trunklid of the car with a mallet to show that it didnt easily dent.
3269,Wait a while  does she continue to roll suspiciously well during playtime  or does she roll a bit average?  Does this actually become a long term problem or does it fade into nothingness?  I am famous for every single game I play my dice rolls are crap  we kept score a few times and i always roll below average.  So okay i cheat and make my character a bit better than she should be or else I am honestly dead weight as I never succeed at a single hit  well i suppose I do provide most of the slapstick comedy moments as I fail every jump and miss every shot.   I really do give those opponents a good view of my sword i stand there and show them every inch of it and tiny detail.  So other than worrying about her kit and stats wait to she how she plays.
3270,"Wait til you get to the truly difficult parts. The ones that have no objective answers. All the ""design"" parts. Game design. Level design. Scope. Oof.  Scripting the game and making assets is the easiest part."
3271,"Warp into the Code Geass world kill Lelpuch lamperouge in ep 3 so he hasn't figured out his powers yet.   Go to Goku and look at him and say ""I order you to DIE ""  Mission accomplished  If he somehow resist the Geass then go to one punch man world and kill Stamina with Geass then kill Goku with ONE PUNCH."
3272,warranty is kind of like insurance except in this case the manufacturer has to approve the work so the dealership gets paid. at least how i understand it.     It's most likely the manufacturer saying they won't pay. Same for the issue replication  i'm thinking they don't want to pay for a half dozen part replacements and if no one can replicate they won't pay for anything  &#x200B;  I just worked an IT permissions issue where it took me a few hours to figure out how to replicate it and a solution was impossible without replicating the issue
3273,Was pacing faster this episode  or was this just how it was in the LN? Last episode the characters set off to join the academy  and in this episode  they trained  graduated  got their new mechs designed and built  Fido came back  then Shin ranked up to Lieutenant and became a teacher  and Eugene was killed off.  It was really well directed  but it definitely felt like it was going over a lot of different things very quickly.
3274,Was really hoping the 3 undead parental figures would stick around but from the looks of it next episode seems to be the last we'll see of them after the coming of age cermony.  After what Gus pulled plus him telling Will to pretend to lose to Blood is just... I really hope nothing bad happens even that lighthearted gambling scene that ended with Mary scolding the 3 of them together didn't help to shake that really uncomfortable feeling I'm having.
3275,Wasn't easy but after a recently rebuilt engine tossed a rod at 1600 rpm and the shop wouldn't do shit despite the warranty and it never having been past 6500 rpm (was supposedly built to take 7500 rpm) and it really needed the front drums converted to disc and the rear brake lines replaced  just couldn't really afford to keep my Chevelle. I did get more than I paid for it but it's been 35 years and I still occasionally have dreams about having it back.   Did replace it with a '77 Cutlass I eventually swapped a 455 into.
3276,"Wasn't very impressed with Outter Worlds and saying it has ""swimming  multiple play-styles  two-handed weapons and magic"" doesn't inspire much confidence.  Pillars 1 and especially 2 were fantastic RPGs though so I won't count it out."
3277,"Wasteland 2 and Kingdom Come : Deliverance will scratch your itch  if you are willing to forego the ""choice consequence"" requirement there are some extraordinary indie games you should try  like Stoneshard and Underrail."
3278,Wasteland 3 maybe ? Its post apocalyptic and made by some of the people who made the original Fallouts. Its a different plays style than the newer fallouts but its definitely a fun game to sink some time in to.
3279,Watabou has a great  free-to-use random mansion generator at https://watabou.itch.io/procgen-mansion. Youll get a rotating 3-D view at first  but there is a plan view  as well as a blueprint view  that will give you what youre after.
3280,Watch some videos on Grim Dawn or Last Epoch to see if those work for you. Both highly customizable character build games.  GD has a modding community which makes customization 10000x crazier with options
3281,watched TopGear as a kid and talked about it with my friends even if we didn't understand much about it.    I dont read much about cars but I enjoy some blogs  eg. Drivertical - very easy to read and provides interesting thoughts as Automotive blog too.
3282,We are currently at closed beta testing.  If you want to participate join our Discord channel.

3283,We could not have reached this goal without our awesome fans! Thank you from the Resident Evil family.   ***  posted by [@dev1_official](https://twitter.com/dev1_official)  Photos in tweet |  [Photo 1](http://pbs.twimg.com/media/FBJnMCEUUAAXKw6.jpg)   ^[(Github)](https://github.com/username) ^| ^[(What'snew)](https://github.com/username)
3284,We didn't see such severe impacts in our gaming tests  with our biggest Windows 10 vs 11 differences weighing in at 7% in one game title  while others are far more muted.  Clickbait. Real world effects are not much at all  this only really shows up in benchmarks. They will patch it so all of your benchmarks that you all spend running all day long look fine again meanwhile the rest of us will continue to actually USE our PCs for what we bought them for.
3285,"We keep switching up games every time a campaign dies instead of staying with the same ones  but mostly that's because our picks have been... not great  or not gelled well with the GM. I'd like to return to systems we've already done sometime but so far it isn't working out so hot.  Guess that's what happens when ""try new and relatively unplayed things"" is on the menu."
3286,We really need to take this next step away from past-gen systems. Every generations early days gets muddled by games held back by dates hardware  and every generation it gets worse. Lets not forget how awfully fragmented Call of Duty got between the 360 and One.  I understand its been hard to get a hold of new systems  and it makes sense to keep supporting the old ones for now  but if were talking about a game that doesnt even have a release window a year after the launch of the new systems  I dont think we should be upset or surprised that its not being developed on the PS4 and Xbox One.
3287,We recorded a short actual play video to better showcase features of [Them Deeper Bones](https://themdeeperbones.com) basic combat mechanics like declare-first initiative and damage rolls (banked dice and all)  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=580bQhI2Wqs
3288,We rotate GMing and pretty much every switch is a new system.  Pathfinder  Blades in the Dark  Exalted  SLA Industries  and onward.  Players opt out as they wish and come back 6-24 months later when we switch again.
3289,We see that Will grew a bit more since last episode  continues his lessons with 3 undead  takes on Blood's challenge of escaping from catacombs where now lurk mindless skeletons. He doesn't seem to have much trouble with regular skeletons  but then he finds skeleton of Vraskus (demon) and decides to take him on as well. Of course Will finds him not stronger than Blood  but that skeleton can use magic and pretty resilient so Will broke his sword of it (it was enough to destroy skeleton as well  but still  Will lost his weapon). At least skeleton was kind enough to leave dwarven magic spear for Will to use. Sometime later he finds Gus who summons golem and attacks our hero. Will tries to kill Gus but can't. Thankfully it all was just a lesson  so fight stops. Will thinks there is more to it tho and he probably right. Anyway  spear Will found is indeed lit  can change shape  it's magical weapon  looks cool  suited weapon for a protagonist. After some dungeon crawling and looting of the dungeon and coin collecting Gus teaches Will to... gamble? Yep  he sure does. Mary wasn't happy about it  of course. But whatever  soon comes the day of Will's 15th birthday  which means he'll become the adult and Gus says that Blood might want to Duel with Will and actually asks for him to try to lose in the way that won't be obvious. Why? He's definitely has something on his mind and I'm interested. Although I have a feeling that Will would have to kill all 3 of the undead at some point for whatever reason. Kind of hoping I'm wrong cause I like Blood  Mary and Gus  but we'll see. Interesting episode and this show definitely shapes up as one of the best ones this season (that already filled with quality).
3290,We will be interviewing current Starfinder dev Jason Tondro and former/original Starfinder senior dev Owen KC Stephens about the unionization effort at 6pm MT on the BAMF podcast https://youtu.be/7Dw\_VZ5nRCU
3291,Wear your seatbelt. And I'm sure you don't mind having your 15 or 20 year old cars stolen  but 99.9% of people would opt in to have their new $30k car have a chipped key so someone can't just walk up with lockpicks or a simple tool and take their car in under a minute
3292,Weatherworn: [https://store.steampowered.com/app/1486180/Weatherworn\_The\_Adventure\_of\_Pap\_\_Pup/?beta=1](https://store.steampowered.com/app/1486180/Weatherworn_The_Adventure_of_Pap__Pup/?beta=1)  TheGamer previewed it here: [https://www.thegamer.com/weatherworn-preview/](https://www.thegamer.com/weatherworn-preview/)
3293,Web-based game? The web is a unique platformit is a bit of a beast  compared to other platforms. I recommend that if you are developing a game that you want to run in the web browser that you have the game running in the web browser starting **day one.**  Doing a later port to the web is  of course  possible. However  it may be a pain in the ass. If youre not developing for the web  there may be assumptions built into your game that have to be completely revisited when you run in the web browser  or decisions that you regret. Sometimes you can just throw Emscripten at your problem and get something reasonable but its just much better to start with the web if you want your game to run on the web.  Something that is more important on the web is file size. This is because each time someone plays your gam  they may have to download the entire game before they can start playingso the larger a game is  the longer it takes to start a new game. For a lightweight game where you don't need some all of the bells and whistles of UE4  you should stick with something bare-bones  like **SDL.** SDL works in Emscripten fairly well  so you can use it for a web game without blowing up your file sizes. SFML  I think  uses an SDL backend on the web.  The obvious alternative to C++ & SDL (+ Emscripten) is to make the game using a JavaScript framework  like Phaser or PIXI.js. This may be a lot simpler for you to get running.  You will also need a server-side component for multiplayer. Because it's the web  this means websockets. Recommended that you use a more typical language for server development  like Java  Go  or C# these are all good choices. Theyre safer than C++ (you should **not** be writing your web server in C++ unless you know what youre doing)  easy to use  and have excellent performance.
3294,Wedev and gamedev can both be as easy or as hard as you make them.   Web development might mean tweaking a WordPress css file and calling it a day. Or  it might mean writing an application like google docs with real time synchronization  a custom layout engine  and massive clusters of k8s pods coordinating everything from the backend.   Game development can mean writing a visual novel in RenPy  but it can also mean writing a deferred rendering engine  rollback netcode  and finding a way to make a fun game when you have 1000 developers all pulling in different directions.  The best practical advise I can give is - front end web development is often cradled in a mess of abstractions  which hide the inner working of the computer from you. Make sure you have a good understanding of what a computer really does  and not just the abstractions browsers present to you. It'll pay dividends immediately with game development  but it'll make you a better web developer too.
3295,Weirdly enough  cabin air filter  typing the car model in my country's online shops that sell parts often brings out the slightly bigger one that doesn't really fit that well (can be jammed in if needed but it's not great)

3301,"Well  first of all  let me begin  1. Even thought I don't like filler episodes  The fillers from Inuyasha do A better Job at Development Character's motivation (that Episode that Jaken got poisoned and Rin had to go and fetch some medicine is a good example of that... and the only one that I have i'm over the half of the series and I already forgot the other half  goddabit) 2. Currently (2017 - 2021)  the art that comes from Manga currently there isn't a little bit of.... there is no ""original artwork""  I just feel that  when It comes to each mangaka (at least currently)  they don't try to drawn on the mangaka's own art style  * Example: Look at Tokyo's Revenger's art style and Compare to Jujutsu no Kaizen's  it looks similar... a lot similar  no? * Now  if we go back to the 80s  90s and 2000s; this isn't a problem. Look at the ""GTO"" Great Teacher Onizuka's artstyle and compare to... Inuyasha's-- Or better: Compare Deadman Wonderland art-style to Soul Eater's (yes  i'm using a monthly manga to compare with a weekly  give a break)  1. (3.) There is no problem with Over the top ecchi  as long as:  * The scene happens before or after something important  just because of Humor or - in a very specific and rare occasion - it has motives Inside of the story * And while I'm talking about this here it goes another thing: * Why are so many people saying ""I hate ecchi scenes... in a Shonen""  I mean... it is ok to say that  But a Shonen is boy's maganize soooo it's kinda logic that... it would have some ecchi-- I mean  if people are saying that  is because it isn't realistic  but... when you.... create some story about Pirates and Fishman when one of those two aren't real... why give a Woman big breast and say that it isn't realistic when Fishmen aren't either...? (And yes  I'm using One piece as a reference here) * (extra) Before anything  what I said above wasn't ""women shouldn't say nothing because is for boys  not girls!"" all i'm saying is: Ignore the proportions/ecchi if you don't like  the story is the main point of basically any manga. If there is a ecchi scene just skip  you... wouldn't lose something (unless that the anime is Great Teacher Onizuka  You'll lose something on this one)  1. ~~(4.) Also  when there is mangas that have their own art  or they are Overcharged (jojo's part 8 - or any other part without having a physical volume is hard to follow - and Hunters Guild: Red Hood) or they are extremly simple (Noragami) but good enough... And the we Have One Punch man art~~ (I'm ommiting this part  if you want to call this a ""I had stroke moment"" is up to you) 2. (5.) By the way  Jujutsu no kaizen is a 6/10 in my book - I'm reading the manga for reference - (nuke explode)  * Also  the good part of having a More simple art is... it's easier to follow  but it's better that everyone have their own way and not something more ""Uniform"" so to speak-- for me it's ok to sacrifice readilibity for that  &#x200B;  ...By the way  if any part of this post feels"
3302,Well  fuck. They got higher budget  giving us even more gruesome visuals to match what I read in the novel. Maybe even more.   Also  Frederica had the bad luck to know Eugene earlier before combat  hence  she also knew the moment he's passing away thanks to her esper ability.
3303,Well  if you need a way to ease yourself into it  without putting yourself too far out there  you could try out Play-by-Post.  It's a text-based medium for asychronous play.  I know of a few people who had such crippling social anxiety that managed to build up some confidence by doing PbP at first.  It's not a cure-all  of course  but it might help.  If you're interested  I recommend [Myth-Weavers.com](https://Myth-Weavers.com)  [GamersPlane.com](https://GamersPlane.com)  and/or r/pbp.
3304,Well  it's my first experience on gamedev. Last three months I worked in my game project (a city builder 2d  very inspired in classics city builder) and now  I think the barebone of gameplay is done and the first prototype playable is running.   So  I notice the addict of increase  increase and increase the game scope  but  my question is. How break this endless loop and measure if your game has a suitable amount of features that make the game minimaly fun to play? How you do this in your releases?
3305,Well  looks like you beat me with radiant historia  so here is the rest of my list.  Jrpgs -7th dragon: code VFD:  Pretty much etrian oddysey  but every class has an interesting gimmick going for it (Using playing cards as mana  being able to attack five times in a turn  having ammunition  that sort of thing). -Octopath traveler: If you liked SMT's press turn system  you'll probably like the break system the game has going for it. -Yakuza: Like a dragon / Yakuza 7: I'll be honest  mechanically  the combat is pretty much dragon quest with a few bells and whistles  its fun as hell but not really deep. Otherwise  there is a lot of different stuff to do  ranging from basic minigames such as bowling  to a full blown business management minigame.  Turnbased Games -Star Renegades: a turnbased rogue-like with some of my favourite ever combat. Its fun as hell  sadly  there isn't much else to it than fighting. -Siralim (any number):  A monster collector that focuses on making the most gamebreaking stuff you can fathom.  -Divinity: original sin 2: An isometric RPG that puts a big focus on enviromental interactions (cast rain and electrify the puddle to stun an enemy  slick someone with oil and light them up  throw crates  fill up a backpack with a 10000 kilos worth of stuff and use it to oneshot bosses  that sort of stuff). One of my all time favourites.
3306,Well  so far I have made two games and one customizable game engine  all in C++ using standard library  WinAPI & DirectX (all singleplayer). Most of my projects are web application development tho (I also worked as a web developer in a company).   I don't know if I can rightfully call myself a game dev. I fear that in order to do so  you need a decent knowledge in one of the popular engines like Unity or UE and at least released a decent game (or better some more) on Steam or other platforms. I am planning on learning UE after finishing the first version of my current game project.   I really love game development and gaming in general. I was fascinated by games since almost two decades  but started with my first game 3 years ago.   I am mostly a programmer  I am not really into graphics creation or sound creation  so I rely mostly on free assets. But I really love the programming part.   If it helps: My games are mostly top down shooter games which I really like very much and they are also extendable via scripting. Also my game engine can be used to code own games of that kind.  I also created a software that I used to create a gaming web platform where people can find other casual players (not for instant matches  but rather to find likeminded gamer friends (no dating)).  When would you call someone  or yourself  a game developer / game programmer? What criteria do you apply to the term?
3307,Well  that explains why when I get home and take my laptop out of my backpack sometimes it will be warm and have its battery drained  I like being able to instantly wake my laptop when I open the lid since it's really convenient for class and quickly studying between classes  but having the feature drain my battery to the point where it shuts down to protect it is as far from ideal as you can get
3308,Well  there are loads of games in tactics genre. If you are willing to dip into the west  x-com enemy unknown is a good intro which does not overwhelm you with options. If you want a more Japanese themed game  maybe try fell seal arbiters mark? It's not too difficult  plus you can always grind your way to victory in those titles.
3309,Well  this is the beta so they should obviously change the zombie audio and take that noise out. Still  it is pretty obvious just some kind of growling zombie noise. Wouldnt make sense to just randomly drop racism in your game
3310,Well D&D was all I played for about 15 years then we got tempted by the greater character detail and skill-based vocations of Dangerous Journeys.  That soon got Homebrew'd and we brought some aspects of D&D into it as we didn't want to leave the Forgotten Realms.  D&D then just got more complex with its classes and feats and dozens of rulebooks and class supliments so we stayed away.  Eventually time constraints and 2020 set us looking for a fun simple system that still fed our love of swords and sorcery  again D&D was too complex and slow  and that's when we discovered the awesome Tunnels & Trolls  which is where we are now.  T&T is much more about the roleplay than the stats.
3311,"Well deserved recognition to one of the stronger CEOs in today's fast moving world of technology.  I feel like Rory Read deserves some amount of recognition for slicing / dicing AMD down to a smaller size and surviving through 2014. But it was Lisa Su's execution that took AMD from Zen1 through Zen3  and from GCN into RDNA.  Rory Read setup the conditions necessary for Zen1 (by cutting back on Bobcat  slicing down AMD's engineering / marketing departments  and **surviving** AMD's near bankruptcy). He gets a bad rap because AMD lost the most money during his tenure  but... looking back on it... Rory Read did a good job. Even then  Rory Read left AMD before Zen was complete: Lisa Su took over partway through development. So she still gets partial-credit for Zen's architecture IMO.  Before her position as CEO  Lisa Su was working in AMD. Allegedly she was one of the main reasons why the PS4 / XBox One uses AMD chips. So she was doing clearly good work even when she was ""just"" a vice president at the company.  Even as I feel like Rory Reid deserves a lot of the credit for AMD's biggest technical achievement (ie: the AMD Zen core)  Lisa Su still deserves credit for the forward looking thinking that AMD has positioned itself as today. This includes the wins of multiple supercomputer projects (Frontier and El Capitan)  the development from Zen through Zen3 (and the future: such as those 3d SRAM stacks for L3 cache coming out soon)  the PS5 and XBox Series X wins and more."
3312,Well I was born this way. :D  Even when I was very small it was already all about the toy cars and growing the collection.   Then when I was about 12  my then best friend's grandfather passed away  and left his Trabant 601 parked in their garden. One day  we bad kids decided to have a ride in it. We had to fight for it  it didn't start  we actually managed to even clean the carburetor which was clogged preventing it to run (how did we know that was the issue - we were already riding two old motorbikes with carburated engines... mechanic stuff came quite early to me)  and apart from each of us stalling a few times  we absolutely thrashed it along the rural abandoned roads and fields. Of course we got noticed and been told off quite harshly apart from my father who just laughed at us (he's into cars too  he knew exactly what it was)  the key to the Trabant got locked away forever  but that one ride was enough to make me want another one every day until I could drive legally  even though the Trabant is quite a shitbox  it was amazing... well  to be honest I did drive quite a lot before I got my license. I just couldn't help the urge  and I consider myself super lucky to have never been caught with that.  That Trabant is now in my garden by the way  still in a sorry condition (after our stunt it just sat there for about 15 years)  but have plans to restore it when my other money pits allow me time to do it. Would make a nice oldtimer  the Germans love them nowadays.
3313,Well I'm now on my 8th S2000...   I bought this one in 2018 after an 8 hour drive to Disney where the guy met me nearby at his mother's house. Guy was in his 50's and just bought a 981 GT4. His mother was the original owner and he was the second. Full maintenance records dating back to the PDI when delivered.  OEM hardtop VIN matched  two sets of wheels  all car covers  all Original literature  and the OEM US hardtop stand.  $15k out the door for a 60k mile clean title 9/10 VIN S2000 with the plastic on the original soft top glass. Today it's got 95k  some modifications and would sell for about double that...  My dad wanted a 4Runner that was easier to park and manual so we got him a FJ Cruiser. $10k with 70k miles AWD and TRD wheels. Now it's worth twice that with twice the miles however he won't sell it.  My Grandpa? He bought a cheap GMC Truck that was turned in for Cash4Clunkers. It's a GMC Syclone black on black.    It's weird...
3314,Well it is Mugen Train recut so of course its awesome. Giving it a full length arc isnt that far from movie length  but I am looking forward to seeing if they add anything major. Theres a couple of new moments like Rengokus first IMAI sending shockwaves and new shots spliced in.   The next couple episodes should cover my favorite part of the movie which are the dream sequences. Tanjiros ia particularly emotional  but Inosukes is hilarious. I wonder how theyre going to pace this out. Especially the final battles.
3315,Well someone already mentioned Greedfall which is a great game and check all your boxes. I would throw out a game called Outward  it's an RPG / Dark Souls like survival game. Though a bit grindy and a bit harsh of a game. It's a real survival game that has a legitimate story and quality RPG elements.
3316,Well well  i certainly didn't expect them to cover this much  (also think they kinda changed the order of the events ).  And also didn't expect to show more about Marcel. I liked how they portrayed Eugene's death though it was more painful in LN imo  but more brutal in anime. Poor guy his lower half was blowed up.  Since this episode had anime original scene and covered different parts of LN there wasn't any worthable changes  except maybe an inner monologue. So maybe i should add some additiona detailes in source material corner.
3317,"Well what's causing you to  ""lose enthusiasm few sessions in""?   That seems like the only issue.  Can't you just run the current system campaign (maybe a short mini-campaign) in an interesting way?   Are you running canned campaigns for these systems? Or your own material?"
3318,Well. I wasn't too attached to that specific character... And I generally give the best loot to my character  so as a consequence they can carry the team during these disruptions...  But I guess it doesn't bother me that much.
3319,Well... I love worldbuilding  but fantasy isn't a real literary niche in my country  so I started GMing. The other thing that pushed me to GM was that I played on a 4e DnD group  and the DM kept using 3.5 rules. The group disbanded when we all went to Uni  but I started joining 5e groups and in most of them the DMs were also using 3.5/Homebrew 3.5 rules and that pissed me off  so I started GMing to follow the rules  use homebrews that I liked  run different systems other than DnD and some local 3.5 based systems and  the most important  to keep creativity flowing
3320,Went back to Outward after a couple of years break  didn't realize they updated a few of the things that made me shelf it in the first place (the map  the backback  and the performance). Playing on Series X feels more like it was intended.
3321,We've talked about this on our Podcast quite a few times. The best way to end up owning lots of things and have lots of experiences is to enjoy the adventures with each car (lots of pictures  lots of memories) and then move on when time or needs require it.  It's difficult  especially at first  but it gets easier. Unless you have the space and $ to never let one go  it's a reality. But holding on for nostalgia can prevent new and interesting car experiences.  Document and revel it the time you've had this car. And know that you can always come back around later in life if you want one again.
3322,What a bad decision not allowing players to make progress or earn achievements in solo play. When I tried playing with random groups  back during the beta  it was toxic. The players were unfriendly  disrespectful  and killjoys. I shouldn't have to wait until all of my friends are available to play the game in a enjoyable environment.      If this was just a tease of what's to come from actual release I worry for the game's longevity. I wouldn't be surprised if it plays out like Evolve all over again  after all this is the same studio.     Thankfully the game is available on the Xbox Game Pass  so I don't have to worry about buyer's remorse if my gut feeling is true. I want to have hope for the game's success  but I have been burned too many times to not have developed a cynicism outlook.
3323,What a joke.  Thanks for sharing  I just realized his happened a few times to my sister's laptop (not XPS but a Dell Inspiron): she would leave it in standby in a bag and when she'd pick it up  it was hot to the touch and had completely shut down.  How did they possibly think this was a good idea to implement standby like this.
3324,What an absolute banger of an episode  Rudeus dying inside in that prison cell was fkin hilarious. Geese is a bro.   Animation went nuts in the second half.  I can't believe Sauros died like that  what a terrible way to go out as a scapegoat. I dread the day when Eris gets these news.
3325,What an episode...  Yay!!! So happy to see Fido back alive and happy again to be back with Shin and the squad. I'm glad the Federacy atleast made an 86 memorial and put the names of their fallen comrades  a big contrast of how the Republic sees them as nothing more than nameless cannon fodders... Shin and the rest appreciates the gesture...  The Reaper is back on the job...and it had to be his first friend in the Federacy that we see that he had to put down... Damnit Eugene (RIP) and poor Nina  her only family left is gone now...That scene was so abrupt  but expected at the same time  considering what kind of story this is...  Damn..what a whiplash...
3326,What an explosive return  I love everything about this season already  my Fall 2021 highlight for sure. Lupin in London is a perfect fit and I can't wait for more interactions with Sherlock.  Also  the art style is amazing and so is the new version of the series' opening theme - this franchise still keeps on getting better and better.
3327,What are you struggling with specifically? Maybe youre still biting off more than you can chew? Its like if someone jumped into web development  depending on what they get into it could very easily end up being overwhelming for them (as theres potentially so many different things you need to know). Either field can be incredibly complex  its all dependent on ones current experience and what theyre attempting to do. But as long as youre enjoying it then keep at it  youll get better over time.
3328,What convinced me to take the plunge is that that is how I do everything in my life.  Be incredibly anxious-> do it anyway-> grow my comfort zone  become less anxious about it and grow as a person.  If you develop a habit of forcing yourself to engage with the things that make you unreasonably anxious  you will soon find yourself with a longer and longer list of things that USED to make you anxious. Forcing yourself outside of your comfort zone will cause you to adapt and expand your comfort zone to include this new thing.  This habit had me DMing very soon after I decided I wanted to try D&D with my friends  even though I was very anxious over it.
3329,What do you mean by infinite?:  * Do you mean that you want all skills and attributes to be able to increase forever? * Are you looking for skill point cost formulae so that further gains become harder as the character progresses? * Are you thinking about what the progression of open-ended skill levels means in terms of contested rolls and so forth?  How are you taking D&D 5e as the donor system from which to start?:  * Are you just borrowing the list of abilities and skills? * On the surface of it  it doesn't seem like the best donor system for you  as its entire premise is based on limited progression by levels within classes; it really is the opposite of an open-ended skill based system  More info please!
3330,What do you want out of the system?   Like  what does a generic fantasy RPG not do that you need or does that you dont want?   Are you looking more for setting  or for a system?  Edit: Not to suggest you shouldnt use a different system than generic fantasy  but I want detailed social mechanics might not give the same recommendations as I want rules for avoiding official attention to espionage antics or whatever else youre looking for.
3331,What exactly is the code? If it's effectiveness then no chems are going to revive it  could be water in the cat or even a collapsed matrix. Best to try and diagnose first what is going on in the cat before throwing chems into the mix.
3332,"What exactly SHOULD a rep say when asked 'what's the difference between Intel and AMD""?  For the vast majority of people  unless there's some whacky pricing going on ... They're pretty interchangeable  no? Maybe iGPU is the only main difference? OCing is a very minor thing for most people ..."
3333,What game system are you using?  What kinds of choices do the players have in this story?  Is there any danger  or is it just denial of freedom?  Can they see people outside of the windows?  What happens when they try to contact people on the phone or over the internet?   What are they doing to learn things about their predicament?  How do they discover that they did something wrong and are being punished?  If I were you I'd read Stephen King's short story The Langoliers.  **DO NOT WATCH THE 1995 TV SERIES**
3334,What good is a remaster of games this old  that you almost count how many polygons are in an image?  But of course Rockstar isnt gonna put in the effort to give extremely old games a remake  gamers currently eat up remasters like theyre new games.
3335,What I learned is that I dont know how to take a turn exit.   I always tried to get my car straight as soon as possible so I could accelerate faster. Once an instructor was with me he told me that i drive like shit. I should extend the turn exit as far as I can. Depending on the track  i should go to the very end of the street.   Say I drive a left turn. I should extend the corner so far that my right tires reach the end of the road on the right.   This gave me more stability and pace.  there are track schools and track instructors. I would definitely get one. They are absolutely worth it.
3336,what Intel should have done :  Haswell/Broadwell = 6 core on mainstream platform  Skylake 6th/7th = 8 core on mainstream playform  Skylake 8th/9th = 10 core  10th/11th = 12 core  If they have done above  Sandy/ivy/haswell/broadwell user would have upgrade every core bump instead of waiting till 8th gen.
3337,What is it like? I've been through that ringer more than once.  Well like a normal book  with the exception of the beginning where you're making big picture stuff is easier  but the end where you're filling in for balance  and trying to plug forgotten holes the going gets tougher than a normal book because you also have to worry about making sure the game works with more and more on its plate.
3338,What is it with Microsoft sustaining the $1000+ / 128 GB price line? It looks cheap and third-class.  All Apple Macs are 256 GB or more  [all $999+ HP laptops are 256 GB or more](https://i.imgur.com/wYyLRjY.png) sans Chromebooks  all Dell XPS laptops are (finally) [256 GB or more](https://www.dell.com/en-us/member/shop/dell-laptops/sr/laptops/xps-laptops)  etc.
3339,"What is relatively affordable  fast enough  tons of modification and power gain potential  safe  good looking  has practical luggage room  and comes in manual?  A Volkswagen GTI. Yes  they also come in 4 door versions  but then you lose the ""good looking"" (shots fired).  And these cars are known to be bigger on the inside they seem from the outside."
3340,"what is the worst way you have seen people defend an anime.   for me it's  ""you don't understand the deeper meaning""  every time i hear it i am like  no i do understand it and i still hate it. plus its said anime's fault to be interesting enough for to try to understand it."
3341,What is your history with programming in general? I am a web and app dev  and had no issues transitioning - at least the programming parts. However  I do have a degree in CS and I was doing Unity work where C# was my old main programming language. The tools themselves take longer to learn but are pretty easy to catch up on with tutorials. And screw shader scripting.  I see a lot of web devs (Backend) just making it through CRUD operations on a day-to-day  but don't understand basic OOP stuff  so when we ask them to help with mobile app development  they are stumped.
3342,What kind of car is it? I've had several new cars and I always run it in by letting the oil fully get to temperature every time (and still do)  and then slowly increase the max rpm I'll go to every few days. I try to avoid long highway drives in the first 4k km. And I try to vary the rpm when I drive during this period. By about 2000 km I start to redline the engine a few times. For a turbo car I try to get it to max boost pressure fairly early on (like the first week  but without going to redline  like doing 4k rpm out of a possible 7000).  I've always had great compression on the cylinders on all my cars doing this even 10 years after I bought them.   Keep in mind though that just because this is what I do  it doesn't mean it's the best or only way. Engine break in methods are widely varied and people tend to swear by whatever it is they do. **The only real consistent advice is not to run the car hard with cold oil!* And that's something you should never do anyways on any car.   The second thing is that if you're only going 2 km  why drive at all? It isn't good for the car for what amounts to less than a 15 min walk.
3343,What made you be interested in cars?  Personally  I wasnt a car lover for a long time  but my husband is a big enthusiast so little by little I started noticing beautiful cars and dreaming of driving them. Later on  I became more interested and started reading more about them and so on. Also various subreddits really helped to get more knowledge.  If you know any interesting subreddits  blogs or some other channels about cars  let me know!
3344,What model Mac is it? Are you sure you can't put in an SSD or that cloud storage doesn't work for you?  The new M1 macs are pretty awesome performers. The lower end model (8 GB ram  256 GB storage) is less than $1000. For coding in school  it would be perfectly adequate  but likely so is the computer you already have.
3345,What really saved my p12 and p14 was changing the fan ramp up/down time to minimum. Normally I like softer ramp up but with arctics it means spending more time in the annoying rpm zone. At least my mobo let's me adjust it between 0.1s and 3s or something like that.
3346,"What the topic says. I realize that this somewhat goes against the idea of ""tabletop""  or perhaps really stretches its meaning  but what TTRPGs have been made in which the use of a computer is a core expectation/feature (i.e. Divinity OS 2 GM Mode) rather than an afterthought (i.e. Fantasy Grounds  Roll20  or any number of dungeon delving or sound effects software that exists today)? And  if no TTRPGs really exist like that  are there any blogs or Kickstarters which are currently exploring the topic?"
3347,What time period is this story set in and what kind of budget are your characters working with? Someone in the 90s with a moderate budget ($10-20k) could build up a motor for a fox mustang or C4 that would break 200mph  but the way they'd do it and the tradeoffs they would make would be entirely different than a modern day multi-million-dollar speed shop tackling a cannonball run.
3348,What title says. A little background info  I recently bought my Asus Rog Strix RTX 3080 V2  I was gaming away about 16 hours after i plugged it into my system  and my computer randomly turned off. And it wouldn't turn back on. When i Press power button  literally nothing happens. No fan spin (not even case fans)  No Motherboard LEDs  nothing.  My old GPU (MSI GTX 970) works  and it boots right into Windows.  Weirdly enough  the computer only does nothing when the First out of the total 3 PCIe connectors on my 3080 is plugged in (and recieving power from PSU).  By that I mean  if i only plug in the 2nd and 3rd  it boots up  the RGB on the 3080 lights up  But No GPU fan spin  and No display output  Which is to Be expected concidering only 2/3 power cables Are connected.  Likewise  if the 1st and 2nd  Or 1st and 3rd PCIe cables Are connected  it does nothing. Seemingly confirming the First PCIe cable slot is the problem.  Specs: Motherboard: Asus Strix B550-E Gaming CPU: AMD Ryzen 9 3900X RAM: 2x16 G-Skill Neo 3600mhz CL 16 PSU: Seasonic PX- 1000W Old GPU: MSI GTX 970 4gb (with blower cooler  don't know exact model) New problematic GPU: Asus Rog Strix RTX 3080 10gb V2  Solutions iI have Already tried: Different PSU cables (still from The correct power supply)  Different PCIe x16 slot  Reseating and cleaning GPU pins and socket (with compressed air)  reseating and cleaning RAM connector and sockets (with compressed air)  Using 1 RAM stick and socket at a time  reseating CPU and Its heatsink  clearing CLCRT  Removing CMOS battery for 5 mins and clearing CLCRT again  replacing CMOS battery with an identical CR2032 3V battery.  After all of This  i experience identical behavior  and my old 970 still works in The system. PSU is brand new Btw. Sorry for The essay  Hope someone knows a fix. Cheers
3349,What unexpected and welcome news! Wataten is one of my favourite SOL shows and I didn't know they were making a movie. I also haven't seen anything from Doga Kobo in ages - I hope this marks a return for them in making the kind of shows that they're known for.
3350,What we need more of is tvs that can do 120hz at 1440p and 4k.  GPUs just arent there yet.   My kids play on our Samsung Q80T TV at 1440@120fps and it's just about perfect.   240hz at 1080p would a good next step which this new panel can probably do.  Edit:  We use Steam Big Picture Mode and import all of my Windows Store games into Steam using UWP Hook.
3351,What your describing here is expanding one's fundamentals of art.  Art in video games has long been an exercise in getting more out of less. Strong fundamentals in composition  color selection etc. are excellent techniques for expanding how much one can get out of very little.  Look at the 'powerful' animation of 8 bit Nintendo games like Megaman  Castlevania and Mario. How this was done with so little.  Look how 2.5d fighting games use 3d models but instead of making them entirely fluid they pose in keyframes to emphasize the coming attacks.  Point perspectives  color contrast  shading  all these skills and more can be used to polish up primitive drawings. When you get down to the core of game graphics  alot of it is very simple  and it is more important how it works with the graphics around it then it necessarily being photorealistic  comic book quality etc. (unless your doing a graphic novel).  \*note : I am an idiot  these opinions are just my own.  Good luck.
3352,"What you're describing isn't cynicism but gamification. There are very few games in this world that don't strive off of repitition  including physical ones (football  tennis...).  What constitutes as a ""substantial and fulfilling"" reward is fairly individual. For example  many RPGs require you to farm for levels in order to access more content  which can be a great reward for many  who would like more stuff to do in a game they enjoy. On the other hand  loot-based games such as Diablo 3 basically want you to try and find better gear over and over again  just for the heck of it. And other games  such as Pokemon  basically want to awaken the collector within you.  None of these examples necessarily attract the same crowd  but still follow a similar principle. Again  that's just the base of games as an activity. Repititive or not  they can either bore you or help you relax by simulating an almost meditative state once you're really into a certain part. Some people like it  some don't.  Whether they aid in padding a game is quite dependant on an example. Fallout 4 and the new AC games? Very likely. Yet I'd argue there's enough example of other games which are both entertaining  while still making use of many of these mechanics. (Funnily enough  dungeon crawlers are probably one of the best examples for repetitive gameplay)"
3353,What? It just accidentally squats then stands back up on your virtual corpse 4 times over cuz of some bug or smth?? They definitely did it on purpose but cant legally say they designed a feature where their bots would dip their balls on you repeatedly
3354,Whatever system you end up in  it's probably worth having a table conversation about Lines & Veils with your players to determine what content to have occur 'offscreen'  and what not to bring up in game at all. Having safety tools available can help make everyone feel comfortable and you can decide together what content you should exclude in your vampire game.
3355,What's been going on in scenario larp deserves mention. Look up the Minnesota Make A Scene larp festival. The Scandinavian Fastival  or the Golden Cobra contest.  Otherwise  search up Belonging Outside Belonging games. Great innovation there.
3356,Whats the cat situation like? Do you have one or is it straight pipe? Race cat? Either way  like the guy said before me  why in the hell do you have a 5 exhaust for a Honda? Im assuming you mean just tips?
3357,What's the difference between the class and Job? Are they the same thing or is the Job some sort of power up or enhanced version of the class? Also why is it called Job? I also never understood this thing  someone told me that the difference between class and job is that classes are well the gear you use with your character while Jobs are the things you do while you explore  like for example  gathering materials  fishing (if there's a fishing mechanic) and crafting stuff  but I wasn't sure about that answer  what do you say guys?
3358,"What's the point of the ""storage boxes""?  It feels bizarre to me that items of the same type  but different quality  have to be stored in different ""boxes"" in the first place.  If I have room for three chairs in my warehouse  and I craft three chairs  I expect to end up with three chairs of various qualities and not zero chairs because they came out ""good"" and my warehouse space only allows ""bad"" chairs.  Also  you may want to ask on /r/GameDesign instead."
3359,"whats with all these confusing names of CPUs ?  just say - intel 6core or 8core (maybe year 21 at the end) ... ""intel 6c21"" gonna be 1% faster in games than previous CPUs anyway...regardless how many versions of the same cpu there are"
3360,Wheel hop? Yeah  too much tire grip relative to the firmness of the transmission mounts can cause wheel hop. Havent heard of it personally in a RWD BMW tho  but it could be it. Maybe shes feeling traction control because her tires are too *not* good?  If its at all speeds she needs a balance and/or alignment and/or a general suspension check.
3361,When [Blood was surprised](https://i.imgur.com/ZMxylpq.png) by how fast Will defeated that undead I sure did not expect him to test him with dungeon crawling.  When Will discovered that [what Gus wanted to do was gambling](https://imgur.com/a/1JzOvA1) and Mary wasn't there  [I knew a scene like this was coming.](https://imgur.com/a/rL5OMa1)   Well  good thing that they show an older Will with all of them in the ED  as based on how Gus was acting today I feared that Will was going to have to kill Blood and Gus in their final respective test. But what exactly are Gus's intentions then?
3362,when abandoning a game is a good idea? is it a good idea at all?  ive seen some games that have been let to rot rigth after their launch  it is really sad to see some incredible concepts just being tossed out  so many hours of coding and developing just being wasted.  what makes devs to do that? budget reasons? burnout? or something else?
3363,When any title starts with a question the answer is always yes  Also its interesting how Chris Harris said that this drives more sporty and better than Porsche while here its the opposite  I wonder whos reviewing a car and whos reading the traditional brand review template
3364,When I started playing D&D it was the ONLY TTRPG. When Traveller came along I was drawn to it because of my love of Star Wars and Star Trek. I guess from there I never stopped trying new games. I never quit playing D&D but I love trying out new settings and systems.
3365,When I studied game dev I had a teacher who was at least in his late 50s  and he was doing a PhD in game design at the time. He had massive knowledge about the psychology of gamers  and I believe his PhD specifically was about how to define (and consequently  design) a fun experience.  In my last year at uni on some presentation Monday  he was all cheerful because he had joined a game jam that weekend; it was the first time in his *life* that he (co-)built a game.  Game design is such a broad field that you can be an expert in the theoretical without ever having touched a game engine. I believe Mark is just such a guy; he knows and has learnt an awful lot about game design  but he just never really put those things to practice. I have to say though  that last video showed that he really knows a lot about how to tackle game design; it's just not second nature to him to put that knowledge to practice yet.
3366,When I was about 2... bus was one of my first words. I remember having dozens of Hot Wheels/Matchbox cars when I was a toddler. Posters of Ferraris and Lamborghinis on my walls from the time I was 7-8 until I went off to college. Talked my dad into buying a red Alfa Romeo 164 when I was 14 (so that I got to drive that high school! His cars before that were Oldsmobiles  after it were a Buick and Lincoln).  Love affair has never ended!
3367,When I was about 5-6 years old. At the time  my uncle had a Chevy Nova and an El Camino. He would take my siblings and I out in them. The obsession didn't quite stick for them  but from that moment on  I was hooked.
3368,When I was playing final fantasy VII back in the '90s I always used to think to myself it would be great if they turned this into a live action Hollywood movie and cloud would be played by Leonardo DiCaprio and Mr T would play Barrett and so my question to you is  which final fantasy game or your favorite jrpg game would you like to be turned into a live-action Hollywood movie? And who would star in it?
3369,When people meta-game or cheat at my table I have a three-strike policy.   Strike 1: I take their character's left hand  Strike 2: I take their character's right hand  Strike 3: I take their head.  Edit: Y'all can downvote me as much as you want  but I've GMed for hundreds of people and I've never had to take a right hand.
3370,When starting for the first time on bg1  start as a warrior type class: warrior (and subclasses) paladin or ranger or Barbarian. Reroll stats until at least 88 preferably 90+. This will make your first playthrough more enjoyable. Thac0 = to hit ac 0. Lower is better. Basically game rolls a d20 to see if you hit or not then add modifiers from hit bonuses  weapon bonuses and subtract armor class. So just lower = better and lower ac = better.
3371,When you see a DB5 you think Bond  when you see a DeLorean it's back to the future. It doesn't matter if you don't know anything about cars or even if you've never seen the specific film  if one drives by the average person is instantly going to think of those movies. Are there any other car so definitively tied to one *single* franchise?
3372,When you start looking at high boost applications  a destroke or .2 or .3 of a litre can easily be made up by improved redline and time spent in boost. Have a look at Barra 3.8 strokers on YouTube  skid factory did a good video about building one this year.
3373,When your coworker rejects you  don't keep going back for seconds.  That's how you get slapped with a sexual harassment complaint.  Take the hint  she's not interested in you.  Same with the tool trying to hit on Natsumi.
3374,"Whenever I run a game in a major  well-known setting  I treat the canon as a baseline and alter it to suit my needs from there. As a general rule  I will avoid making mention of any specific characters or events that happen within the setting  unless there's a very good reason to do so (or my players just really like the character/event). For example  if I were to run a Star Wars game  the players would never run into Luke  and for all they know he wouldn't even exist in the game's canon.  But beyond that  I'll gladly mutilate a setting however I please to better suit my dark urges. These might be broad changes  or very minor changes  depending on how easy it is for me to tell the story I want to tell within the setting as it already exists.  For an extreme example  I've been wanting to run a Star Wars game that essentially hinges on the question of ""What if the Emperor and most of his top officials were on the Death Star when it blew up over Yavin IV?"" The progression of events would lead to an unready rebellion trying and failing to form the New Republic  while the former Empire fractures into a dozen+ warlord states as various governors  admirals  generals  and even Darth Vader attempt to take control. Think China in the 1920s. The players would start off as mercenaries caught in the middle of it  and have to decide whether they want to pick a side or just keep chasing that paper.  So essentially you've still got all the Star Wars basics - all the spaceships  planets  aliens  the force  everything that people familiar with the setting would know - but with a wholly new plot of my own design transposed onto it. This allows me the freedom to tell my own story  outside the constraints of what's ""supposed to"" happen in the actual canon.  That said  there's definitely a limit on how far I can go before I have to ask myself why I'm even using an established setting in the first place. That Star Wars setting  for example  is pretty much brushing up against that limit. Eventually it hits a point where it's just easier to make something entirely original."
3375,"Where is Cure Felice?   Like  she is literally the embodiment of life  and put an end to the never-ending chaos Deusmast  which checks all the boxes to qualify as ""Azathoth under another name.""   She and her two adoptive mothers  who only used her powers by the way  got rid of destructive chaos all throughout the universe  and she's been watching over all of creation ever since."
3376,Which devtools or library are you using? From my experience this can make a huge difference.  Personally I find some are really easy to use  like [Phaser.js](https://github.com/BdR76/Phaser3-example-game)  and some are nearly impossible (anything Objective C). At one point I was working in XCode for almost a year and didn't get anywhere beyond moving an image across the screen. Another time I picked up Phaser and it just clicked  had [a complete game](https://www.coolmathgames.com/0-impossible-snake) in a couple of months.  I guess it depends on what you're already used to. I've heard people say they love Objective C  and other people say they hate working with JavaScript. Go figure
3377,"Which Fire Emblem game would you like to see get a remake and/or remaster?!  Note: US releases only included due to limit of poll option slots.  Shadow Dragon nor Echoes included due to being remakes themselves.  The Blazing Blade omitted due to it being a prequel to The Binding Blade which was not released in the US.  Comment any specifics you'd like to see!  I was thinking awakening and fates would be more likely ""remastered"" and the others ""remade"".  [View Poll](https://www.reddit.com/poll/pykr1c)"
3378,Which Gundam? There's about a thousand different series.  I'd always recommend Gundam Wing and my favorite recently was definitely Iron Blooded Orphans.  I'll take the risk of downvotes and say I've never liked Gurren Lagann. I think it's pretty meh.
3379,"Which order should I watch _? Which mainly applies to the Fate series or Monogatari or another show with multiple seasons. Just find the release order and watch it that way. Or if you're too lazy  it doesn't matter. Sure you won't get everything but anyone who pays attention to what they're watching will pick up enough context clues.     Another one is ""Should I watch X?"" In the time between you asking that question and receiving enough responses to make a decision you could've just started watching and decide for yourself."
3380,Which rpg was perfect when it come out  to the point where there is no need for a remake?  For me  its Super Mario RPG. Cute story  endearing characters  good soundtrack  graphics were ahead of its time  and fun side quests/hidden stuff. From what i know  even the graphics were actually limited by the tv technology of its time  so modern tv alone will update the graphics.  Edit: forgot to say  the battle system was clean  classic  and straight forward.
3381,"While I appreciate Samsung taking a new step towards full-brain emulation/general intelligence  recently I've been thinking that we're gonna have to come up with our own ""brain"" instead of copying naturally ocurring ones  just because of how different a neuron and a network of neurons function to process data in comparison to a transistor and a VLSI chip. Knowing the little I know about neuroscience and about computer science  I can't picture us getting to general intelligence  or getting an AI to do it for us  without a country-sized network of quantum and classical processors interconnected through some quantum entanglement shit for data travel speeds. Funniest thing is  we still don't exactly know how the brain works  and we might find a way to travel through wormholes before doing so!"
3382,While Ive heard this a couple years back this is actually a great idea.. unfortunately the connection protocol needs to be unified before they decided to unify the plug..  I saw some bricked Nintendo Switches because someone used an adapter with Qualcomms Quick Charge branding..   i mean this is going to be quite confusing for average consumers.. imagine having the same plug that looks like it should be interchangeable between all devices and turned out it killed each other..
3383,While the IP tie in games are a good way of luring people into the hobby  I think that it always comes with the penalty that people can inherently sense when the game doesn't translate the tone of the setting properly.
3384,While there are seemingly some decent foundations  there is barely any content in the game. Most of what you'll find yourself doing are repetitive fetch quests that come in maybe half a dozen flavors. Some would say the lack of content makes it more of a 'sandbox' MMO  but that just isn't true - the game simply isn't finished. There's very little variety of things to do in the world and players can't really impact it in any meaningful way aside from PvP.  I'd check it out in a year or so - while it is obviously really hyped up at the moment  I've already seen quite a few streamers grow tired it of already having seen nearly everything already between beta tests and a bit post-launch.
3385,While watching the movie I felt the arc could work well in a series format  so kinda curious how they will choose the stopping points (also heard makes the transition to the next arc more smoother). [Movie spoilers] >!I remember being emotional in 2 scenes in the movie so  I want to see if the emotional moments from this arc work again in a rewatch!<.  OP looked good though
3386,While you can get away with no cat in your state due to lack of emission testing it is far from legal and will come back to bite you when you try to sell it. That is going to get spotted fast.  That or you piss off some cop who decides to look for a reason to screw you. A lack of a cat is an open shut thing.  Lastly your car most likely has a sensor just pass where the cat used to be and it will detect something is not right and your car will try to adjust. Best bet contact your insurance and do put a new cat on there. Also look at putting a cat protector shield on their e while you are at it.
3387,Who puts a 5 diameter exhaust on an engine that small?  I cant see any performance gain over a 3 exhaust but its been years since I messed with Hondas.  To answer your question the best solution is to drop back to a 3 exhaust then you have far more options.
3388,Who the hell has internet that is fast enough to stream games well  much less consistently? I live in a major city and our internet fucking sucks  not everybody in the world has fiber or lives in new york or whatever so i dont quite understand where the market for this stuff exists?  Shit half of the time my 5g connection is better than my wifi :(
3389,Why buy a phone every now and then for a marginally better camera when you can buy a pocket camera like the Sony RX100 once and it will be better than every phone camera by a land slide for the next 15 years?
3390,Why do you like (insert form of Western media here)?  It's strange and a bit disturbing how people seem to just turn away from non-anime works especially if they're the type of person who proudly call themselves otakus and other similar terms. The inverse is true as well but anime watchers seem to pester you more about it.
3391,"Why don't you like ""X""?  Not so much the question itself but because how most people get so butt-hurt at my answers. If a viable discussion or friendly debate came from it  that'd be cool but of course this is rarely the case."
3392,Why havent you watched X yet  its so good   Sometimes its a legit question  but other times its them being annoyed you havent watched their favorite show. Like  maybe its just not my type of show? The worst is when they start shoving the show down your throat anytime you bring up watching anime.
3393,"Why is ""game journalism"" really a thing. It still baffles me that ppl go out of their way to read shitty articles from random website that is more ads than writing instead of just watching a 5 minute gameplay. What's even worse that game devs actually give a shit bout what game journalists say these days even though they know actual players don't give 2 fucks if the game gets a good review on games. They really need to stop paying ""journalists"" and instead pay streamers and youtubers to review the game cus that's what players will actually pay attention to."
3394,Why is it allowed to release code for an OS that regresses current generation flagship hardware by 6x?  If your patch doesn't maintain the status quo to add support for a new piece of hardware that nobody has yet it should be rejected.  If AMD released a Windows patch that killed Intels latest cpu performance it wouldn't go through.  This really stinks of malicious intent.
3395,Why is travel interesting in real life? It's because you're seeing things that you don't normally see. Here are some ways you can frame this as story conflicts:  - what route are you taking? Is there a chance of getting lost? Is there a shortcut that comes with a risk?  - Are you going to need to eat? Rest? How will you find safe places to do these things? Are the food and accommodations different than what you're used to?  - Are the people different here? Are their manners so strange you might offend each other? What about language? Even if you speak the same one  accents and dialects can be a big obstacle.
3396,Why not just get one of those cheap VR boxes where you put your phone in? That way you get both a better display tech (OLED) and potentially higher resolution (around same res with a tall 1440p smartphone  and higher with a 4K smartphone)  and you're not limited to proprietary apps that this unit probably is.  The latter is quite important  as watching videos and movies is a big part of the experience on mobile VR. Or at least in my opinion...and experience.  I'm sure this unit makes it easier in certain ways. But $500 is a lot to pay for a glorified Google Cardboard   imo.
3397,Why not lift a plot from a favourite book  film or TV show that they don't know. You could also go with something that you're really into at the moment. There could be inspiration from a non fiction area. Is there something you and the kids share a common interest in right now? For example  say you're all madly into kite flying at the minute. You could work that into a story. If they got new skateboards or bikes they could have PCs having adventures with their skateboards.   It's so near to Halloween that that could be a theme  without scaring them too much. How about a Scooby Doo or Adams Family solution?
3398,Why? The Wolfenstein devs are the Doom devs (all Bethesda/Xbox)  seems to me they already have that area covered without bringing Quake back.  Then again  they own Quake too  so I guess they can just have all the FPS's if they want.
3399,Why?? There's a GTA game on pretty much every system from the last 3 console generations  and almost all of them are on PC  The series has made an entire universe that thrives on satirising this kind of corporate fuckery  and now Rockstar are giving in to temptation by milking their most popular franchises and leaving all the others dead in the water  Seriously  what about that Bully sequel we keep hearing about once every century? Midnight Club or even Manhunt? It's not like they financially can't take the risk
3400,Will is a gullible child who wants to protect everyone  i wouldnt be surprised if he ends up as a gods child or a hero.  It would be funny if he doesnt give an oath at all and tells all gods to fuck themself
3401,Will it work?  Is it complete? What happens when it doesnt?  Tesla fucked up massively and hasnt been able to deliver. What makes Rivian think that they will?  I am not paying for glorified cruise control.
3402,Witcher 3 has a very  very good core design that will not age badly; and the graphic engine is very good too  and it won't age badly either.  As for price  Witcher 3 is one of the few modern video games that deserves the full MSRP  so the steep discount that you're seeing is an absolute steal.  All of that said  I would not play the game on a base PS4  but only on PC or PS5 (once the next-gen upgrade arrives). If you play the game on PS4  it's 30 FPS  and that can be quite painful in 2021.
3403,Witcher 3? I don't know how it plays in PS4 though  but I played it again a few years ago and don't remember any game breaking bug. It's a huge  detailed game  so do expect minor bugs. But nothing deal breaker.  Divinity Original Sin 2 is not open world  since it plays in chapters and eacg chapter is tied to a specific map. But they are big enough with good content so it doesn't feel linear at all. The developers were also very open when designing this game  so anything that be seen as a bug  is there so you can either bypass it or exploit it.
3404,With my previous group was something like that   Start a new campaign on a different game>Play some sessions>Someone fucks things up or get bored  sometimes happened real life problems where we couldn't do anything about it >We interrupt the campaign>Repeat  For five years  not totally bad players or bad people (Sometimes stupid)  actually we were long time friends but this was our average campaign
3405,Woah  so the rumours were [true](https://www.carexpert.com.au/car-news/2022-subaru-levorg-to-morph-into-wrx-wagon). And it really is just a renamed Levorg with the WRX drivetrain. No manual option mentioned  but no plastic cladding or a massive bumper butt.  Also  that split second clip of the WRX Concept between 0:58 - 0:59.
3406,Wonder Egg Priority - I loved the first episode so much  I watched it 5 times before continuing with the series. It set up my expectations with such a beautiful atmosphere  heavy on themes of loneliness  depression  dreams  and finding/losing a friend. There was a lot to wonder about (hehe) from the first episode.   Sadly  it kind of crushed my expectations as the show went in a different direction from episode 2 onwards.   Still has the best visual art Ive seen in an anime  and the best soundtrack Ive heard in an anime though.
3407,Wonder if they'd ever consider redoing GTA1  London and GTA 2 in one package.  They're very different games  and I quite liked 2  but they're quite old now. Wouldn't want to pay loads for them  but getting them to work on new hardware would be nice.
3408,"Word of advice: when you keep hitting walls because you don't know enough (or you get the feeling you're failing because you're asking the wrong question) try cutting back the scope of what you're trying to do.  What is your MVP? Your Minimum Viable Product?  What is the very least the project (or project portion) would need to have for you to consider it complete?  Does completing this component bring you measure closer to the completion of the project as a whole  or is this aspect a ""nice to have"" sort of thing?  If the wall you're running into isn't part of that MVP  then set it aside and work on something that is.  Completing portions of the MVP is incredibly motivating  not only because each portion brings you measurably closer to finishing the project  but also you'll be able to stand back and lean on what you've accomplished so far when you're questioning if you're actually making headway.  If you've completed portions of the MVP  then you'll be able to honestly answer ""yes  and here's the evidence.""  Happy to answer any questions you might have about what the MVP for your project would look like either here or through DM."
3409,Working with teams is both natural and pretty good idea as you get better/faster/more ambitious.  I have been amazed how much I can get done though using fundamentals of art. One  two point perspective. Mechanical drawing. Understanding figure drawing proportions etc. Composition  Color Theory. I'm a terrible artist  but using a lot of classic fundamental techniques I can get alot more work done than anyone would imagine. As I expand into technical animation more  I'm starting to see non-artist starting to do things traditional arts have a very hard time doing. And doing them faster!  Great example here!  [https://youtu.be/LNidsMesxSE](https://youtu.be/LNidsMesxSE)  Well  I'm half asleep. I do wish you well  I understand the frusturation for sure. Just understand  YOU ARE IMPORTANT :). Gotta find that self-worth otherwise all the artist you work with will just drive you insane. Of course I don't have that problem as I'm already insane.  Good luck!
3410,World trigger is really good at making the characters feel intelligent and the world seem real. On top of that it juggles the huge number of characters well without having them seem too similar or forgotten.
3411,"Would personally never use a map like this. The whole idea of a battle map is that it gives a good overview  and from above is the logical angle for that. How would you put a token that has climbed on top of the statue? Their actual position would be the base of the statue but ""up""  but if you put it on where the actual head of the statue is  their position overlaps with somebody who is simply standing a few tiles north of the statue."
3412,"Would probably be nicer if the inference was much quicker given that's what's more likely to be doing CPU ML most of the time  but still nice to see it does something - anything more than 2% perf improvement ""for free"" is worth getting out of bed for!"
3413,Would you get all down about yourself if some crazy guy screaming at pigeons turned around and started calling you names? No he's crazy wtf does he know. Same thing with this little psycho fan. Don't get down on yourself you made it  you released a game and developed a fan base you MADE IT that guy was who had nothing better to do than that creepy shit? What's he doing with his life other than getting yelled at by his mom for leaving his cum Kleenex all over the floor in his bedroom
3414,Wow  *really* not good advice in the other (apparently popular opinion) comment. Sorry OT.  Yeah you should *definitely not* use music from other works in your own game. Not only is the game industry not immune to the same legal requirements as every other industry  but a number of very high profile lawsuits have been issued even in recent months over music ownership  with every single case that has so far been settled going to the plaintiffs or settling in the plaintiffs favor. Hundreds of millions of dollars has changed hands in the game industry over music as a result of lawsuits  *just this year*. If you are caught using music you did not get permission to use  you are highly likely to have action taken against you  and just to reiterate here: every single person that plays your game is a potential vector for triggering the awareness of the copyright holders. People look out for that kind of thing and have a very high sense of indignation when it comes to this stuff.  Mother was a very unique circumstance that you are unlikely to find an equivalent for.  If you wanted make your own music that was derivative of something else  then that is likely to be totally fine as long as its different in some meaningful way. But you absolutely do not want to be using other copyrighted music in your game under any circumstances.   Sound samples are also not something worth getting hassled  there are thousands of sound libraries out there with any kind of sound you could possibly need  and they are overwhelmingly cheap  and you can find free sounds from places like (I think) Soniss where they package hundreds of sounds each year and give them out for free.  Ive been with several studios over the last two decades  and let me tell you that lawsuits are not as uncommon in the industry as people think  its just that they usually get resolved quickly out of court because its almost always clear when someone is in the wrong  and both sides just want to stop it from happening again and move on.  Check out unity assets and various places where they sell sound libraries  you can find them for very cheap  and sometimes for free.
3415,Wow  a d66  that's pretty cool! I don't have any tables for you  but you could take any d100 table and just remove what you like least. There's even a subreddit for random d100 lists; however  I've forgotten what it's called.
3416,Wow  I dont know my cars design was actually frozen in 1999! Well kind of  as it looks like they were pretty much with the design back then.   I looked up the XVL concept and found out that the EXTROID CVT was also developed and debuted at the 1999 show along with the Skyline  and would later be used in some Skylines in Japan and Australia. That means Nissan was involved with CVTs as soon as Renault came in the picture lol.
3417,Wow  Minisforum shared a video of their assembly process in which they showed people using wireless ESD wristbands? That's just blatantly admitting that they have absolutely no knowledge of electronics.
3418,Wow  okay then. Theyre just using a random brand/franchise/game title generator to not only name their games but apparently decide the genre.  Cant wait for Tom Clancys Assassins Cry Recon: Sam Fishers Crew.  Ubisoft. The blender that takes all your favourite games and makes them one generic sludge thats really hard to swallow.
3419,Wow I hope they do a great job. I played over 300 hours of Tropico 6 during the summer of '19! I love that game on the hardest settings. Loved balancing the business/economy building  beautifying the housing  organizing everything so the military could defend. Let's see if Tropico 7 raises the bar! Some of the pathing and nonfunctional stuff was disappointing last time.
3420,"Wow this episode felt like 5 mins. Intrigued by the story  loved them interactions. Despite being an iseikai  most of this is not cliche. I was kind of expecting him to say in his monologue the lesson he learnt was ""not to get caught"" instead of the fairly straight laced ""don't get hooked by gambling""."
3421,Wow. Very impressive VW. Still offering a manual AND 43mpg AND over 150hp and 180lbft in a VERY handsome package(in my opinion) for ~$20 000.   Now if only they could make them last longer than the warranty lol
3422,"Wow.. I get that too.. I almost always feel depressed once everyone heads home after a game session and like JudgeMatro I have a hard time sleeping afterwards. The later part I get  but the depression part surprises me.. I kinda get the ""well that's that for another week...back to the grind""..."
3423,"Wrap it up and start something new. Unless it's deeply not-fun  announce that you want to wrap things up in n sessions to wind up the main loose ends - 3 is probably a good number. It might even re-engage the other players now that they have an end-state coming up.  Having a set number of sessions is a really good tool in general  I think - you can always have a new ""season"" if there's still steam  but you also have an end-point for people to aim towards and time-pressure on everyone to have things happen sooner than later  and not have it peter out into a listless blah."
3424,Wrath is better on the RPG front  but it feels a little unfair; Solasta is a different kind of game -- a strategy combat game with a fraction of the character creation choices of D&D  and no real roleplay options in the sense of branching paths.  I liked Solasta for what it was  and I don't even like combat  but if you have only one chunk of money and/or time to spend  go for Wrath (and by the love of God install mods that kill off the mandatory mini-game).
3425,Wrath of the Righteous is worth it  and you can still recruit mercenaries to create your whole party.  Solasta: Crown of the Magister makes you create your whole party from scratch. Theres no pet class  but there are summons. Druid and Barbarian are announced to come out with the first DLC  not sure if theyll include animal companions  since theyre going to implement fan-made classes.
3426,WRITE DOWN THE VIN/keep an old copy of your registration with your VIN on it. It may come back to you. I wish I had the VIN to an old vehicle I had. Probably been crushed by now (39 year old vehicle)  but it would be nice if I could search public records to find out last place it was registered. But I moved away from that city  and without the VIN  I'll never know. Good luck to you and yours.
3427,Xbox has been on AMD since then  so it's all good.  I wonder if Nintendo will give AMD a shot (edit: for Switch 2). The latter seem like amicable partners  and they recently made the APU for Steamdeck. Nvidia comes off as generally disinterested in the console SoC business.
3428,Xenogears  Star ocean 2 and 3  Chrono cross  chrono trigger  Final fantasy ix  Trails in the sky trilogy  then 4 trails of games soon to be translated games  then trails of cold steel 1-4.  Personal mention  drakengard 1.  Valkyrie profile 1 and 2  Xenosaga 1 2 3  Y's 8 and 9  Tales of berseria and arise where both really great games also.
3429,"XP for non-combat related content (disarming traps  discovering locations  etc.) and randomized loot are fantastic. Non-combat XP is something that helps some games support different play styles (pacifist for example). Randomized loot can help increase replayability.  That being said  I couldn't disagree more about AC Odyssey and FO4 being ""addicting"". I can't play those for more than 5 minutes without getting dreadfully bored  the above mentioned mechanics notwithstanding."
3430,Yakuza: Like A Dragon. Very fun weird game with a lovingly crafted comedic gangster story and some awesome characters. Combat is fun  the 'job' system of classes provides some really interesting options and routes to take. I highly recommend if you like modern settings and some very lively characters.
3431,Yawn. Judging by FFXV being an unfinished mess and 7R being a piecemeal offering where you get a 5 hour section stretched into 30  I'm not excited in any way. FF is nothing more than fading name value relying on past glory.
3432,"Yeaaa  gross. My XPS does this too. However  it _seems_ that its possible to disable ""Modern Standby"" in Windows now as of v2004:   - https://borncity.com/win/2020/11/26/windows-10-v2004-cant-deactivate-modern-standby/  - https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/iot-core/learn-about-hardware/wakeontouch#disabling-modern-standby  I'll try this on my 2018 XPS 15 (9570) and report back...  _Edit:_ Boom! Got it working! [Goodbye ""Modern Standby""...](https://imgur.com/a/PB9F8R9)  -----------------------------------  _Edit 2_: **WARNING**: /u/gamebrigada pointed out that newer (2020+ XPS models) don't properly support S3 sleep  so **disabling modern standby could be majorly problematic**. [Check his post for more info.](https://www.reddit.com/r/hardware/comments/pupouc/do_not_leave_windows_xps_laptop_in_any/hehztji/)  _Edit 3_: I just recently updated my XPS to Windows 11 and had to perform this process again. The upgrade removed the registry key I added and re-enabled ""Modern Standby"" (S0). Luckily  performing the same process to disable ""Modern Standby"" worked in Windows 11  so no issues there. Just wanted to note this  in case anyone runs into this in the future."
3433,Yeah  I find this quite relatable. Personally I have a pretty active Telegram chat with the folks in my play group  so we post memes and chat about the game afterwards - it helps a lot. Though  I have to say  what makes this possible is that all people in that group are super enthusiastic about TRPGs and almost always willing to talk about them.
3434,Yeah  I sometimes get this way too when working on mechanics (less with writing or art). I think its at least in part because the headspace is so detail-oriented and necessarily just kinda obsessive.   For me  I do best when I just acknowledge that my body doesnt want to go to sleep. So  if Im laying there tossing and turning  Ill get up and do something chill (e.g. read a book) and let my body/mind wind down.   Also  exercise  stretching  breathwork  rolling on tennis balls  etc. is SUPER helpful for me.     Hope this helps!
3435,Yeah  one games buggy launch ruined creativity in the largest most well funded part of the industry. /s   Youre jumping to industry wide conclusions based on months (weeks?) of bitter contemplation about one game  and another game that Im not sure has anything to do with Arkane or Bethesda.
3436,Yeah  the skill sets aren't nearly as transferable as they seem like they should be. I got a degree in game dev and didn't have a problem with any of my game classes but nearly failed web dev. Just stick with it and you'll have something playable soon enough!
3437,"Yeah  totally.   Look  in storytelling you don't judge whether or not to have a character do something on the basis of ""'is it optimal"" or ""is it sane."" You judge it on the basis of ""is it believable"" and ""would that character do it?""   Is it believable that a character would compromise their ideals or ally with a former enemy to save the thing they love? Absolutely. Would your character do it? Well  that depends on them. Are they radicalized and short-sighted enough to follow their ideals to self-destruction? Many people are that way. Only you  the owner of the character  can make that call."
3438,Yeah I don't think anyone here expected Eugene to actually live bruh wouldn't stop raising death flags and I am sad he is dead...but FIDO is back. Best boy/dog/robot is running and rolling around and I am loving every second of it. It just hit me Frederica kind of reminds me of Towa from trails of cold steele at least in appearance just slightly. Also 2 episodes without Lena.
3439,Yeah I have this problem too. It's gotten to the point where one of my players ask me if we are going to stick with the game every time we start a new system. I don't really have much advice beyond picking a system that ties in with something you're really passionate about and it has a chance if lasting longer. For example I'm a big Star Wars fan   and thus I am able to have fun running a Saga Edition game that has been going on for like 2 years now. The issue is I run two games and keep changing systems with my second one.
3440,Yeah I sold my first car  a VW Bus  about a month or 2 ago. It was a very sentimental car for me  did a lot of stuff with it through my life but I can't afford to fix it and it was taking up a ton of space. It really sucked  one day I'd really like to find another one when I've got the money to make one really nice. What helped a lot was that the new owner is extremely excited about it and has made it a project with his family. He sends me pictures of his progress sometimes. Makes me feel good that someone is appreciating and enjoying it.
3441,Yeah I went the opposite route from games to web dev and I agree.   When I was working in games I had to basically do things like trig  calculus  inverse kinematics  geometry  physics  etc pretty regularly. You are also often developing in what I would call underdeveloped (comparatively) languages  engines  and tools often with a lot of proprietary elements that really bog you down.  I got paid literally half and worked twice as hard in games. Web dev is an amazing job in comparison. It's insane how mature tools that do such a small part of the pipeline are. I still can't find a decent way to handle state in games with most of the game world disagreeing on even basic approaches while the web world has entire paradigms and libraries JUST for managing state and to an insanely more comprehensive level than I have ever seen in even some of the largest games.  I really recommend you keep making games though as a hobby  it really expands your understanding of programming.
3442,Yeah it is some way of sampling  and if done wrong you can get in trouble. But i wouldn't worry because it might just be considered ok since it isn't taking important melodies from songs. Plus Nintendo didn't made the sounds themselves. They sampled from instruments like the Korg wavestation or the JV 1010  so Nintendo has no rights anyway.  Now how did he? People rip game data from games with sequenced music  like earthbound. They rip the instruments and convert them to a different format. then they take all the ripped sounds and mix them into a .sf2 file (a soundfont). Toby most likely downloaded it from the internet  but I'm not sure. Then he'd use a digital audio workstation (daw) and bang some bangers. Toby uses FL studio  quite a good daw. Hope it helps!
3443,Yeah it really sounds like you should. I'm no expert but does it seam like players like their characters? I'd switch to another system so they could transfer their PCs story to maybe something else. I don't know many fantasy games that aren't world specific and aren't dungeon crawlers sorry.
3444,Yeah it's failing the self test POST. This happened to me when I built my pc.. it turned out one of my RAM sticks had a fault  it was brand new. I had to sticks of RAM. So I took one out and left one in  powered it on and it still happened  so I switched the RAM sticks and it turned on.. it turned on with 1 RAM stick  so I had to send the other one back for replacement.  I'm sure someone has suggested something like this already  but just worth mention.
3445,Yeah its totally insane  and I completely agree with you. I have about 6 unfinished solo projects that I think are good ideas.   Each one was more simple than the one before in an attempt to just finish one no matter how simple  but every time I still hit an impassable roadblock and put it to the side.   Definitely feels horrible and causes imposter syndrome  but at the same time the feeling when you pull something off is amazing. I guess thats why we still do it.  To this day Ive never finished a project and Im years into it.
3446,"Yeah I've been checking in... There was a moment where I was feeling like ""oh wow when 3080 Ti's hit $1 400.00 on ebay. They're trending down  I'm gonna say fuck it and buy one"". I was giving myself that price range because that was around what I spotted for MSRP at MicroCenter.  They instantly started going the other way. 1 800.00 to 1 900.00 average as I'm watching it now. Its trending up for sure."
3447,Yeah that sounds like pathfinder it's very combat focused. If you've been playing since March I would keep going. I've been running avernus since March as well and it would feel like such a waste of time if it wasn't finished. I would try to introduce something of your own to try and reinvigorate the campaign. Maybe try to appease the invested player by having some enemies who talk etc
3448,Yeah. And I bet lots of us with that problem congregate here on this sub lol Back in the day I played a lot of 3.5 and White Wolf games. 5e brought me back in after a long hiatus  but didn't hold me for very long. I've been system hopping for a few years now.
3449,Yeah. But you need to be in the right mood. I also fell sleepy watching this and I tried several times watching an episode a day. It didn't work.   I suggest to try to binge a few episodes given its very slow pace just to get you familiar with its plot and world. A little warning it's a very sappy and heavy drama story and it is episodic.
3450,Yeah. Ive tried playing kingmaker twice and stopped at kingdom management both times. Since then Ive put about 40 hours into wrath of the righteous and crusade management isnt that bad. Ill probably give kingmaker another chance sometime. I hope if they make another pathfinder game they just leave the grand strategy aspect out. It really adds nothing
3451,Yeah... Web dev is like 1/10 of what you should know to make a game  it's just like a layout part of the game  the way you do the menu or something  when there is also the code  graphics  animations  sounds  etc.  But don't give up! Start with something small and simple  maybe even with Drug and Drop and GameMaker Studio 2. If you really like playing games and have passion about making them  you can eventually do it  but yeah  it's ain't easy... And even if you make a decent game  spending like 10 years to study it  and like 2 years making it  there is still a very tiny chance to get rich  successful and famous just because you are competing with huge ass studios with a lot of people and budget.  Also  consider starting with making some modes for the games you like  this is a good way to get into the process.
3452,Years ago I bought a '92 MR2 with a JDM turbo swap  and I'm currently in the process of trying to repo it from my mechanic. I'm pretty sure when the market on those skyrocketed he tried to swipe it from me.
3453,Yeeeessssss!!! Me too! I used to hate MMO's and as soon as I hit 30 i started playing Diablo and ESO.  Taking my time reading through EVERYTHING twitching here farming there.   Like i cannot get enough of ESO. Glad to see its just not me
3454,Yep  I think we've done about 7ish different systems in the last 2 years  but everyone knew in advance that we were going to be changing systems a lot of get a real feel for what is out there on the market. I feel like it has been pretty successful  and has introduced us to a lot of cool new systems  and ways to play. This year we had largely settled down into Forbidden Lands but player interest in that is waning  so we will likely move on to Blades in the Dark or the new Teeth module when that comes out.  My only real advice would to be let everyone know your intensions ahead of time. Ask the players what it is they would like to play so they can get involved in what system is chosen  and make it clear that you are looking to only run a 1-3 shot game  and try to make the story arc warp up in that time.
3455,Yes  and a list of resources to do so are laid out nicely in the sidebar:  https://www.reddit.com/r/rpg/wiki/rpgonline  Be aware that the crunchy and tactical games like DnD  Pathfinder  Warhammer 40k  and Shadowrun 5e want a virtual table top (vtt) with a grid and tokens. Most others you just need a way to roll dice (look into discord bots).
3456,Yes  because it makes roleplay easier if the players have some pre-existing understanding of the history and style of the world they're playing in.   It means they're more comfortable adding to the world themselves without having to read the entire lore section of the corebook.
3457,Yes - because it's very badly designed.  They are a new studio who tried to build too big of a project for their experience level.  Which is why this part of the game is poorly thought out and not fun for me.
3458,Yes  daily drive all of them and modify every single one. But my modification style is extremely subtle (OEM+)  its for this reason I believe that my cars sell at the high end of the market when I let them go despite the mods.
3459,Yes  highly tempted. Usually I try to take a break to avoid the burn-out rather than switch systems/campaigns.  One thing I should really do is to only run one shots/short campaigns with the New Shiny and be clear about that from the start.
3460,Yes  I know  use stock assets or just try your best.  That said  for those of you in the same boat and who actively participate in game jams  do you find it at all demoralizing to do so? Or do you prefer to seek out an artist to help out?  Of course either way is perfectly fine (not that anyone needs my approval)  but which do you prefer to do? Whats your preferred approach?
3461,Yes  it's sad. But so is everything in the life :D  >  so many hours of coding and developing just being wasted.  Yes  it hurts :) But an alternative is to waste even more hours of coding and developing. If nobody needs/plays/(buys?) the game  it's a failure  time to stop crying  learn from mistakes and move on  welcome to the Real World.  > it is really sad to see  If it's sad... why not leave a comment for the devs? Give them heads up? Give the game a good rating? Maybe they've abandoned the project because they had no marketing and the game ended up with 20 free downloads in a year  and that's all. They just don't know you are sad and think nobody cares  so no point in fixing bugs or pushing updates; or maybe even time to give up and get a different  more rewarding hobby.
3462,Yes  this is why I started my 6 week rule. We commit to a game for either 6 weeks or 12 weeks with a break in the middle. It has made making sure everyone can attend sessions so much easier as we have built in off weeks. If a game is going really well after that time we setup a sequel or season 2. Sometimes we lose people for a season due to schedule or just not clicking w the game and in that case we look for a filler player for the next set of weeks.
3463,"Yes  yes  YES! I'm so glad it's finally out! I've been following the manga for years  read it through 3 different times. This was one of my ""i want this to be an anime NOW"" picks for so long. I'm so excited!"
3464,Yes and no.  49 here too.  We had a great game going before COVID.  We meet up every other week online.  Playing DnD  but most of my experience was other RPG systems.  I adapt.  We also have a few game bars out here (Kansas City) so there's some opportunity there.    The good news is the youngsters appreciate our imaginations!  I like seeing the games through their eyes too.  But I get your point  I don't want to feel like a creep in a group of kiddos!    Usually FB groups or meetup groups can be used too when you're trying to find a game with 'like minded' strangers'.  Also  volunteer to DM  that will get you players - lots of people want DM's because Adventure League will only go so far.
3465,Yes and yes.  90s GM tech suuuuuucks.  So getting away from OBD1 and vacuum actualted things makes the truck more reliable. I do want to LS swap it only because there is not a lot of LV3 (LT V6) for the truck.  I guess I could try and do that myself.
3466,Yes i just went through this. Im 24 and worked hard to get a 2015 dodge challenger scat pack. It was my dream car and i was so proud of it. It was my child. I decided on a return to university and couldnt afford it without work so i had sold it. Only thing that keeps me going is a new goal of buying a new one after school. Whether not thatll be realistic or not  it helps to have hope haha
3467,yes it MATTERS  to compare the IPC for generations.  like from Pentium 4 3.5GHz to Core to Nehelem to Sandy to Skylake to Alder Lake  then compare with AMD Phenom  bulldozer  Zen 1 2 3.  Someone need to do this.
3468,Yes it's a great anime to start with. Cowboy Bebop and Black Lagoon (currently on netflix) are great starting animes as they don't really rely too heavily on tropes and have a lot of western appeal. Both shows have really good english dubs as well
3469,YES THEY ANIMATED THE VANAGANDR JUMP!  Rip Eugene  but that's what you get for talking about the future and your little sister in an anime like Eighty-Six. I already knew what was gonna happen but i think it was obvious even for anime onlies
3470,Yes tyre shake is absolutely something that happens with 10 000hp top fuel dragsters. I dont think a road car is going to get tyre shake especially not a 3 series. Not sure whats causing it but its not the rubber.
3471,Yes! I'm actually 3/4th of the way through and honestly love it. Has its little quirks but I genuinely get excited to load up the game. :)  Wrath of the Righteous from what I've seen/read is even better!
3472,"Yes.  General rule I have is to never start a campaign for a system I am currently reading. You may run one-shots for a currently reading system  but never start a campaign for it. This gives you a cooling off period from the ""new hotness"" so that you only get jazzed and make campaigns for things you are genuinely interested not currently obsessed over."
3473,Yes.  The Falcon that I bought with the intention of using it as a daily driven track hack has now tripled in value (purchased for $4.5kaud)  to the point where I am receiving offers from people on the street to buy it.
3474,Yes. Virtual Table Tops like Roll20 or Fantasy Grounds are fairly common to facilitate play  but aren't required. In the past I've played theater of the mind games in early 2000's chat rooms. It's been close to five years since I have played TTRPGs in person just due to my job and many of my TTRPG playing friends being spread out around the US and abroad due to varying career paths.
3475,Yknow I recently played BG1 as my first CRPG. I played a little 5th edition D&D  but not much.   I had a lot of fun. The graphics and controls didnt bother me at all  reminded me of playing RuneScape lol. The tutorial does a great job of explaining everything combat. The story and quest design still hold up with some of the best RPGs. The companions and characters are all great as well.   I will say the game is pretty tough tho  I had to drop it down to easy difficulty to finish some encounters. I would recommend looking up a guide on THAC0  it took me a while to figure that out. And maybe make sure you have dispel magic spells  and protection against petrifaction. I hope you check it out  I had a great time.
3476,Yo just last week I was thinking about how GTA could possibly come to the switch Logistically. I came to the conclusion that with a little work they can get all the games up to IV on Switch. (The switch is slightly more powerful than an XB360 soooo)
3477,You are going to deal with this no matter what. But let me give you some advice:  1.Address it publicly 2.Join the fan made discord server  and talk with the community every so often 3.Maybe host a small event to make it up to them  At the end of the day  players will complain no matter what  but if you do all of this  it isnt from a lack of trying  and most will probably understand better
3478,You can always home brew something and just use an existing system as a guide. For example D&D 5th edition is the one out now but if you wanted something harder grab D&D 1st edition and if your party runs into the undead they will be in for a huge surprise. You can also mix and match rules as long as the don't conflict with each other.  You say you want to do something long. How about stringing multiple quests together? Start out simple with with a go here to save the villagers quest and just have it snowball into something bigger and bigger and bigger until you are doing something epic like killing an undead dragon in the 7th layer of hell to save the world.
3479,You can basically ignore the kingdom management  you can turn it onto auto  and you still spend most of your time being an adventurer.  Also the whole point was that your character signed up to get a barony.
3480,You can buy these cheaper on ebay or such. It's annoying though that steelseries had to use a basically non-existent  special connector. Except ss headsets it's only used in some Nikon cameras if i remember.
3481,You can definitely make games in Unity on low-end hardware. I mean  games were made in Unity for the first iPhone back in 2008.   As long as your computer is able to run the Unity Editor  you can make with it. But you definitely want to learn about how to target low-end hardware. A good starting point would be to pretend like your computer is a mobile phone  and look up articles and tutorials on how to optimize games in Unity for mobile -- Since a lot of these tips will apply to your computer as well.
3482,"You can drop it. I know that it feels awful to leave a story unfinished  but this is one of those cases where you may want to. The story doesn't really get worse or better  but depending on your approach the finale can be extremely unsatisfying. I know it was for me. I'm talking ""I was blocked out of the option I wanted for reasons that were never foreshadowed as a possibility."" kind of unsatisfying. The difficulty spike during the last two chapters is well known  and again  it doesn't feel like a satisfying challenge at the end  but rather throwing some unreasonable sh\*t at you to make the endgame seem longer. And the characters don't get any better  I can tell you that for free. Unless you like the combat enough that the two hardcore chapters seem enticing (I really liked the combat as well  but that was too much for me) there's no satisfaction to be found there."
3483,You can take a look at the source code if you want. The relevant function is CBasePlayer::TakeDamage. A detail others have not mentioned yet: explosives deal bonus (double) damage against armor (only in multiplayer though).  https://github.com/ValveSoftware/halflife/blob/master/dlls/player.cpp
3484,You can try JavaScript frameworks  like Babylon.js. Unlike many other JS-based game engines  Babylon has extensive documentation  and working in a more familiar environment might help lessen your learning load.  Also: Mark Brown  the guy behind GMTKa YouTube channel that's put out incredible  high-quality content about game designrecently started his own game *development* journey  and [he's given tips and lessons for newbies](https://youtube.com/playlist?list=PLc38fcMFcV_uH3OK4sTa4bf-UXGk2NW2n) I wish I'd heard back when I started out. Maybe check it out.
3485,You can try out [The Contract](https://www.thecontractrpg.com/). It's fairly easy to learn given all the tooling / guides on the website  it's 100% free  and playing with whoever shows up on a given night is a primary feature of the system.   Not going to lie  if you run it straight your chaotic stupid guy may die once or twice  but dying isn't as big of a deal in The Contract as it is in other systems  and he'll get a reward that lets him start a new character with powers.
3486,You can use this calculator to input your current tire specs and the new size you want to go to.  It will show how much your speedometer will be off by:  https://www.discounttire.com/learn/tire-size-calculator
3487,"You can watch it but one piece have better world building than x  Not hating on one piece fans  but holy s all of my friend who read/watch one piece always compare my ""currently watching"" anime to it. Please. Let. Me. Enjoy. What. Im. Watching"
3488,You could always run an older edition of Vampire (like 20th Anniversary) but can you be more specific on the sexual aspects that you dont like? It may help us narrow things down when it comes to other systems.
3489,"You could casually call it out. I've done it before. The idea is to put them on warning.  ""You got that good a roll again? That's a little improbable don't you think?""  They will of course deny any misdeed.  ""Ooookay  if you say so but that just looks suspicious. We'll go with it though.""  Very rarely do they push it after that. They still cheat  just not as egregiously."
3490,"You could get a LG OLED 48"" tv that will still do 120hz 4K for $1300 (lower if you catch a sale) plus an ultra wide 32"" LG Nano IPS for $850 and have A LOT more screen capital by having one display for video and infinite contrast with HDR and the other for work/productivity or photo editing and that would be around half the price of this thing."
3491,"You could make a ""catch the poachers"" game  with something like a 1-100% protected ecosystem rating. Introduce various real world anti-poaching organizations that give out missions.  You will raise awareness and care  then perhaps you can provide links after each mission to how to support each organization / species... or something like that... just a thought."
3492,You could perhaps use a set of five intransitive dice known as Grime Dice to represent the [Chinese five element](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wuxing_(Chinese_philosophy)) system.  * A (Wood): 2  2  2  7  7  7  * B (Earth): 1  1  6  6  6  6  * C (Water): 0  5  5  5  5  5  * D (Fire): 4  4  4  4  4  9  * E (Metal): 3  3  3  3  8  8  This results in the overacting and weakening chains of relationships:  * Wood > Earth > Water > Fire > Metal > Wood * Wood > Water > Metal > Earth > Fire > Wood     I have no idea if that is useful but it is an interesting outcome.
3493,You could try looking for maps made for Legend of the 5 Rings. Its a fantasy samurai game inspired by Japanese culture  but it should suit your purpose well enough. Modules and sourcebooks usually have maps included which you might be able to find online. I know the Emerald Empire setting book has some sample maps of castles and towns.   Also these were recommended on the rokugan subreddit: https://marketplace.roll20.net/browse/set/912/vile-tiles-historic-japanese-village  https://marketplace.roll20.net/browse/set/699/isheii-empire-map-packs
3494,You did quite well for an indie game... however if you crunch the numbers its still great but it starts to look more like an income of an  'average business'. I hope you can shine a bit of light on this part?   So... roughly 1.800.000 over 6 years. (or 8 years if you count the prototyping phase). Deduct costs (taxes and such) 50% is optimistic. So 900.000 for 2 persons.  If you are an entrepreneur  and you are from the sounds of it  you need most of this money to 'create the next game'. So that 450.000 each suddenly isn't that much money (especially in western countries like Germany) if you need this money to cover 6 years of your own salary (or more  until your next game hits the market and starts paying) AND pay for development of the next game.
3495,You didn't learn web development overnight. It probably took you years to get really good at it. It's the same with game dev. It's going to take time.   My advice is don't get into the trap of following tutorials. You should make small games first. Copy simple games like Flappy Bird. Look up specific areas where you need help with like making a object scroll across the screen.   Game Makers Toolkit has a great video about this topic:  https://youtu.be/vFjXKOXdgGo
3496,You didnt say what year and specific model.  If it has X-drive (all-wheel drive) and the tire circumferences are not within spec the driveline could be damaged.  If the OE tires were staggered sizes and the new ones are not  that could be an issue too.  Dont drive the car if that is the case.
3497,You do realize that the cat is not a muffler  and that the increase in noise is from a component being missing in the system  causing the system to end short of the existing muffler?  If yall dont require emissions testing  Id go the route of straight piping it. Should be quite a bit cheaper  and nobody will steal your cat again
3498,"You don't hear people say ""oh I lost .2 of a second because my tires gripped to much."" The mechanic is just trying to cover up a botched or rushed job. Sometimes it's the mechanics fault  whops  or shop manager or owner. Sometimes multiple"
3499,You don't need to put yourself in a box. If you're not enjoying it don't play them. Maybe you'll have a resurgence some day and start to appreciate it again. Gaming is just for fun though  no need to force anything.
3500,You don't really need to know dnd - i don't  i'm a casual - for baldur's gate. it has a lovely atmosphere  I always remember the rain in that game. If it's cheap give it a go. Dragon age origins is a beautiful game and worth considering too  and pillars of eternity/tyranny are also more modern CRPG games that are good. I did not like divinity OS2  i found it a mess of systems that make it hard to play casually and it was not very captivating to me.
3501,You have LotGH as #1 favorite? Then youre an elitist who hates anime!   Bruh I also like Demon Slayer & other popular stuff. Why cant I have the one of the best anime ever made as my #1 favorite?   Im not pandering to anyone to show I have good taste  I just enjoy those shows more than your average anime.
3502,You have to do your own engine.  First you load your assets  then you have a loop until the escape conditions are met.  There are libraries that allow loading 3d graphics depending of the file format  there are others that make an abstraction to OpenGL /DirectX so you can simply speak about scenes  cameras and entities or so. There are others for physics and collisions. The more of this you have  the less you have to develop.  Or you can skip all that completely and use Godot or unity  spare 1-2 years developing the engine and then only do the 3d assets and use the engine functions to do the phisics and game logic. I recommend you this last option. Unless you want to learn engine creation (and then I would say that you could then fork the quake engine or help develop Godot) and/or want to work for unity or epic/unreal. Nowadays almost no studio makes their own new engine from scratch.
3503,You know  I know people think Intel changing their node naming nomenclature was faux pas.. but I'm glad they did. I think this article spans like 9 N-type naming schemes. Having Intel somewhat aligned at least gives perspective and sets expectations - that are then on Intel to actually meet.
3504,You know I've come across what I felt was some wisdom from a girl who had to sell her Golf GTI and downgrade to a Polo GTI instead? She said while her ride downgraded  she views it as an upgrade to her life because she has relieved her financial burden. So whatever you have done to make your life more financially bearable  take it as that you've made the right choice. As you have put  it's not a necessary cost and I'm happy that you accepted this. As long as you're still able to make money  you'll have the chance to get it back!  And also a word of advice (not meant for OP) to those who are starting out as workers  please  think before you make a financial commitment. If you need a vehicle just for traveling  it's worth thinking twice before getting your dream car at this stage. We all have dream cars that we could die for  but if you are earning just enough to pay the monthly loan installments  it's a harsh truth that you can't afford the car because you have little or none left for fuel and maintenance costs. It's a sad problem that I've seen in a lot of young car owners where I live.
3505,"You know what  if you're inviting a player to play any game with you  you are going to need to be accommodating.  My guess is that your player finds your creative agenda at odds with their idea of ""roleplaying""  and to be fair  you may come across as a bully  whose playgroup is looking for a novice to feel superior to.  I hope that's not the case.  If that player needs to be level 2 or 3  when the rest are level 1  would it actually negatively affect the enjoyment? Only if there is a ""competition"" and seeing if the newbie dies first  right?  Be kind to the new player. Personally I give them what they need for their first character to be memorable a Kirin like Falkor from Never Ending Story  a Genie like Iago from Aladdin.. You want them to enjoy your company  participate  and collaborate telling a *good* story. They will retire their PC and start at level 1 when they are comfortable with your group.  Put yourself in their shoes  they haven't hurt anyone  encourage them rather than shame them. Or you know what? You would be that bully.  Tyvm"

Beginning with games is similar to starting with the ugly HTML formatting and wondering how you make those pretty designs for web pages. Just think of this as the boring basics you need for the really cool stuff later one.
3507,"You may see a lot of discussion about how AMD tried to ""reinvent the Pentium 4"" with Bulldozer by chasing clock speeds with a narrow core and a long pipeline. That simplistic view really misses the point of what AMD was trying to accomplish with Bulldozer  which I think is a bit more nuanced.  Bulldozer was an architecture designed for highly-threaded server workloads in an integer-heavy  heterogeneous computing world  where most heavy floating point processing would be offloaded to the GPU. This is not the ""right"" architecture for gaming workloads (which are lightly-threaded  branch intensive and love low cache/memory latencies and high clockspeeds). But for server workloads  the concepts at the time were generally sound. It was an Opteron first  Athlon second architecture  because the datacenter was  and still is  the fastest growing high-margin CPU market.   In order to do this  AMD attempted to fit two cores in the die space of one and a half cores and call it clustered multi-threading  or CMT for short. This was done using a module design where a module is two logical cores with their own ALU  with a shared front-end and shared FPU. This was seen at the time as a middle road between trying increase the number of traditional fast  complex x86 cores and using a higher number of simpler  weaker cores (like the direction SPARC went). Doing more work and using up less die area is one way to compete with Intel's smaller (and more economical) processes.   On that count  they were not really that successful - a single 32nm Bulldozer module (2 ""cores"") took up less than 80mm^2  versus 115mm^2 for two  full-featured traditional cores of the preceding 45nm K10 Magny-Cours.  Here's what in general made Bulldozer worse for gaming  at a low level:  **Decode**  * [The front-end could decode only 4 instructions](https://www.anandtech.com/show/4955/the-bulldozer-review-amd-fx8150-tested/2)  shared per (2-core) module  down from 3 per core in K10. This got fixed in Steamroller  with each logical core getting its own dedicated 4-wide decoder. * The front-end didn't have any sort of macro-ops (not micro-ops) fusion  which lets some x86 instructions get combined before decoding  effectively widening the front-end.  **Branch**  * The longer Bulldozer pipeline made branch the [branch misprediction penalty](https://www.anandtech.com/show/5057/the-bulldozer-aftermath-delving-even-deeper/2) higher (20 clocks!)  higher than K10 (12) or Core 2 (15) or Nehalem (17) or Sandy Bridge (14-17). The cost of a longer pipeline shows up here. * AMD's branch predictor was better than any of their previous designs  but still significantly worse than Intel's (though Intel had had better branch prediction for a fairly long time  even when AMD was competitive). * Bulldozer didn't have any sort of op cache like Sandy Bridge did (though one was added in Steamroller)  which exacerbated the branch misprediction penalty.  **Execution**  * The ALU was only 2-wide (vs 3-wide in K10). * The"
3508,"You might be able to find ""Godwin's Cabalistic Encyclopedia"" on the internet  which though dense should be pretty helpful.      https://www.amazon.com/Godwins-Cabalistic-Encyclopedia-Llewellyns-Sourcebook/dp/1567183247"
3509,You might find what youre looking for with Neverwinter Nights. The campaigns the game comes with are on the longer side  but there are countless fan made modules which vary in length and scope. Some of them are only a few hours  but are split into episodes. [The Prophet series](https://neverwintervault.org/project/nwn1/module/prophet-prologue-it-cannot-be-denied)  for example.
3510,You might like Earthbound or Mother 3  which are easy to emulate. Mother 3 has a really touching story.  For GBA  you might like Golden Sun  but its been a while since I played it  so I dont know how long it will take until you fight your first enemy. Also on the GBA  if you like Mario  maybe try Mario & Luigi: Superstar Saga.  You mentioned you played Persona 2  maybe youd like to try Persona 1 on the PSP  it is a first person dungeon crawler  but it does take a while for you to fight the first enemy.   Or you could try Pokmon Emerald  its a really light game  and you can easily finish within two days  and there is almost no exposition and  your party can be overpowered in no time if you know what youre doing.
3511,You might want to look up your College/University VLSI curriculum and the definition of ASIC.  It might surprise you.  Reading out the hiring ads of the actual companies Nvidia  AMD  Intel might give you an idea what they are expecting.
3512,You must become the most powerful character of all time and Kill Goku  you start off with only two abilities  1) to warp into any anime world at any point in time. 2) you steal the powers of those you kill but only the powers they had at that specific time point you killed them.   There is no limit to the number of powers you cab hold and no limit to how many times you can warp. How would you do it?
3513,You need proper education to make games. Alot of indies jump into game development without a plan or actual game development skills or software knowledge.   Do you have a game design document? Do you know what that is?  Have you made a game from scratch via tutorial?   Can you 3d model  animate ect?
3514,You need to figure out if this is an actual compulsion or a habit you've built up.  Set up some rules. Here's some examples.  1. Monday is game day. I prep 1 hour before and write notes 1 hour after. No screens.   2. Tuesdays  Wednesdays and Thursdays. I refine my notes and take notes from things I see or think of.   3. Friday and Saturday are days of rest. The notebook gets put away. I watch movies  play video games and watch T.V. for me.    4. Sunday. I prep my game. 1 hour of video and notes. 2 hours of prep. I will get X  Y and Zed done.   Your rules don't need to be the same but if you set yourself boundaries and break them  it's an actual compulsion and you need help because it's becoming a detrimental obsessive behavior with negative effects on your life.
3515,You own all these toyotas but can't find one person with a techstream or a locksmith that will do it cheaper.   You can get uncut transponder keys for about $10 online and another 20 for a locksmith to cut and program it.  Techstream can disable all the annoying beeps as well.
3516,You played the game Warhammer chaosbane? Was on games with gold for Xbox  it's not great but it's solid For just playing while Listening to music or an audiobook. story isn't too important to the missions for the most part And it's not that great either  so you can just tune out and enjoy the gameplay relatively easily. Skyrim and AC Odyssey were also good for that type of stuff with me
3517,You said that your character voices are good. Build on that - the GM is a character. I'm a trivia host/event MC by trade and the voice I use when hosting a trivia night or event is not the same as my regular voice. As a performer  I take a lot of inspiration from carnival barkers and Vogue ball emcees and game show hosts. Tailor it to your GM personality - are you a wise sage directing them through their adventures? A wily tempter leading them into trouble? The sly behind the scenes advisor to the king?
3518,You should be fine as long as you get the wiring harness and dash kit you need for the installation. When putting your card info into Crutchfields stereo finder it mentioned to  replace the low-impedance factory speakers with standard 4-ohm aftermarket speakers so you should look into any potential issues with that
3519,You should be looking into electrical engineering rather than computer engineering. The two are drastically different fields of study and work.   Electrical is where you will find most of the hardware design stuff. CS and CE is where you are going to find more of the stuff on software  coding  and integration.
3520,You'd hate FF IV lmao. Literally cycle through characters constantly with only Cecil being static.     And they constantly kill off party members throughout the game  i.e. wasted grinding lmao.     Great game but that does suck.
3521,You'll really want to get the full four year Bachelor's  not just an Associate's  but more important than that is specialization.  If you want a job in the game industry you want to be *really good* at one thing  you don't want a broad base of weaker skills. You need to figure out if you want to be a programmer  game designer  animator  modeler  producer  or whatever else as quickly as possible. If you want to be an artist then focusing on animation classes is great  but if you want to be a coder (or a designer) than those are essentially a waste of time for you. Don't try to do everything and if your program does that don't be afraid to change majors.
3522,"You'll want to look at a couple of things.  First  is /r/VTT. This is the subreddit for ""Virtual Table Tops"". A VTT is a piece of software (generally) designed for the purpose of playing tabletop RPGs online. There's quite a few offerings  ranging from ""free"" to ""fairly expensive""  and they have a wide range of capabilities and RPG system support.  You can take a look at [this excellent overview](https://paper.dropbox.com/doc/Cyanomys-Guide-To-Playing-RPGs-Online-v2.0--AyCzhfF1A6uMrcwL6APODsBnAQ-Ef83ststlhPqW0LELrgye) of the various VTT systems out there  including a brief description of their pros and cons.   If you're specifically looking for people to play with  /r/lfg is a good place to start.   Skype  Zoom  and Discord are commonly used for video and/or voice.   I personally use Foundry VTT at the moment with TeamSpeak for voice communication."
3523,Your argument boils down to asserting that despite having the defining features of an RPG  per a specific definition you've put up as popular  something is still not an RPG because what is roleplaying is inherently obvious without ever providing an alternative definition of what makes roleplaying roleplaying.
3524,Your car is not that old  dont understand why they would recommend the replacement. Brake fluid absorbs moisture but that should not be big issue by 2y old car with that mileage.. dont know what can affect coolant properties..Maybe besides boiling it or mixing with oil..
3525,Your first track day is going to be spent just getting comfortable and learning.  In fact  you'll learn quickly that you are SLOW.  That's ok. You have to get a certain amount of laps under your belt before you have the experience and confidence to go faster.  Don't push it right out of the gate.  No need to be a hero and wad up your toy.  Keep it on the asphalt.  No need to push hard as a beginner.  Make damn sure you get an instructor in the passenger seat - for some reason unknown to me  some track groups don't have this as an absolute requirement.  Find one that does.  Try to ride a few laps with advanced drivers after you have some laps under your belt.  See what they do and compare it to what you have been doing.    The driver's meeting should cover all the rules  and hopefully some basic introduction to weight transfer dynamics.  There will generally be designated passing zones on straightaways  and you give a point by to the driver behind you  letting them know which side to overtake you on.  This ensures both drivers are on the same page.  Also  do NOT pass a slower car without getting a point by.  And let faster cars go - there should be no ego in the beginner group.  Beginner rules - break in a straight line.  Two hands on the wheel except when actively shifting.  Keep an eye on your engine temps.  Show up with tires and brake pads above 50%.  New brake fluid.  SNELL rated helmet 2015 or later for most run groups.  Fast laps aren't about how hard you can stand on the gas pedal.  Believe it or not  it's how hard you can stand on the brake pedal  and manage grip to carry the most speed through a turn.  Fast cars go fast down the straights.  Fast drivers go fast around the curves.  Enjoy!
3526,"Your play priorities are supported by a lot of ""narrative"" RPGs - if you want to dig through Forgean archives for system ideas I think the label for what you're looking for is ""vanilla narrativism"".  That said  I think it's still very possible to get that ""immersion"" feeling from games that give players more narrative control. It depends from what lens the game expects you to make these decisions - if you have to make them from the point of view of 'is this good for the story?' then no  it doesn't work. If you're making them from the lens of your character's experiences though  I don't think there's any contradiction. Also  if these decisions are limited in where they're applied  I think it doesn't break the immersion significantly.  ""Character immersion"" is a very subjective thing though  so it's a bit hard to pin down in conversations like this..."
3527,you're all still here. you're all still supporting blizzard and you all know damn well you'll buy everything they release. All of this fake Reddit shit is hilarious.  You only have to play ONE of their titles or view ONE of their conventions to know how Blizzard has ALWAYS treated women but omg a lawsuit materializes and you all  turn into Steve Harvey.    Give me a fucking break.
3528,You're buying a $65 000 luxury SUV and you're worried about spending the extra $10 a tank on gas?  You realize how ridiculous this sounds  yes?  Genesis recommends premium. Is there a reason you do not want to follow their recommendation?
3529,"You're correct  Input is a class and GetAxis is a (static) method of that class. The return value is a floating point number ranging from -1.0 to 1.0 of type float. The string value  that you're passing into the method (""Horizontal"") is a parameter of the method.  The type of input parameters is separate from the return type of the method. GetAxis takes a single String parameter (the name of the axis you want to read the value from) and returns a floating point value (the value of the axis that you asked for).  PS: Floating point variables (float and double) are not limited to 6 decimals. For example the lowest positive number (excluding zero) that a float can represent  has 45 leading zeros (0.000...014013). Don't worry about the details for now. Just keep in mind there's a bit more to floating point numbers."
3530,You're going to want to check out the Diablo series. I'd suggest Diablo 3  it's much more new player friendly. Don't worry too much about the plot  you can always get a recap on YouTube or go back and play the first two if you actually get interested.   But the Diablo series is a near endless cycle of killing stuff and upgrading equipment. It's not open world though. It's very linear through the main story  then just running through randomly generated dungeons forever.  Diablo 2 is around 20 years old and people were still playing  and it just got a remake. Diablo 3 was on PS3  but still has people playing on PC  PS4  and Switch. It's really that addictive. A lot of similar games are referred to as Diablo clones for a very good reason.   If all you're looking for is kill stuff and get loot  kill harder stuff and get better loot  and kill harder stuff faster and get better loot faster  that's exactly what Diablo is. Other games do other things better  but if this is your priority  it's the itch these games were made to scratch.  I'm 40 years old  and I don't think a year has passed since high school that I didn't play a Diablo game for a while.
3531,You're mostly correct  although those weren't coalition talks. Coalition talks will start next week. They were just trying to figure out if they wanna start coalition talks or not. Either way  no speed limit
3532,Youve discovered that even though the gameplay logic for turn-based games is simpler to reason about  it may be more difficult to design how your code works!  > At the moment it is quite messy  I only have classes for game entities / tiles and all the rest (logic  graphics and user inputs) are in one same file (even though my graphics do not interfere with the logic  but they are still in the same place).  Think of your code in terms of modules rather than classes.  In modern JavaScript (I have no idea if you're using modern JavaScript  though)  a module is a single file  which has some `export` and `import` statements. There are plenty of rules that people have come up with for how to structure modules  but the most important concept is cohesion.   https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cohesion_(computer_science)  Basically  if you discover that you are going back and forth between module A and module B all the time just to address one thing in your game  it's possible that you have bad cohesion  and you should reorganize modules A and B. Or if you discover that module C is so large that its hard to navigate  you try to split it up into new cohesive modules  C1  C2  C3 (or whatever).  > I read the whole day about using specific design patterns such as the Model-View-Controller.  These patterns are quite reasonable  but dont get too dogmatic about any of this stuff. People run the real risk of trying to figure out how to implement MVC rather than how to get my code working  using MVC. I hope that distinction makes sense to you. You should be spending most of your time thinking about the problems you are actually solving (your game) and not diving into philosophical questions like what *is* a View? because thinking deeply about those questions is almost never helpful.  The MVC pattern is a tool to help you write more *cohesive* code. Its just one tool (and some think its outdated or obsolete... dont worry about that)  * Your gameplay logic is the M  so any time you need to rebalance the game  add new attacks or powers  etc.  youre starting with the Model.  * Your rendering logic is the V. It draws the Model on screen  using 2D Canvas or WebGL or something else.  * Your input handler is the C. It allows the user to Control the game. It takes mouse clicks  keyboard presses  etc. and uses those inputs to modify the Model.  Here's a quick sketch of how you can implement animations:  - During play  your game has two different states: waiting for user input and playing an animation.  - If theres an animation playing  then each frame  you update the animation. The animation changes game state. User input is rejected. Once the animation is done  move to the waiting for input state.  - If the game is waiting for input  you process any user input. This may trigger a new animation to play.  There are tons of ways to make animations work. There are  for example  very generic and simple ways to do this. For example  you can use tweening
3533,You've got a solid ontological horror setup there. It sounds fun!    They start trapped in their apartment (oof)  perhaps that has symbolic relevance - maybe it's a fantastic downtown location but a senile old man used to live there and the group conspired to get rid of him so they could live there  but the old man was senile because an eldritch horror was using his mind as an egg to hatch itself into existence  and its pissed off now.   Depends what kind of genre you want to lean into.
3534,You've identified the unfortunate dilemma of game dev: having to choose between your own needs and those of potential employers.   If your goal is to get a job making games  you may actually want to take a look at Unreal. I'm a longtime Unity user so it hurts to say that haha  but at my college career fair I got told by every prospective employer to switch. Now that's definitely anecdotal  but in looking around for jobs myself I've certainly observed that the studios using Unity are generally smaller and therefore not hiring for full time positions  whereas the big studios (i.e. the ones able to hire lots of people  so more chances at a job offer) are more likely to be using Unreal than Unity. And that's if they aren't using their own custom C++ engine anyway.   It also kind of depends on which aspect of game dev you're interested in. If you want to do art or sound  your choice of engine probably doesn't matter as much as your portfolio. If you want to do programming  C++ offers more opportunity for employability. If you're primarily interested in design  it may actually work better to stick with what you're comfortable using to most efficiently showcase your ideas.
3535,ys 8 and 9  Yakuza like a dragon  Wildermyth  Way of the samurai 3 and 4  vampyr  Persona 4  Solasta  the legend of heroes trails of cold steel. 4 games out atm  edge of eternity  days gone  9th dawn 3  Arons adventure
3536,Ys 9 is fantastic. Super fun exploration  cool story  fast combat and enough stuff to do that it never once felt stale to me. Plays great on PS5.   Tales of Arise just came out and is also great. Combat is a blast  graphics are awesome and story is pretty good. I havent finished it yet but its kept my interest so far. Also is like 90% on Metacritic I believe.   The Nioh series is pretty sweet if youre up for a challenge. Its hard  especially at first  but once you get the basics down it plays fantastic. Fast and flashy combat  tons of equipment and skill points to play with and an addictive mission system.   Yakuza Like a Dragon is turn based but combat is still pretty fast paced. Huge city with TONS of stuff to do  great characters and a cool job system. There are also tons of JRPG and fantasy references.   Also check out Bloodstained  Trials of Mana remake  Star Ocean (last hope is a good starting point imo)  Rogue Galaxy and Ni No Kuni 2.   Best of luck!
3537,"Yup  it is very difficult! But like most things a lot of it comes down to what you enjoy. For instance I tried learning some web development and did not enjoy it  so the class I was taking was very difficult. But major props for you to try your hand at making some games! Keep at it!  Not sure which engine you are using  but there are a lot of native tools to help speed up and learn the process. I use Unity which has microgame templates you can build on top of. Essentially ""completed"" games that you build on top of to make what you want. Super useful for new devs!"
3538,Yup I feel the same. I used to play games like LoL  Diablo  Final Fantasy and Dragon Warrior ... but they just feel boring and repetitive after a bit. A friend gave us their old copy of Skyrim. I got about an hour into the game and was overwhelmed and bored. I felt the same with Sunless Sea ... great concept  but overwhelming in detail and narrative.  Switching things up for awhile helps. Board games instead of video games  reading books. Learning to code and building my own games helps  too  and especially checking out what other indie devs are doing in the genre. Finding new takes on a genre I love is always fun.  Slumps come and go. Give it a bit  come back to your favorite games another time when you're feeling excited to play them.  Hope this helps!
3539,yup. it's crazy hard  even to make a really small game.   and I also agree that web is easier  I've made many websites  and while I do still run into blocks all the time in web  I'm usually able to overcome them in a day or two. but sometimes in games i just give up the whole project.
